    "This project is based on data acquired from Reddit -- \"The front page of the internet\". Reddit's developer-friendly API was used for data scraping, and returned a treasure trove of text (a key requirement for this Natural Language Processing effort). Nutrition and Medicine are the two \"subreddit\" classes selected for this project. Generally subreddits with larger user communities generate more posts (i.e. more data). I chose to scrape two closely related subreddits: Nutrition and Medicine.\n",

    "\n",
    "In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now we're going to put those skills to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For project 3, your goal is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.\n",
    "2. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is add `.json` to the end of the url: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames.json\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use Reddit's API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y3ZE26Ciuk\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.\n",
    "- **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a Bayes classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.\n",
    "- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.\n",
    "- An executive summary of the results you found.\n",
    "- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip 1:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip 2:** Reddit will give you 25 posts **per request**. To get enough data, you'll need to hit Reddit's API **repeatedly** (most likely in a `for` loop). _Be sure to use the `time.sleep()` function at the end of your loop to allow for a break in between requests. **THIS IS CRUCIAL**_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip 3:** The API will cap you at 1,000 posts for each subreddit (assuming the subreddit has that many posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip 4:** At the end of each loop, be sure to save the results from your scrape as a `csv`: JSON from Reddit > Pandas DataFrame > CSV. That way, if something goes wrong in your loop, you won't lose all your data.\n",
