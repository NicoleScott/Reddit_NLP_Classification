How to encourage coworker to eat better?,"I have a coworker who lives off of white bread pb&amp;j sandwiches and sugar. He's in his early thirties and is the pickiest eater I've ever met. Guy couldn't recall the last time he ate a vegetable when I asked him.

Whey &amp; Acne,"Not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit for my post but I wanted to share my findings.

As a teenager, I had flawless skin aside from the occasional pimple. However, as an adult I've struggled with acne breakouts. At 31 years of age, it's still a daily battle. 

I started lifting weights when I was 18 years old and have been doing so pretty consistently since then, with the exception of a few several-month hiatuses over the years. What goes hand-in-hand with weightlifting? Whey protein!

About 6 months ago, I hired a nutritional coach. He builds me meal plans, which I stick to for a week at a time. During this time, I started to notice a correlation: some weeks my skin was worse than others. On the bad weeks, my Whey intake was 90 grams / day while on the better weeks I was down to 30 grams / day. I observed the pattern for a few months until there was no doubt in my mind. I asked my coach to limit my Whey intake to less than 50 grams / day and things improved. Last week, due to certain foods I wanted to include, my Whey intake had to be increased. I was back to 90 grams / day and within 3 days my skin was terrible.

I decided to do some research and, lo and behold, there were several hits on Google regarding the link between Whey and acne. It seems to only affect some people but I was certainly being affected. Apparently, it increases oil production on the skin and hair and, of course, oil leads to acne. I already have oily skin to begin with so it's no wonder that this was a problem for me. I decided to  give plant-based protein a shot to see what would happen. A week later and my skin is more clear than it has been in YEARS. 

Anyway I just thought I'd share this in case someone else is suffering from the same issue.

Sugars,"Hi people! 

I have recently noted that an increasingly number of people have started to believe that sugars are really bad. Now with that being said I know that processed sugars are in fact bad like the ones found in processed foods, pop, candies, etc. But when it comes to natural source sugars like the ones from fruits and veggies it seems like they’re not harmful at least not in small amounts (it’s not like someone would eat like 20 apples in a day) and they also provide with other micronutrients that are beneficial to us. 

So I don’t have a specific question but a few. 

Is it healthy to go on a completely 0% diet? Like literally no veggies, fruits, grains, etc. 

Is the sugar found in natural sources any bad to our bodies? 

Thanks to everyone who can give me some advice into the topic. 
Also thanks for reading all the way down here.

However, seafood has issues with microplastic and other things like mercury.

Does the health benefits from eating seafood worth getting these bad substances into our system? 

As another question, what about for the case of a vegetarian, who doesn't eat meat but is fine with eating oysters.

Association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality among US women and men: two prospective cohort studies,"“Objective To evaluate the association of changes in red meat consumption with total and cause specific mortality in women and men.

Design Two prospective cohort studies with repeated measures of diet and lifestyle factors.

Setting Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, United States.

Participants 53 553 women and 27 916 men without cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline.

Main outcome measure Death confirmed by state vital statistics records, the national death index, or reported by families and the postal system.

Results 14 019 deaths occurred during 1.2 million person years of follow-up. Increases in red meat consumption over eight years were associated with a higher mortality risk in the subsequent eight years among women and men (both P for trend&lt;0.05, P for heterogeneity=0.97). An increase in total red meat consumption of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 10% higher mortality risk (pooled hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.17). For processed and unprocessed red meat consumption, an increase of at least half a serving per day was associated with a 13% higher mortality risk (1.13, 1.04 to 1.23) and a 9% higher mortality risk (1.09, 1.02 to 1.17), respectively. A decrease in consumption of processed or unprocessed red meat of at least half a serving per day was not associated with mortality risk. The association between increased red meat consumption and mortality risk was consistent across subgroups defined by age, physical activity, dietary quality, smoking status, or alcohol consumption.

Conclusion Increases in red meat consumption, especially processed meat, were associated with higher overall mortality rates.”",nutrition,1560437672,Only8livesleft,115,76,True,2019-06-13

Meat Dogma.,"New studies show a 9% increase in mortality associated with meat consumption. (This post is obv gonna be downvotes to Oblivion) normal human rationality shows that anyone who believes this is mentally ill and probably suffering from a few vegan associated mental health issues. Very stupid study, just pure dogma. People who eat meat had like a 10% increased risk of certain things, so what? There's a collection of other factors that could lead to such a small difference. What was their overall diet? High carb + high fat = inflammation atherosclerosis diabetes and a lot of other things. If 1/100 of these people ate a lot of sugars with their meat that could shift the balance. It only accounted sweetened beverages for carbs. What about bread? Potatoes? Alotta people have meat alongside a plate of starches. Maybe in a hamburger with bread, sugar sweetened sauce and low quality American processed cheese? Eggs and sausages with bread, hash browns and a cup of supermarket milk? Steak and mashed potatoes with veggies sauteed in vegetable oils? Don't see anyone talking about that, some dumbasses even cook their meat with vegetable oils. It's only like a 10% change in certain factors! Of course you're going to see that.

Time-Restricted Eating to Prevent and Manage Chronic Metabolic Diseases,"“Abstract

Molecular clocks are present in almost every cell to anticipate daily recurring and predictable changes, such as rhythmic nutrient availability, and to adapt cellular functions accordingly. At the same time, nutrient-sensing pathways can respond to acute nutrient imbalance and modulate and orient metabolism so cells can adapt optimally to a declining or increasing availability of nutrients. Organismal circadian rhythms are coordinated by behavioral rhythms such as activity–rest and feeding–fasting cycles to temporally orchestrate a sequence of physiological processes to optimize metabolism. Basic research in circadian rhythms has largely focused on the functioning of the self-sustaining molecular circadian oscillator, while research in nutrition science has yielded insights into physiological responses to caloric deprivation or to specific macronutrients. Integration of these two fields into actionable new concepts in the timing of food intake has led to the emerging practice of time-restricted eating. In this paradigm, daily caloric intake is restricted to a consistent window of 8–12 h. This paradigm has pervasive benefits on multiple organ systems.”

OMAD (One Meal A Day)?,"Has anyone tried or does OMAD? I currently intermittent fast for 16-20 hours and was gonna push it to One Meal A Day...

I intermittent fast purely for satiety reasons and mental clarity.

I posted in a topic earlier saying i am certain my gut microbiome is in a bad state. I took Antibiotics a year ago and it has never recovered properly since. This has led to a series of appetite issues.

Whenever i break my fast i can have a massive meal but i still go on to crave a lot of sweet foods. I have tried every combo of meal to break my fast but it still is the same outcome.

Whenever i fast.. I wake up and dont eat anything at all for about 6-8 hours and in this period i have no hunger ' Zero Cravings and my mental clarity is amazing. I can train in a fasted state and feel great. No blood sugar issues etc.

Soon as i break my fast i feel lethargic' Brain fog' insane cravings ' Constant hunger. I think of foos constantly after my first meal and it drives me crazy.. I'm sure this is linked to how bad my gut microbiome is in?

My idea behind this is to just have one meal a day  and close to my bed time. I would intake the same calorie amount in this meal (3000 cals i usually shoot for) i have an awful appetite so can easily cram this amount in. So if i do feel tired etc i can just go to bed and sleep and i always wake with zero hunger ' No cravings in the morning so would just do the exact same routine that day.

Would this be a good idea? I do weight train so keep protein intake high. Just wondered if the one meal will still stimulate muscle repair. I have read that one meal if in a surplus will still build muscle?

Would this daily fast be of a benefit? I know autophagy is good for your body. The main reason is for satiety and also mental clarity overall

I've been paying for supplements that weren't as potentially helpful as they could have been.

Contradictory viewpoints by people with different ways of eating/cherry-picking advice from the same sources.,"This isn't against a particular way of eating, I believe there are benefits and drawbacks to every type of diet out there.

However, this does seem to be more prevalent in those that follow more extreme diets or those that are restrictive in types of food in some way (keto/carnivore/vegan/HCLF etc).

***Why do those that follow a particular way of eating dismiss evidence or other pieces of information/advice even when it comes from the same organisation/resource that offers support or positive evidence for their way of eating?***

Example..

* Some will criticize/demonize the WHO (World Health Organization) by dismissing their conclusions that red meat is possibly carcinogenic or that processed meat is carcinogenic - yet blindly accept the WHO's classification of smoking, asbestos or other substances are harmful?

* Generally dietary advice by governments around the world is the same - high fibre, balanced diet including moderate non-refined carbs etc. Many dismiss this and some claim its some kind of conspiracy and mention 'Big Pharma' influence. Yet - these same low-carbers will still blindly follow vitamin/mineral intake advice/RDIs set by these same governments - an area 'Big Pharma' would likely have even more influence in!

* A lot of people who eat a certain way will dismiss/find holes in every study that concludes a negative view of their way of eating. Yet when they provide a study that backs their way of eating, and someone criticizes it/finds holes, they get very defensive as if every study that backs their way of eating is perfect.


You get the point - some people will choose to 'trust' or dismiss certain pieces of information from a particular source, yet if that same source provides information for another topic, they will view it with a different level of trust.

I think the government/'Big Pharma' one is an especially worthwhile talking point.


I find that low-carb followers inparticular will dismiss government health department guidelines on diet/nutrition - yet are perfectly happy to completely trust those same health department guidelines on RDIs for all the mineral/vitamins our body needs without questioning it.

Question: is this too much fruit? Is the amount of fruit I eat unhealthy?,"I'm a 26 year old woman, 5,4 tall and weigh around 123 lbs. I've always absolutely loved fruit, I think it's my sweet tooth. It's my favourite thing to eat and it always has been. I am also a bit greedy and not always great at portion control - I'm capable of eating quite a lot of fruit in one sitting. 

At the moment, I'm trying to reduce processed foods in my meals because I'm quite sedentary right now and don't do enough exercise to work off anything calorie-dense and processed. That's not very fun, so I'm also making an effort to try to listen to my body and give it what it wants -- just within the boundaries I've set. But for some reason at the moment it just wants A LOT of fruit.  I know it would probably be better if I replaced some of my fruit portions with vegetables... but fruit is just so tasty. 

Here's an example of what I eat on an average day:

\- 2 pieces brown toast with 2 fried eggs, sauteed tomatoes and 1/2 avocado

\- 12 cherries

\- 1 nectarine

\- couple of strawberries

\- blended 200g spinach, 1/2 avocado, 1.5 bananas (was a small banana so I added another half), handful of blueberries, pear, water 

\- 2 cups coffee with oat milk 

\- 5 pieces sliced mango

\- a tangerine

\- an apple 

I'm starting to realise that my diet is mostly fruit, which is probably wrong but it feels so right. Should I just stop worrying that I'm doing something wrong or just accept that I love fruit and my body seems to want it more than other foods?",nutrition,1560805460,00RitaMac00,1,1,True,2019-06-17

If the *overall* 3:6 ratio of ones diet is what really matters, and a large grain fed steak might have a omega 3:6 content of 250mg:2000mg, couldn’t one just ensure to get a healthy amount of omega 3’s from other sources in their diet to balance their overall ratio and not stress too much about eating grain fed beef?

"New scientific study on mitochondrial booster, Urolithin A (UA), shows supplement is safe, bioavailable and has promising mitochondrial, cellular and muscle health benefits for humans.","Science tells us that after the third decade of life, our cells begin to undergo a shift in their metabolism that is a function of both lifestyle choices and simply getting older. The mitochondria, an organelle that acts as the power generator inside of our cells – including muscle cells – start to become less efficient.

This decrease in mitochondrial function leads to a reduction in cellular function, and in the case of the cells in our skeletal muscles, it can eventually lead to the progressive decline in muscle function. 

Following pre-clinical research in animal models that was published in the reputable Nature Medicine journal, scientists have now published the first translation of the science around gut metabolite Urolithin A (UA) in humans (healthy elderly people). This new study published in peer reviewed journal Nature Metabolism shows that UA is safe, bioavailable and it induces a molecular signature of mitochondrial and cellular health. 

How to get UA? Certain foods, such as pomegranates, contain a class of compounds called ellagitannins that undergo a biotransformation into UA by our microbiome. However, this process is not efficient enough to provide adequate levels of Urolithin A through diet alone. In fact, it is estimated that only 1 in 3 people have the right gut bacteria to perform this transformation into Urolithin A and with varying efficiency. For many people, taking a direct UA supplement is likely the only way to benefit from a precise sugar free dose of UA.

Urolithin A (UA) is a natural dietary, microflora-derived metabolite shown to stimulate mitophagy and improve muscle health in old animals and in preclinical models of aging[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-019-0073-4#ref-CR1). Here, we report the results of a first-in-human clinical trial in which we administered UA, either as a single dose or as multiple doses over a 4-week period, to healthy, sedentary elderly individuals. We show that UA has a favourable safety profile (primary outcome). UA was bioavailable in plasma at all doses tested, and 4 weeks of treatment with UA at doses of 500 mg and 1,000 mg modulated plasma acylcarnitines and skeletal muscle mitochondrial gene expression in elderly individuals (secondary outcomes). These observed effects on mitochondrial biomarkers show that UA induces a molecular signature of improved mitochondrial and cellular health following regular oral consumption in humans.",nutrition,1560980397,UrolithinA,5,41,True,2019-06-19

"During fasting, does the body use or NOT use muscle protein for producing glycogen?","I am a bit confused when it comes to fasting, because different books say different things, and all of them seem to have ""sources"".

In particular, the book by Dr. Jason Fung ""The Obesity Code"" he says (emphasis mine):

&gt; Think about the consequences of burning muscle for energy. During long winters, there were many days where no food was available. After the first episode, you would be severely weakened. After several repeated episodes, you would be so weak that you would be unable to hunt or gather food. Humans would never have survived as a species. 

&gt; The better question would be why the human body would store energy as fat if it planned to burn protein instead. **The answer, of course, is that is does not burn muscle in the absence of food. That is only a myth.**

&gt; Starvation mode, as it is popularly known, is the mysterious bogeyman always raised to scare us away from missing even a single meal. This is simply absurd. **Breakdown of muscle tissue happens only at extremely low levels of body fat—approximately 4 percent—which is not something most people need to worry about.** At this point, there is no further body fat to be mobilized for energy, and lean tissue is consumed. The human body has evolved to survive episodic periods of starvation. Fat is stored energy and muscle is functional tissue. Fat is burned first. This situation is akin to storing a huge amount of firewood but deciding to burn your sofa instead. It’s stupid. Why do we assume the human body is so stupid? **The body preserves muscle mass until fat stores become so low that it has no other choice.**

And at the same time I'm reading Lyle McDonald's ""Rapid Fat Loss Handbook"", where he says (again, emphasis mine):

&gt; So let’s say you stop eating anything and look at what happens[...]. Over the first few hours of starvation, blood glucose and insulin levels both drop. This signals the body to break down glycogen (stored carbohydrate) in the liver to release it into the bloodstream. As well, the body starts mobilizing fat from fat cells to use for fuel. After 12-18 hours or so (faster if you exercise), liver glycogen is emptied. At this point blood glucose will drop to low-normal levels and stay there. Blood fatty acids have increased significantly.

&gt; After a day or so, most cells in the body, with a few exceptions, are using fatty acids for fuel. [...]

&gt; There must be a drawback and here it is: the few tissues that require glucose are getting it via gluconeogenesis in the liver. As above, gluconeogenesis occurs from glycerol, lactate, pyruvate and amino acids. **Now, if the person who is starving isn’t eating any protein, where are those amino acids going to have to come from? That’s right, from the protein that is already in the body.** But recall from last chapter that there really isn’t a store of protein in the body, unless you count muscles and organs. **Which means that, during total starvation, the body has to break down protein tissues to provide amino acids to make glucose. The body starts eating its own lean body mass to make glucose to fuel certain tissues. This is bad**.

So who, exactly, is right? Fung's justification makes empirical sense in caveman terms but McDonald's argument also makes sense (at least to me).

[MYTH] Despite popular belief Potassium supplements are not limited by the FDA to only contain 99mg. I was surprised to see even a Harvard Medical School article was wrong about this.,"I have seen so many credible websites/people say that Potassium supplements (mostly pill form) are limited by the FDA to contain 99mg or less. Like this article on Harvard Health publishing - [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-take-a-potassium-supplement](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-i-take-a-potassium-supplement)

&amp;#x200B;

This is a widespread myth. The FDA does not have a limit on potassium supplements. This is stated by the National Institute of Health (NIH). [https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/#en23](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/#en23)  
You could also search the FDA database yourself and you will not find anywhere that the FDA states dietary supplements need to be limited to 99mg or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok then how come so many Potassium supplements seem to have a max dosage of 99mg per pill?  
I believe the confusion comes from a statement the FDA made in 1975 that some Drugs (not supplements) should carry a prescribed warning label on them if they contain more than 99mg of potassium mixed in with the drug. Some studies at the time said drugs containing higher amounts of potassium in them could cause stomach issues.

&amp;#x200B;

With all this being said you can find some potassium pill supplements on the market that do have higher amounts than 99mg. Two larger brands I seen on Amazon that contain more than 99mg of potassium per pill were Pure Encapsulations and Hi-Lyte. You can also search on the NIH dietary supplement database to see if there's any more.

What should I eat to avoid gallbladder issues?,"I am 20 years old. My diet the past year has been absolutely awful. I had a huge lifestyle change where I went from an active lifestyle with a so-so diet to next to zero exercise eating nothing but the worst stuff imaginable: pizza, everything fried, fast food 4-6 times a week, lots of cheez-its, and everything that is covered in fat. I put on about 15lb in the past year.

It's my fault, I knew it was a problem and I kept saying I'd cut it out, but I never did. Slowly over time, I noticed more and more symptoms of indigestion after eating greasy food. Last week, I started getting horrible indigestion, sour stomach, pains in my chest and around my gallbladder, and I spent an hour or so crying and trying not to throw up, I felt like my entire body was poisoned. I stopped for a few days due to still feeling terrible and I had another meal that was fatty and greasy, then it got even worse, I thought I was going to have to get my stomach pumped.

I am going to the doctor for it. But until then I decided I am going to go on a diet where I eat nothing but fruits, vegetables, and carbs. I suffer from IBS, which makes me unable to digest dairy products. I am going to cut all meats that are fatty like red meat and pork to almost none, and instead eat more fish and nuts.

My nutritional style,"What if being healthier didnt have to be difficult?
8 years ago I was 50 to 70 lbs overweight, hypertensive, with a whole host of other issues thrown in. In very poor shape all around. Dying actually (I know we all are, I mean at an alarmingly accelerated pace). I started the exercise mentioned in another post (years of cardio with some strength training recently brought in), and quickly found a steady state physically that has allowed me to not really change my diet to much from those days to now. By that I mean in the types and amounts of food consumed. A wide variety and little restrictions.

 Of course when I started getting the benefits of feeling better in all the ways that kind of exercise brings it did shift somewhat the types of fuel I was using. More fruits and vegetables to go with lots of meats, high carb and lots of snack foods. It took many years to start to reduce sugar, I was still consuming alot of chocolate bars and candy, some pop, and Halloween would just about kill me for a month (I'm saving my kids by eating it myself right?). With that model, my weight went from maybe 230 at my worst down to around 175 lbs. I would flux within maybe a 10-15 lb range, and this is where my body leveled out. Over time the pop pretty much stopped, the excess sugar has dropped drastically, and things felt pretty good. No major changes health wise, but trending up. Or at least more holding death at bay, rather than running straight towards it.

  For the last few years is when things have really started getting good. I had my exercise pretty spot on, but my diet was holding me back in alot of ways easier felt than described. In the same way that working a decade of night shifts, then spending years on a normal schedule will school you quick on the importance of sleep. Through a twisty path I came into a style of intermitant fasting. Or time restricted eating. Or Keto (stretch) Or there may be a few other names for how I go about things because like everything else I do, its disorganized and improvised on the go. For the last year or more Ive stabilized into a usual pattern of most days not eating anything until late afternoon or evening, eating what would be an appropriate amount of calories for my size until bedtime, and trying to consume real good for me food. That usually means I go between 15 and 19 hours a day where my body transitions from a fed to fasted state, enters nutritional ketosis and stays there until I consume more than about 50 grams of carbs. Sometimes I stay in nk for a day, or more by consuming high fat food. Bacon and avocados and the like. I usually suppliment ketones somewhere near the 12 hour mark, when my body is changing to that energy model itself. I would like to have actual data on blood glucose levels etc, but I can feel the transition now easily enough. My digestive system ""relaxes"" and my energy shifts . My weight dropped another 10 lbs and rarely moves more than a few either way now. My joints go ache free (not that I have any issues, but the difference is notable), there's a new energy and alertness, you can look the benefits up for yourself, but most I can attest to. I've even pushed the fast now a few times to over 40 hours without any food. I still drink coffee in that time with abit of cream which probably wrecks the whole thing in some unfair twist (because going 2 days without eating is hard enough without coffee) but it is something I will be rotating in with yet to be determined frequency. I have a family life and it's weird if someone never eats with you, from a social perspective. So when theres something great to eat, I eat it. If my days energy requirements are outside the norm and I need to adjust I go with it. I listen to my body I suppose and try to accommodate. I'm feeling this out, but it feels good.

PE
 I am pretty convinced that for most people, the easiest thing to change with the biggest impact is when you eat. Or more simply, to stop putting food in ones face more often, for long stretches of time. Give your body some time to rest in between all the meals we eat. It's not historically normal for people to have an unlimited supply of food, and to eat all day long, day after day, year after year. That alone might be at the root of much that ails us healthwise today. Exercise and eating well took me a good distance, but alternating between a fed and fasted state far outpaces that in benefits. I've since approached a 3 day fast, and by George there was some magic happening there (look up autogaphy). This morning someone handed me an A&amp;W Sausage and Egger and I put it back without thinking. Wasn't planning on eating, but I went with it and adjusted the day. It doesn't need to be difficult. I've never looked or felt better, which is a benefit I enjoy. The bigger benefits I'm noticing will play out over the longer game. Better quality of sleep. Decreased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, decreased risk of cardiac disease... blah blah blah.... better me now and moving forward. Now step away from the doughnut.

Does cooking remove or denature antinutrients? In the second case soup seems like a good option. You keep the nutrients and avoid the antinutrients.

Then, for the past few days I’ve been at her hometown with her family eating Polish food - consisting of hardly any veg and high fats and meats. Yesterday I had a bbq with them, and somewhat overate - cakes, sausage, meat - the whole shabang.

And now this morning I’ve had the most painful stomach ache I’ve ever had. To the point where I couldn’t straighten my back.

Is there something wrong with me?,"I'm a 22 years old male, studying at the university and I'm 172cm (5'6'') and I currently weight 74,5 kg (164lbs).

In march I had surgery on my knee and since I needed to do a lot of physiotherapy and exercises to recover fast, I told myself: why not use this as an excuse to start working out in general and ""get in shape"" (at the time I was 80kg/176lbs).

Started to clean up my nutrition, eating healthy and do some calisthenics-style exercises at home along with my physiotherapy exercises.

Now I'm coming to the point.

During a normal day I almost never feel hungry, even before I started to ""eat healthy"", a good 50% of the time that I was eating  was because it was ""time for lunch"" or ""time for dinner"" and my family was eating, so I ate.

Even now, that my eating regimen is cleaned up, I rarely feel hungry unless for example I skipped a meal completely.

About a month ago, I started counting my calories and macros and for what I know/have read an adult male should eat around 2000kcal per day. 

It turns out that, even with my 3 good meals (full of veggies and proteins, well balanced from a nutritional point of view - 40/40/20) that I almost feel forced to finish because it's a lot of food, I'm sitting on an average of 1000/1100kcal per day.

Now, for me it is not a problem. I feel like I'm eating a lot, I don't feel hungry and I'm losing weight on a steady pace.

The only doubt I have is if I'm starving myself without knowing and/or there's something wrong with my metabolism (which I always thought it was just slower than the average).

A thought on nutritional supplements,"I'm pretty new to learning about supplements so please forgive me if I say anything naive or incorrect.

So, my thoughts are that in modern life, nutritional supplements are great for supporting the additional strains i.e. constant high stress environments that we put on ourselves.  They're probably also quite useful for filling the deficit that *potentially* exists when it comes to modern farming practices that affect the nutritional composition of our food.  

However, there seems to be this issue that many multivitamins aim for up to 100% of the DRV (in the UK) and I just think it sends out such a bad message that you can eat rubbish and take a supplement.  Admittedly, you do have the problem of bioavailability and nutrients competing for absorption so how much you absorb, we don't know.  Also, these recommended daily amounts are based on pretty old evidence and the whole normal distribution of requirements etc still exists. 

What do you all think? Where do you stand on supplementation?",nutrition,1561194344,teaandcake368,2,4,True,2019-06-22

How does one determine how much oil soaked into fried chicken?,"Fried chicken was made last night. Super simple ingredients: 1lb chicken breast cut into 8 slices. 1/2 cup almond flour. 2 eggs and a splash of half n half scrambled for battering. 7 herbs and spices. Makes two servings. So far the macronutrients are 82g protien, 30g fat, and 4g net carbs.

The chicken nuggets were fried in a half inch of vegetable oil, one minute on each side. It was super tasty!

But what’s bothersome, the chicken soaked up an unknown amount of oil during frying. This guy is not afraid of fat; his budget is 100g per day. But this person likes to track it and know where he stands.

Can anybody provide insight into how much fat is added through the deep frying process?

How is calorie surplus/deficit calculated when the body does not recognize the concept of 24 hours?,"We all know that to gain weight, you need to have a calorie surplus, and to lose weight, a calorie deficit.

My question is explained in this scenario:

* Person A: Has a daily calorie requirement of 2000kcals. Eats 1000kcals a day. For a week, they have a deficit of 7000kcals.

* Person B: Has a daily calorie requirement of 2000kcals. 
    - Eats 2000kcals on the first 3 days.
    - Eats 1000kcals on the 4th day.
    - Does not eat anything on the 5-7 days.

The viability of a good omega-3/omega-6 ratio,"How challenging is it supposed to be to obtain a decent ratio?

That one item can be for instance peanut butter, walnuts, or yesterday I noticed that pepper steak contains quite a lot of it, and just moments ago, I realized that chicken thigh (with skin) got a pretty high amount too.

So, those of you who are satisfied with your omega-3/omega-6 ratio, do you follow a particular diet? Do you steer clear of peanut butter, walnuts and various meat etc. because of the omega-6 factor?

Gorillas follow a high fat diet. Should humans too?,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9311957/

""The macronutrient profile of this diet would be as follows: 2.5% energy as fat, 24.3% protein, 15.8% available carbohydrate, with potentially 57.3% of metabolizable energy from short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) derived from colonic fermentation of fiber""

Although the study concluded that ""Both the nutrient and fiber components of such a diet and the functional capacity of the hominoid colon may have important dietary implications for contemporary human health."" I still wonder about how this could be translated to a human diet.

I'm not pushing any sort of diet, but I don't think humans have a gut capable of this amount of conversion. Some may interpret this study on the importance of fiber for our digestion, but seeing as we currently have poor developed caecum for fermentation, I don't see it that way. I can assume most herbivores have some sort of hindgut fermentation, and this consequently implicates on a high fat diet. Since humans don't, shouldn't we be consuming a high fat diet to begin with?

Jumping a little on the crazier side, some people talk about how we're in a transitional period. Most likely eating high caloric animal products is what allowed humans to spend less energy on their guts and more on their brains. However, there hasn't been enough time for the human body to ""adapt"" to this new diet. We would be sort of in a limbo, where we can't have a proper herbivorous diet, neither a high fat diet, due to our mechanisms of preserving cholesterol.",nutrition,1561330078,lennonpaiva,36,2,True,2019-06-23

"Is it better to weigh the food, or go by the grams of the nutrients?","Hello,  
I'm on a quest to lose weight again, and remembered a time I had previously lost weight by just eating 8 ounces of protein and 8 ounces of veggies every meal.  


I was weighing my food today and I seemed to have forgotten how much meat 8 ounces really was. A freshly cooked roast won't provide me enough for 3 meals, so I took to the indexer of known things, google. I read that an average sedentary male should eat roughly 56 grams of protein a DAY, as where my current consumption is roughly 192 grams of protein per day. Something is really off here, and I'm not sure what's right and what's not.

Maximum absorbable doses of nutrients at one time?,"Hey everybody! I'm curious about your knowledge about maximum absorbable doses by the human body at one time. With this I intend the maximum quantity of nutrient that is efficiently taken by our digestion without being discarded immediatly with urine etc, taken in one time (around one hour window I would say...?). There's not so much information about that online and everything there is, appears very fragmented and distributed amongst different sites.

I'd like to clarify that with ""maximum dose absorbable"" I mean the maximum *we can absorb* and not the limit above which health problems could verify.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll share the first information I encountered: 

* Calcium: \~ 500 mg at one time, quantity after which the intestine downregulates itself and doesn't absorb it (as calcium carbonate and calcium citrate) anymore at the optimal rate. ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3213620](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3213620))

&amp;#x200B;

I think all this is important because of the efficiency of supplementation. If I get a lot of responses I'll compile a table with these limits so that people could consult it, finding compact info.

I don't mean sugars in general, I am talking specifically about fructose.

The excess fructose is pretty bad and one does not need to have fructose malabsorption to experience side effects in the long run.

How do you balance the cultural traditions of food and cooking with nutrition?,"I'm not going to lie - I love to cook. It's a uniquely human sublime - a survival mechanism, social and cultural tool, artform, and economic engine all wrapped into one. I don't live to travel, but when I do getting to know the local cuisine and food traditions is an integral part. Food, for me, delights all the senses and there is a never-ending abundance of flavor and technique evolving around the world. When I was in high school, I'd watch a lot of Anthony Bourdain and grew to understand that food is not just fuel, but something that is seamlessly embedded into the politics and norms of every single society and culture on Earth. 

As an adult now, I spend a lot of my free time cooking. I'm mostly flexitarian, and focus on fresh, whole meals so you won't find me breaking out a deep fryer or wrapping everything in bacon (see: Tasty). However, I like to cook for friends and especially my girlfriend. I might use a little too much butter with my eggs and salt my pasta water heavily, however I try to stay in line with Michael Pollan's mantra: eat food, not too much, mostly plants. 

When I try to read up on nutrition or find ways to optimize my health, the literature is always so disconnected from the sociocultural and political impacts of food. I feel like nutrition, while understandably intense in its scientific approach, has missed the mark when communicating to Americans and I see a lot of people falling solidly into two extremes: food is fuel, and food is fun. However, food is far more nuanced than that, and to be on either side would be to undervalue food as both an instrument of survival and a distinguishable symbol of identity for every culture on the planet. 

Im kind of rambling, however this is mostly a problem unique to the West (America in particular but growing in other parts of the World) and I think we can make significant improvements to our health by acknowledging the consensus on nutrition while at the same time re-engaging with our food and kitchens - it seems like it's hard to have one without the other and there seems to be a strong correlation between strong cuisine identity and health (see: Italy, France, Japan, Korea, etc).",nutrition,1561427780,IPutMyHandOnA_Stove,7,10,True,2019-06-24

"Does anyone know any good guides (especially videos) showing how to cook truly healthy foods, that hopefully don't cost a ton?","So, I've been off-and-on Keto for a while now. My local grocery stopped carrying any sort of low-carb frozen meals about a month ago, and I've finally run out of everything I'd stocked it.

I'm choosing to look at this as a mixed blessing; I was struggling to stay on Keto anyways, and I was spending a *fortune* on that stuff. (in fairness, it was also super easy and most of it was pretty tasty)

Anyways, I bought groceries yesterday, and I found myself falling into old buying habits; ""cheap"" food that I knew would *taste* good, but it in no way healthy.

I *need* to lose weight, and I have a lot of it to lose. I need to start taking some time to cook, preferably as easy as possible. I'll say, I'm not a big fan of chicken, but I know a bodybuilder I used to live with *swore* by baked chicken, instant brown rice, bananas, and *occasionally* rice cakes (best I remember, he advised me against the last one, simply because it was probably something I'd be prone to abuse and overeat).

If there are any podcasts on eating healthy or cooking healthy, I'd definitely appreciate those, too (since I wear headphone all day anyways, may as well take in some useful information).

Also worth noting... I have *zero* talent for cooking. And not a lot of patience for it, either (which is weird, because my mother's a chef and also loves baking; neither me nor my sister ever enjoyed cooking).

Ketogenic Diet: Glucose and Lipid Homeostasis and Inflammation,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure changes in glucose, lipid, and inflammation parameters after transitioning from a baseline diet (BD) to an isocaloric ketogenic diet (KD).

METHODS: Glucose homeostasis, lipid homeostasis, and inflammation were studied in 17 men (BMI: 25-35 kg/m2 ) during 4 weeks of a BD (15% protein, 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat) followed by 4 weeks of an isocaloric KD (15% protein, 5% carbohydrate, 80% fat). Postprandial responses were assessed following mixed-meal tests matched to compositions of the BD (control meal [CM]) and KD (ketogenic meal).

RESULTS: Fasting ketones, glycerol, free fatty acids, glucagon, adiponectin, gastric inhibitory peptide, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein were significantly increased on the KD. Fasting insulin, C-peptides, triglycerides, and fibroblast growth factor 21 were significantly decreased. During the KD, the glucose area under the curve was significantly higher with both test meals, and the insulin area under the curve was significantly higher only for the CM. Analyses of glucose homeostasis suggested that the KD insulin sensitivity decreased during the CM but increased during the ketogenic meal. Insulin-mediated antilipolysis was decreased on the KD regardless of meal type.

CONCLUSIONS: Switching to the KD was associated with increased cholesterol and inflammatory markers, decreased triglycerides, and decreased insulin-mediated antilipolysis. Glucose homeostasis parameters were diet dependent and test meal dependent.

Would seitan still be considered a highly processed food if it is homemade?,"Seitan appears to be a very low-carb and cheap protein source for those who can properly digest gluten. However, some articles are hesitant to encourage its consumption because it is ""highly processed"". I'm aware the seitan in grocery stores is  often loaded with preservatives and sodium, but what about homemade? Ingredients would be the following:

\***Flour**. This is probably the biggest contribution to the claim. But would 100% whole wheat flour be better than regular white flour, or does it come with the same downsides as all processed food? The carbs are irrelevant because they are all but removed during washing. (Flour contains 75grams of carbohydrates, seitan as low as 5)

\***Spices**. If no excessive salt is used it doesn't seem problematic.

\***Water**. Duh. 

This is all. No use of preservatives, processed oil or extreme heating. Still, is the use of whole wheat flour enough to classify seitan as highly processed? And if so, would this negate any potential benefits of consumption?

Increased metabolism or slower metabolism for longevity?,"Was studying about nitrates and how they might lower our metabolism, but that this might be associated with longevity. Is that true?

This is what I found diving more into the subject: The two basic theories are that either the body is like a car, with components that break down over time due to use (The rate of living theory by Raymond Pearl) or the bioenergetics approach, like Ray Peat's, which proposes that a state of high energy/metabolism allows for the constant renewal of the body, contributing to longevity.

10 Weight Loss Tips That Work If Diets Don’t Help Anymore," 

According to the results of studies by scientists from big U.S. Universities, only 1 out of 5 people managed to lose the extra weight that was at least 10% of their body mass. One of the reasons that make losing weight such a hard task is the plateau effect. This is a phenomenon where the weight stops decreasing despite all efforts.

Of course, when there is no progress, people get disappointed and tend to stop leading a healthy lifestyle. However, it is possible to fight the plateau effect.

**Bright Side** has found scientifically proven ways to make the weight decrease even if you are in the plateau phase.

[Subreddit Update] - New discussion post category [Science Required],"A great many of you have indicated to the mods of this sub directly and via general comments in the sub that you'd like to see more serious science based discussions.  We are trying to balance this with the reality that sometimes people have simple / odd / obvious questions too.  The moderators have given some thought this request and have come up with the following;

## New post option

Example post title: ***[Science Required] Do people with an interest in nutrition cite sources regularly?***

Going forward, participation in posts submitted with [Science Required] added to the front of the post title (brackets must be included as shown here) will be restricted.

* **Serious replies only** - *ALL* responses must treat the post just like [Serious] posts commonly utilized around reddit.  Therefore, avoid frivolous, comedic, snark, and other non-science based low effort types of comments.

* **Engage the individual, not the group** - no generalizations of any kind. Avoid comments like ""those people will act like..."", ""that group tends to..."", ""people who do that think...""

* **Back your claims** - All statements, claims, or points of debate in the comments will require sourcing.  Whether they are linked to or quoted, you MUST back any and all comments / claims you make with science.  

* **Be civil** - As with all participation here, the rules of the subreddit apply. Therefore, do not engage disrespectfully or with antagonism towards other participants or other dietary beliefs.  Always use science to counter claims instead of insults. Refer to the rules post at the top of the sub.

* **Truth before tribe** - *You have the power to make these discussions more centered on science.*  Don't upvote comments just because the person appears to be on your 'team'.  Instead, upvote comments that competently and respectfully support their stance.  Downvote those that don't (even if they are on your 'team').  

* **Report violations** - If a comment violates these rules, don't assume the mods are watching. Bring attention to rule issues by using the 'report' link provided below the comment in question.  There are hundreds of thousands of subscribers and less than a half dozen mods so your help is needed.  Never report comments just because you disagree with them or because you feel they are not truthful.  It is up to you to counter claims which you disagree with.

These instructions will be stickied to the top of the comments for these types of posts.

We hope this will help feed the appetites for more in-depth and productive discussion of nutrition science.  As always, shoot us a modmail if you have suggestions for the sub or if you would like to join the mod team by volunteering a little time each day.",nutrition,1557874670,soundeziner,0,6,True,2019-05-14

Nutritional breakfast ideas for people who hate breakfast?,"I hope this is the right place to post this. Looking for advice. I wouldn’t say I hate breakfast as much as I hate the idea of it because I’m not hungry in the morning, and/or I feel nauseous at the thought of eating. Give me breakfast foods any time except before noon! 

I just started a fancy pants new job and -need- the morning fuel, though. So I’m curious if anyone has ideas for breakfast foods that are:

-Easy to make (I am not a morning person)
-Filling for a couple hours (lunch is at noon)
-Contain no dairy (lactose intolerant)

...and of course, tasty! I’ve tried oatmeal; I can barely eat two spoonfuls. Hard boiled eggs seem okay but not filling. Cereal is always tasty but I never buy dairy-free milk because I end up wasting it. Snack bars are bleh to me, not appetizing. Granola is okay but hard to eat while driving. Fruit is good, I’ve been forcing myself to eat that but it’s not filling. 

I hope those doesn’t sound whiny, I’m just frustrated with my picky morning stomach!

Milk: Yay or Nay,"So I run a preschool class and I'm in the process of adjusting our snack menu. Currently, we have milk for a drink 2/4 days/week. The other two are juice and water. 

Canada's new food guide came out and has all but eliminated milk as a food group/choice. So my boss has suggested that we take milk out of our menu as 'no other animal drinks the milk of another animal after it stops nursing'. Which to an extent makes sense to me. 

I mentioned this to my husband and his response was that 'no other animal has figured out how to get milk from another animal'. Which also makes sense. 

Personally, I think milk is a better choice than the fruit juice, and I'm hesitant to switch entirely to water (though the new food guide would support this), 4-year-olds also get bored quickly and water is not their favourite. 

In a six week rotation, 4 weeks are white milk and two are chocolate.

I'm wondering, from a purely nutrition perspective, should I keep milk in my menu? Should I get rid of it? Is there a nutritional benefit for 3.5-5-year-olds to continue to have milk?",nutrition,1557888859,Cdnteacher92,7,4,True,2019-05-14

Of course I am bit more fatigued/tired, but I dont really mind that.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm looking at the aspects of hair health and male hormone T

&amp;#x200B;

reason being I wanted to boost my T and drop some Lbs. via the scale and body fat % I can say I was definitely successful in one and for the other I definitely do feel more vital. 

&amp;#x200B;

nothing crazy or unethical was involved the routine was most all just advice from places like here and just changing up diet and workout lifestyle. I upped my cardio mainly brisk walking and went from aaround 0-2000 steps a day to 8k-10k a day. I did one cardio session fasted and one after a workout. I upped my workout intensity and made sure 80% of my workouts were compound movements with heavier weight and then some accessories. diet wasn't much of a change, read michael pollen back in school and that shit stuck. but I did up the cruciferous veggies, eggs, pumpkin seeds, mushrooms, what not and of course ate at a deficit. 

&amp;#x200B;

now what happened after a few weeks again i'd say i was successful in what i set out to do. but i noticed that my hair on my right temple @ my cowlick has thinned a lot in my mind, i style daily this is noticeable and recent. i'm a dude so of course it could be that time but idk if i kick started something or what the deal is. one thing I am positive about is I'm a terrible nail biter and off hand noticed prior to my hair like these feel even shorter than usual. and i've seen that protein is crucial for hair/nails and I know I lost some muscle and was eating a deficit and upping the intensity so maybe related maybe. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

now for the question sorry for that long intro. 

&amp;#x200B;

again could be so far off here but if any of this is remotely plausible i'm curious. cause foods that i did end up eating more of like pumpkin seeds, eggs, are said to help boost T? but I also see they are helpful for hair health and growth? foods like soy, maybe not the best for male hormones but maybe could be good for  hair? foods like flax are gray area for both.... omega 3 fatty fish good for both? beef is supposed to be good for T but some people say a lot of red meat is bad for hair, and then some say red meat is powerhouse for vitamins all that your hair need. in terms of working out, lower body fat % means less estrogen so more T............. but could more T mean more DHT and more hair issues?",nutrition,1557956413,whatdoido322,1,1,True,2019-05-15

Participants were randomized into two groups: 29,294 (60%) were assigned to a usual diet comparison group, while 19,541 (40%) were placed in a dietary intervention group with the goal of reducing their daily fat intake to 20% of their calories and to increase their intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains.

In the data being presented at ASCO, researchers have found that the women in the reduced-fat diet group saw more health benefits compared to those in the control group. Most notably, the risk of death from any cause after a breast cancer diagnosis was reduced by 15%, and the risk of death directly from breast cancer was reduced by 21%. Throughout the dietary intervention period of 8.5 years, investigators found 8% fewer breast cancer diagnoses overall.

Chlebowski noted that these findings were particularly interesting given that the intervention group did not hit its target goal of reducing fat intake to 20% of total energy, but still managed to see significant benefits while only reducing their intake to 24.5%.”

Missing nutrients..?,"Hey guys, 
I’m new to this sub so forgive me if this breaks any of the rules, but I don’t think it technically does..So basically, I’ve been dealing with dry skin for a while, and this weird thing where my eyebrows fall out. Like they grow, but then at a certain point fall out very easily, they also get visibly dry as well and flaky. My skin doesn’t show as many visible signs as my eyebrows because I wash my face and moisturize, but all this is really doing is masking an actual core issue. Now I said initially that I don’t think this breaks any of the rules because, while this post might come off as me seeking medical advice, it’s not. I’m near positive it’s my diet, which leads me to my question: What could be wrong/missing with my diet that’s causing the dry skin/presumably weak eyebrow follicles? I know for a fact my diet is lacking several things, as I tend to miss out on fruits and vegetables out of forgetfulness, but what specific vitamins and micro/macronutrients are needed to aid or just overall reverse this?

Sugar Free vs All Fruit spreads/preserves,"I’m reintroducing carbs back into my diet after going low carb for a little while.

&amp;#x200B;

Before flagging me for self-promotion this is just a prototype and I make no money off of it. I'm simply trying to see if it's at least useful to the nutrition community who are some of the few who even know what energy density is before possibly turning it into a full-fledged app.  I've been using it for a while to determine what's less dense for things in the same category like nuts, pasta, desserts or oils.

All the broscience surrounding the claim that protein synthesis maxes out at 20-30g of dietary protein is driving me crazy.,"I've been trying to read up on this claim because it seems to be highly relevant if you want to build muscle, and I have no formal knowledge of the subject myself. Does all the ingested protein over 30g go to waste? Should you eat smaller meals more fequently as a result? When you start looking around the internet, you stumble upon countless articles with very strongly worded titles, often along the lines of ""busting the myth"", ""explaining protein synthesis"", or sometimes ""The truth behind ........""

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, the actual contents of these articles is often narrow. They often try tackle some specific aspect of the issue, but very few of them actually adress some of the fundamental questions about how protein absorption &amp; synthesis works. It is like people are trying to dazzle you with fragmented ""high-level"" knowledge to distract from the fact they they dont seem to know the fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, something that is rarely brought up is the temporal aspect of protein absorption &amp; synthesis, even though it seems like something pretty fundamental in this case. The studies that people cite in regards to the 20-30g protein cap seem to have used protein shakes directly after workout, or in one case some form of lean beef. They showed that there was no difference in muscle protein synthesis between the people ingesting 20-30g and those ingesting say, 90g. Now, most of the articles that ive read seem to implicitly look at this as a singular event. Like there is a hatch somewhere in the body that gets opened once all the food is ""processed"" and then everything gets absorbed at once. This seems absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

So fine, you may not need more than 30g of whey protein or some other fast absorbing protein after workout, but what happenes when you eat a full meal with say 50g of protein, complex carbs and other nutrients, in other words, when the body needs to process the food more slowly? Does every gram over 30 still go to waste when it comes to building muscle?  I've heard different numbers when it comes how long it takes for the body to digest food, some say 6-8, others 36 hours, surely that must play some part. How much protein can the body absorb, say, per hour, and how does this impact synthesis?  How long after ingesting it does it begin? How does it vary depending on food?

&amp;#x200B;

None of the articles ive read tackle these fundamental issues in a satisfying way. Maybe some dietician-redditors can shed some light on this?",nutrition,1558108369,VisibleExcitement,75,111,True,2019-05-17

Advice needed with my daily routine,"I need some advice with my diet. I’m trying to lose fat while building muscle. I am a 25 years old male. My body fat is around 19%. I’ve got 94 kgs and 193cm (6’3”).

My daily routine is waking up at 6, going to the gym for 2-4 hours (depends on my mood). I do cardio, HIIT, strength, sauna and swim. That means I workout to consume at least 1000 calories at the gym (sometimes 2000+, but let’s assume 1000 at least). I don’t eat anything before the gym. Although I take vitamins (Athletic Greens) and a shot of energy drink (PHD VMX2) which helps me work out a lot. During the workout I eat a protein bar.

After gym I go back home and make myself a shake containing: 250g fat free yoghurt, 500ml skimmed milk, 10g chia seeds, 10g spirulina, 10g cacao powder, 10g collagen, 30g whey protein and 1 banana. This counts as 71 carbs, 8 fats and 88 proteins.

For lunch and dinner I’m having the same meal. And I try to keep it like this for as much as possible. It is 200g turkey breast, 300g broccoli and 120g pre-cooked rice &amp; quinoa. One meal equals to 56 carbs, 5 fats and 72 proteins. Twice a day. 

I’m counting my calories with My Fitness Pal. My macros are 40% carbs, 40% proteins and 20% fat. Just by eating what I eat daily I am left with 12 carbs, 21 fats (which most likely I’m getting it anyway from searing the turkey in olive oil) and -49 proteins (minus 49). 

However, after I add those 1000+ calories from the gym, I still have carbs fats and proteins left to eat throughout the day, but I decide not to, in order to lose more weight. At the end of the day my calorie deficiency is 1062+.

Could you tell me if I’m doing anything wrong by dieting like this? Am I harming myself? Is everything fine? Is it healthy? I have no degree in nutrition and this meal plan is made after reading some books and mostly Reddit. 

Also, I’m drinking loads of water. At least 4L per day.

Best Fat Loss Meals? What are they based on?,"Often people ask me questions like:

- What meals should I eat to get ripped?

- Can I eat this meal or that meal?

- Is pasta bad? 

- Will eating hamburger and pizza ruin my gains?

My answer to these kind of questions is always that there is no meal that is somehow magically better than another.

What’s important is that most of the meals a person choose to eat supports long-term fat loss and muscle growth. That’s it.

One of the biggest reason people struggle to get in shape is because they choose to follow restrictive diets. Some people fall for the low carb high fat diet. While others do the opposite and eat only high carbs and very low fat.

Other people force themselves to eat only the “cleanest” foods that they can find. Meaning they will allow for absolutely no junk whatsoever.

But it’s been shown repeatedly that restrictive dieting is not a good approach to take, especially not in the long-term.

To successfully build a lean and muscular body your diet must apply to two things, which are:

1. Your physiological needs

2. Your psychological needs

One without the other won’t cut it. In order to be successful both of these needs must be met.

To do this make sure that your meals are based on these 5 things:

1. Balanced macronutrients
2. Good taste
3. Satiating
4. Health promoting
5. Simple to make

I've found that by making sure that your meals are based around these five things you will see super easy and enjoyable fat loss.

I have coffee or iced coffee every morning (to be exact, I start drinking it around 9:00 am and I’m done by noon-2:00ish) and I figured there must be some science behind coffee holding you over for a while so I stopped drinking coffee on days where I don’t open at work, but my appetite still hasn’t been kicking in until the evening. In addition to this, I usually work out or hike in the afternoon.

I was miss-diagnosed, since x-Ray is nutritious to be a difficult tool for diagnosing one of these bones and was put on a cast today.   


I'm going to a dietician in a few days.

I did a blood test a few days ago and the data found that I'm only lacking in WBC &amp; Iron, sadly I'm cheating on my ""let's be healthy as we're going ethic""-diet, I know that eating meat could help, I asked the doctor three times if to take calcium and was answered twice that I should take ""a dose of chicken"", I took it very lightly and am even considering it for this period of recovery, as I'm writing these lines. But I request other (vegan) forms of help or to the least: an explanation why I should consider more heavily to eat: \_\_\_\_\_ or \_\_\_\_\_\_ (Cow, Chicken, eggs, Tuna). But there's no room for ethics discussion here and I will not start or show support of it in this subreddit.  


I'm looking for food that is either easy to make (Being 1.5 handed &amp; all) or may be eaten ""from the shelf"" \[like washed fruits and vegs --that I need to consume more--, nuts, bread with some paste (Like: Hummus, PB, Pesto, Tahini, etc')\], I'm also disappointed by my legume consumption, which as a vegan is a very red flag. Keep in mind that I'll get professional personal help in a few days so don't bother writing as much as you read (:P).

Lack of Information for most nutrition biases,"Why is it that most people who propose a diet for x and y only do so based on biased evidence or for reasons that don't actually include the nutrition aspect OR jump in without fully researching it themselves and expect it to work out for them in the long run.  


Say for example WFPB, lots of people do it for either ethical reasons or health reasons, but when it comes to the later it seems most don't actually research enough the downsides of such a diet or what other people have actually experienced with the diet, studies and the interactions certain things within the diet will have (nutrient uptake/bioavailability and what not).   


The point I'm trying to make and not to bash WFPB in any manner, is that people tend to jump on these things without second guess (from my perspective) either to fix health issues or other reasons and don't seem to fully understand what works and what doesn't or don't really care for the information and see themselves as bettering society or themselves through the way they eat. I see posts on here constantly about ""x didn't work for me"" or ""I've been on y for this period of time, suddenly I've got issues on bones or heart or my CAC went up or LDL has shot through the roof"" and these are things that have happened multiple times before but that people can literally take a few seconds to look up.   


I fully understand there's no diet that fits everyone, but I feel like people should be a little more open minded to understanding what they're eating down to the nutritional and anti-nutritional aspects of the food before fully saying ""hey this is good for me"" because often times you might not realize it was bad for you until it was too late.",nutrition,1558366207,Lavasd,31,1,True,2019-05-20

The ULTIMATE tl;dr GUIDE on getting ZINC from FOOD or supplements,"Perhaps 95% of people have zinc deficiency. It can cause hair loss,  insomnia, low testosterone, loss of sense of smell, bad skin, depression.

Its nearly impossible to get zinc from food. All the Google results you see for 'how to get zinc in your diet' are trash.

Considered one of the best dietary sources of Zinc - because they are - Pumpkin seeds still are a terrible source of zinc. You would need to eat 200g of pumpkin seeds - 1000 calories worth - to get 15mg of zinc you need. https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3067/2

Additionally, if you ate this it would be 40g of Omega 6 fats and 0.3g of Omega 3. Now omega6 from plants are not like the ones from meats - they are healthy. But I still would not do this without a lot of research and consultation with experts. Also if you are eating  1500 Calories a day then you have only 500 left to get all your vitamins and micronutrients as pumpkin seeds are only good for Vitamin K.

Lets assume we arent going to eat 1000 calories of pumpkin seed a day for the rest of our lives. 

Except oysters.

**Oysters are perhaps the only Zinc source from food that can work.**

Fresh and tinned oysters have ultra high zinc. Assume getting 1 fresh oyster every day is too inconvenient.  So consider buying a bunch of tinned oysters.

An 85g tin has 6 days worth of zinc(!). And it costs £2.50. So thats 50p a day. An acceptable price to pay if you think you have a zinc deficiency.

HOWEVER you cant load up on zinc. Your body does not absorb it or store it like it does with e.g. iron. If you consume a huge amount of zinc you wont absorb it all. So you need to portion out the oysters over a week. 

However one tin lasts 3 days after opening. So you might need an oyster buddy. You should each eat 1/6th of the tin every day, then on day 4 open a new tin.

After considering the cost and inconvenience of the oysters **I have opted to take a supplement** of Zinc Picolinate. 3 months of zinc was £7, compared to the oysters where £7 bought me 2.5 weeks of zinc. Its around 5x cheaper. 

I *really* wanted to get everything from food, but it wasn't meant to be. 

Other (organic) zinc supplements are probably as good. I chose picolinate after reading reports on the nootropics subreddit about the different types of zinc supplements. The other 4 worth taking are listed on the examine page https://examine.com/supplements/zinc/ . 

Be sure to take oysters/zinc supplement WITH a food but with a food LOW in Magnesium, Iron or Calcium. No milk, no steak! If you consume it with the other metals then they compete to be absorbed and you will be wasting the zinc.",nutrition,1558376939,CHAD_J_THUNDERCOCK,5,0,True,2019-05-20

partially rehdrated dried tomatoes, sun flower oil, chili, cane sugar (less than 3% of total product), basil, wine vinegar, salt, garlic powder, black pepper, thyme, acidity regulators

Is this an unhealthy product that's best to be avoided due to that less than 3% of total sugar?

97% wholegrain wheat, raw sugar, salt, barley malt extract, vitamins and minerals

Is this then an unhealthy food due to that few percent of raw sugar? Should I avoid buying this product, to make a political decision of not supporting products/companies that put sugar into every food item?

I work with bees so I have lots of raw honey on hand. Is it silly to go out of my way to eat cereal that has no cane sugar added to it, to then put some honey on my spoon to eat with the cereal?

I like making tofu battered and fried in coconut oil. The batter I've been using, has a small amount of processed wheat. Is this then unhealthy because of the processed wheat used? Would it be a lot better if I learned a way to make the fried tofu with non-processed wheat?

I like eating out at Vietnamese restraunts. They always serve me either processed noodles, or processed white rice. I'd imagine they add sugar to their sauces as well. Even though they have lots of vegetables, is this not that healthy then?

I've looked in many stores and cannot find any vegetable stock, nor any oyster sauce that doesn't have sugar added to them. Should I then not cook oyster sauce stir fries anymore? Should I not make soups with bought vegetable stock? If I haven't made any vegetable stock days before, should I just make my soups using water instead of stock, to avoid that approximately 2% added sugar?

I'm pretty unsure how to evaluate it. Feedback appreciated.",nutrition,1558538228,StickyMeans,46,2,True,2019-05-22
Vegan Keto Diet vs Vegan High Carb,"My GF and I are vegan and interested in experimenting with both philosophies and document the effects to provide a vlog about what happens to our bodies on either approach to determine the optimal lifestyle.

  
A lot of people say there are benefits to the physical and mental benefits of  Keto, but we are already pretty skinny so we are not really concerned with fat loss. Also being Vegan keto you are limited to just seeds nuts vegetables and coconut, no fruit.  


I'm leaning toward high carb because it's including more fruit in the diet and I know that glycogen is important to fuel the muscles for exercise.

"Three consecutive weeks of nutritional ketosis has no effect on cognitive function, sleep, and mood compared with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet in healthy individuals: a randomized, crossover, controlled trial.","A ketogenic diet did not improve mental performance like so many claim.

“OBJECTIVE: Because there are concerns about the association between high-fat diets and cognitive decline, this study aimed to determine the effects of a KD compared with an isocaloric high-carbohydrate, low-fat (HCLF) diet on cognitive function, sleep, and mood in healthy, normal-weight individuals.

METHODS: Eleven healthy, normal-weight participants (mean age: 30 ± 9 y) completed this randomized, controlled, crossover study. Participants followed 2 isocaloric diets-an HCLF diet (55% carbohydrate, 20% fat, and 25% protein) and a KD (15% carbohydrate, 60% fat, and 25% protein)-in a randomized order for a minimum of 3 wk, with a 1-wk washout period between diets. Measures of β-hydroxybutyrate confirmed that all participants were in a state of nutritional ketosis during post-KD assessments (baseline: 0.2 ± 0.2 mmol/L; KD: 1.0 ± 0.5 mmol/L; washout: 0.2 ± 0.1 mmol/L; and HCLF: 0.3 ± 0.2 mmol/L). Cognitive function was assessed using a validated, psychological computer-based test battery before and after each diet. Subjective measures of mood and sleep were also monitored throughout the study using validated scales.

RESULTS: Three weeks of sustained nutritional ketosis, compared with the HCLF diet, had no effect on speed and accuracy responses in tasks designed to measure vigilance (speed: P = 0.39, Cohen's d = 0.26; accuracy: P = 0.99, Cohen's d = 0.04), visual learning and memory (speed: P = 0.99, Cohen's d = 0.04; accuracy: P = 0.99, Cohen's d = 0.03), working memory (speed: P = 0.62, Cohen's d = 0.26; accuracy: P = 0.98, Cohen's d = 0.07), and executive function (speed: P = 0.60, Cohen's d = 0.31; accuracy: P = 0.90, Cohen's d = 0.19). Likewise, mood, sleep quality, and morning vigilance did not differ (P &gt; 0.05) between the dietary interventions.

Mix a teaspoon of nutritional yeast into a can of spinach and you have almost your entire vitamins+minerals for the day.,"I've noticed that if you combine 5g of nutritional yeast with a can of spinach that it covers nearly every single vitamin and mineral in about 100 calories. Spinach has all the Vitamin A,C,K,Calcium, Magnesium. And nutritional yeast has all the B vitamins, zinc. You are supposed to have the yeast with food. And it would give the spinach a nutty/cheese flavour to make it more interesting. They complement each other perfectly.

You still would be missing 60% of vitamin E, all your Vitamin D (hard to get from food - but sardines will work), 40% of your zinc and iron and B2, 33% your magnesium and Phosphorus, Potassium and Copper. Though you can use 2 teaspoons of yeast flakes to solve half of that. However you cant really get much more iron/calcium/zinc/magnesium from this meal anyway as your body can only absorb 700mg of those at once and you are reaching that limit with this meal.

But if you eat this you are pretty much covered since you have another 1900 calories left to get the 10% of things still left. This should fit into any diet. In fact despite being totally carbs this is even keto compliant - as leafy greens at or below 5% of total calories is allowed. It will work with ultra-low calorie diets like 500 calorie OMAD. It will work with putting on muscle while losing fat (when you need to eat 150g in 1500 calories, which is tough).


Both things store for a long time and take minimal preparation. It costs less than £1. Its also 40% of your fibre. Microwave it or sautee it in butter with garlic and lemon or cumin and garam masla. Then sprinkle yeast flakes at end.

One 460g can (2 cups) of spinach (£0.80):

* 600% of Vitamin A
* 100% Vitamin C
* 2500% Vitamin K
* 40% Vitamin E
* 68% folate (B9)
* 40% Calcium
* 40% iron
* 66% Magnesium

5g Nutritional yeast (£10/450*5= £0.11):

* 200% B1
* 64% B2
* 107% B3
* 121% B6
* 110% Folic Acid (B9)
* 88% B12
* 20% biotin B7
* 117% B5

"Persistent hunger pangs eventually triggering food binges, can't break this cycle.","Hello Reddit.  I have struggled with binge-eating for about the past 16 years at least.  As a result over the years I've also become proficient in most things fitness and generally being able to manipulate my weight with relative ease.  As of late my new thing has been endurance events, I started with shorter distances (5/10Ks) and have now finished my first full marathon a few weeks ago.  I'm currently in a recovery / rest period with a lower volume of training so to compensate for the decreased calorie expenditure I just increased the volume of my resistance (currently follow RR from r/bodyweightfitness), and have also added in some body-weight leg exercises.  So in a day I'll generally eat something like: 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 0445 run (most everyday)

\&gt; 32 oz water &amp; 20 oz coffee

\&gt; Breakfast: oatmeal w/ pb, banana &amp; honey &amp; soft boiled egg

\&gt; Lunch: cup quinoa cooked with grilled chicken or tuna

\&gt; RR body-weight routine (2X week)

\&gt; Dinner: fish|chicken with rice|sweet potato &amp; roasted veggies

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* depending on my hunger through out the day I will keep a jar of pumpkin seeds, almonds, macadamias and raisins with me for the occasional handful to curb my hunger pangs. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I use MyFitnessPal to ensure I'm getting the right amount of calories to support my training / lifestyle.  However I will say I do not generally enter my vegetables in as they are mostly a negligible amount of calories.  I do however enter the fats I cook them in either avocado or olive oil. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is some background of where I am coming from, so the problem I am currently experiencing is that I will have persistent hunger pangs at different times of the day but especially after dinner.  Example, last night I had dinner which was grilled chicken, baked potato, roasted brussels sprouts, it was a fairly large plate which left me very satiated afterward for about 30ish minutes before starting to feel burning hunger pangs again.  So I had a half banana with peanut butter and some water then we went to bed.  About two hours into my sleep 2230 PM I wake up with the same nagging burning hunger pangs so I go to the kitchen.  At this point I was obviously very tired and this affected my food choice which turned into a 'binge'.  I ate: 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 2 banana walnut muffins both with peanut butter &amp; jelly

\&gt; a few pieced of a milk chocolate hazelnut bar  

\&gt; handful of larabar bites

\&gt; peanut butter and jelly blondies (frozen treat from trader joe's)

\&gt; and at least a few glasses of almond milk with some PB&amp;J scoops between. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say I felt defeated and down on myself after this. From experience I have done best with generally balanced meals (my definition is including protein, carbs &amp; fat in each meal) and if I can help it try to avoid snacking.  Looking at what I have provided here what might you recommend for me to adjust my eating habits so I do not constantly have these hunger pangs?  Also do you think the increased load of resistance training is a factor here?  If so how can I / should I adjust my diet differently to avoid this same cycle?  Thank you.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

Currently very frustrated with myself as constant hunger pangs are leading to binges and taking an emotional toll.  I'm a runner in a sort of off season, I've increased my resistance training load, thinking perhaps this could be a factor? What advice can you give me to help avoid this cycle going forward?

Preventable Cancer Burden Associated with Poor Diet in the United States,"“Results
An estimated 80110 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 76316-83657) new cancer cases were attributable to suboptimal diet, accounting for 5.2% (95% UI: 5.0%-5.5%) of all new cancer cases in 2015. Of these, 67488 (95% UI: 63583-70978) and 4.4% (95% UI: 4.2%-4.6%) were attributable to direct associations; and 12589 (95% UI: 12156-13038) and 0.82% (95% UI: 0.79%-0.85%) to obesity-mediated associations. By cancer type, colorectal cancer had the highest number and proportion of diet-related cases (52225, 38.3%). By diet, low consumption of whole grains (27763, 1.8%) and dairy products (17692, 1.2%) and high intake of processed meats (14524, 1.0%) contributed to the highest burden. Men, middle-aged (45-64 years), and racial/ethnic minorities (non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and others) had the highest proportion of diet-associated cancer burden than other age, sex, race/ethnicity groups.
Conclusion
More than 80,000 new cancer cases are estimated to be associated with suboptimal diet among US adults in 2015, with middle-aged men and racial/ethnic minorities experiencing the largest proportion of diet-associated cancer burden in the US.”

What to do?,"I really want to drop 30-50 lbs and get stronger on my bicycle, but not sure what approach to take.

I am currently 5’7 and 212 lbs.  A year and a half ago I was almost 230, but with a plant based diet I managed to drop 17 or 18 pounds.  However, on the diet i was definitely in a major calorie deficit and I’m not sure i was getting as much protein as i should have (my fault)

I had some medical issues last year (unrelated to diet) and spend time in the hospital and out of work, I fell out of the loop with my health and I stopped eating plant based and rose back up to 217-219.  As of lately I’ve been logging food and paying attention to my habits, that has helped me go from 219-212.  I would however like to hit 160-180 lbs.  

I noticed through my logging, I often eat over my fat goal of 50-70g, sometimes as much as 100-120g.  I also never eat much more than 100g of protein, i feel 150-200g would be optimal for my size and build, my carbs are sometimes under goal unless i drink alcohol, which also puts my calories way over goal.

These habits make me feel like i should get back on the plant based diet, which will naturally reduce my fat and caloric intake, and if i pay close attention i can up my protein take through beans, grains, mock meat, shakes, etc

Or i should give keto a try and by cutting out carbs i should naturally up my protein intake and will be eating more fats through meats, cheeses, nuts, etc.

How can anyone consume 100grams of fiber a day?," [https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/ideal-ratio-protein-fiber-12235.html](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/ideal-ratio-protein-fiber-12235.html) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to build muscle for a little bit now and I've done a fair amount of research into the protein intake and the balance of other macros and what not. From what I've gathered, since I'm a 76 kg I'd need to consume about 169g of protein a day and so that's what I've been doing. However, the issue comes up when I have to digest that much food.

&amp;#x200B;

After eating all that protein, the next morning I'd be crapping out stools the size of baby pellets (if I'm lucky) or just straight up diarrhea. My friend suggested that maybe its because of my fiber intake and I guess that makes sense. But based on what this website says about the required amount of fiber per gram of protein, and how less fiber a single Avocado (reportedly the richest source of soluble fiber) has, I'm not sure I'll ever reach the amount of fiber I need (which should be around a 100grams of fiber based on my calculations). Do I really need that much fiber everyday or did I misunderstand the information presented to me? Or maybe you consider this article a hoax altogether?

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I should mention is that I could have lactose intolerance **tendencies\*** and I consume two scoops of protein powder a day. 

\[**\*By tendencies** I mean it only acts up when I eat a whole medium cheese burst pizza alone for example lol otherwise I can drink 4-5 glasses of milk no problem\]

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR :***

*- How much fiber do I really need everyday if I'm consuming 169g of protein?*

Is there a minimum dietary fat requirement for humans?,"**Not** talking about government/WHO/ guidelines or recommendations/averages etc


Obviously we need fat to absorb vitamins A, D, E and K, but from my amateur knowledge - if you have an inadequate intake of dietary fat, your body can convert carbohydrates into fat through lipo-denovo-genisis - would this allow fat soluble vitamins to be absorbed or is this only a storage mechanism? 


Apart from the essential fatty acids; does dietary fat have any other role in the body that can't be met through adequate calorie intake? 


Let's take a very low fat diet, for example. Less than 10g a day, EFA's are met through high vegetable/fruit intake and the odd portion of low-fat seafood like pollock or prawns, and calories are adequate. Since there are small amounts of fatty acids in basically everything - is that enough for fat soluble vitamin absorption? Is there a gram amount for how much fat is needed to properly absorb these vitamins? 



When your body can literally make fats, is there any grounds for claims that you need ""healthy"" fats in your diet at all? That it improves hair, skin, vitality etc or helps with hormone production?

 

Sure, fat is needed for all of above but can't the body make fats?

"How I Lose 18 kilos of fat eating cheap. My personal experience with fruits, veggies and weight loss.","Hello friend, I know how it feels not to love your body and feel ashamed at the beach. That's is actually the problem. We have to love ourselves first, then our bodies can change. It's been a long 10 years journey for me but if you learn from my mistakes you can go way faster. It may seems that you are taking away most of the fun in your life but trust me that is what a drug addict will also think. You know you life will be way better without alcohol for example, you don't need to give it up now, but if you decide to do it, you will gradually move to that new reality, you lose interest and find, tea, juices and smoothies more fun, you will be naturally high on fruits.

People will say it's about sports, I'll say for me it's been 10% sports.

This is my intuitive nutrition journey:

\- I took processed food out out the diet, white flour and sugar. No bread no pasta, nothing from the supermarket with strange ingredients and artificial lab stuff. Only local markets and organic food.

\- Flexi pescetarian diet with clear results.

\- I had a depressive time, lots of cheese and fat and I went up to 80 kilos.

\- I had a vegetarian housemate very friendly and healthy, after that I read a book and the logic of veganism made a lot of sense for me but didn't wanted to give up meat.

\- I gave up coffee and strong alcohols like spirits

\- After getting intoxicated a couple a times I became flexi Vegetarian for one year. I ate lots of fruits and vegetables and I lost like 10 kilos within a year. The most important is what you put in your empty stomach first thing in the morning.

\- Then I started to find animal food smelly and disgusting, so I stopped eating it and decide to become vegan. And I have been the last 7 years with incredible results. People often think I'm 10 years younger. I based my nutrition in The book The China Study at that time. I gradually quit most of the alcohol.

\- The last year I tried Keto vegan and fasting, I lost a bit of fat but after a while I felt weak and low energy. I don't recommend this diet not also fasting.

\- The very best result I had currently is with a flexi raw vegan (low fat diet with many raw vegetables, leafy greens). I decided to quit alcohol 100%

\- I start the day with a smoothie in an empty stomach: Cucumber, celery and parsley. Lots of fruits it's been always so good for me.

\- I follow Jared Leto who is a great master of body change.

\- Since I found MEDICAL MEDIUM my life journey it's been so much clear and easy. I lost 4 kilos the last 3 months with some sport (3-4 hours a week) and eating lots of fruits and salads (just a bit of steam vegetables, no much grains or cereals, not nuts)

\- I'm 62.3 kilos now. In the future I would like to increase my arms but I'm happy with my athletic look.

My body is not perfect and probably it will never be or maybe it is perfect and it always was. I believe we are not our bodies, when we start to understand we are something bigger than our limited ego we can finally love ourselves unconditionally and stop judging us or invalidating our journey.

I’m learning everyday that life is about the journey and not the destination.

How to add color in to your diet?,"  

Given the typical choices available in markets, which vegetables should you eat to obtain the widest range of [healthy](https://healthbeautysecrets.info/) vitamins, nutrients, and fiber?

""My response is simple: eat all of the colors of the rainbow,"" says Dr. Michelle Hauser, a clinical fellow in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a certified chef and nutrition educator. ""These colors signal the presence of diverse phytochemicals and phytonutrients.""

Phytochemicals and phytonutrients are beneficial substances produced by plants. People who eat diets rich in phytonutrients have lower rates of heart disease and cancer—the two leading causes of death in the United States. As an added bonus, vegetables provide fiber, which helps prevent constipation and helps keep cholesterol in check.

**1. Purple/Blue**

**Kale:** Kale has dark green leaves, Dr. Hauser says, but many varieties have purple ribs (with green leaves), are completely purple, or are just very dark green. ""Some of the very dark green varieties have a lot of the phytochemicals that produce purple hues,"" Dr. Hauser says. ""It's just that the green pigments overpower the purple ones.""

· **Nutritional profile.** One cup of kale provides all of your daily need for [vitamin A](https://healthbeautysecrets.info/5-steps-to-get-more-vitamin-a/), C, and K. Kale is also a good source of calcium and potassium. Calcium helps to preserve bone strength and potassium aids blood pressure control.

· **Other vegetables in this group.** A number of vegetables come in purple or blue varieties, such as eggplant, cauliflower, turnips, potatoes, cabbage, asparagus, and carrots.

**2. Green**

**Swiss chard:** Swiss chard is among the many green vegetables rich in the phyto-chemicals sulforaphane, isocyanate, and indoles. The ribs in chard are usually another bright color—like red, yellow, or even multiple colors—so you get the benefits of the phyto-nutrients associated with those colors as well.

· **Nutritional profile.** One cup of cooked Swiss chard provides all of your daily needs for vitamin A and K, and half of your daily vitamin C. It is also rich in magnesium and is a good source of iron, potassium, calcium, and fiber.

· **Other vegetables in this group.** Other vegetables that come in green varieties include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, bok choy, broccoli rabe (also known as rappini), salad greens, sprouts, and collard or turnip greens.

**3. Orange/Yellow**

**Sweet Potatoes:** Orange and yellow fruits and vegetables get their color from the antioxidants alpha- and beta-carotene.

· **Nutritional profile.** One medium baked sweet potato provides all the vitamin A you need daily. It also provides significant amounts of vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, iron, and potassium. In fact, sweet potatoes are richer than bananas in potassium, which helps to keep blood pressure under  
 control if you have hypertension.

· **Other vegetables in this group.** Other vegetables that come in orange or yellow varieties include carrots, yellow and orange peppers, and many varieties of squash and pumpkins.

**4. Red**

**Tomatoes:** The chief phytonutrient in tomatoes is lycopene,  
 the pigment found in abundance in red, orange, and yellow fruits and vegetables. The science isn't clear yet whether the health benefits of tomatoes come mostly from lycopene or from their full range of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.

· **Nutritional profile.** One cup of cooked tomatoes provides nearly all of your daily vitamin C and 25% of your vitamin A. Tomatoes are a good source of potassium and iron.

· **Other vegetables in this group.** Other vegetables that come in red varieties include beets, red peppers, radishes, radicchio, red onions, and red lettuces.

**5. White/Light Green**

**Parsnip:** Parsnip, a root vegetable, is widely available and has a richer complement of nutrients than onions—the white/light green vegetable consumed in abundance in the American diet. White fruits and vegetables contain compounds called flavonoids, such as quercetin, kaempferol and anthoxanthins, which have a range of healthful properties.

· **Nutritional profile.** One cup of parsnips provides about a quarter of your daily fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K. They also deliver potassium, magnesium, and vitamin E and B, as well as calcium and other minerals.

· **Other vegetables in this group.** Other vegetables that come in white varieties include garlic, onions, leeks, -celery, -asparagus, kohlrabi, radishes, Napa cabbage, squash, fennel, and turnips.",nutrition,1558854344,Janos22,9,9,True,2019-05-26

More research is needed before making blanket statements about what people should and shouldn't eat.,"My siblings and I grew up with a single Mom who was a vegetarian.

I never realised that I was part Native American from my Dad's side and all I ever craved was meat.

But I was constantly fed plant food by my Mom; growing up I acted borderline autistic and my stomach constantly hurt. 

I was indoctrinated with the mainstream Canadian food guide and the high carb mindset. ""People eat way more protein than they actually NEED.""

It wasn't until I moved out on my own at age 17, and made my own money, and started buying and eating what I instinctively craved (Palaeolithic nutrition), that my symptoms went away, and my health dramatically improved. My brain health and emotions stabilised and my life radically changed for the better.

I worked at a gym where our manager was of Iranian heritage. He was big into the mainstream high carb diet, and did extremely well eating that way. I looked up to him and tried eating the way he did, and every time, I would get sick again. My hypothesis is that his ancestors in the Mesopotamia region have been eating the foods from agriculture for thousands of years, as opposed to my own ancestors who are of Northern European and northern Native American heritage, who didn't start eating grains and carbs until a few hundred years ago at best. 

There is evidence to suggest that Indigenous populations are more prone to diabetes and metabolic stress from high carb diets. I have a gal pal who is Native American, and she gets regular seizures; she is heavily indoctrinated by totalitarian veganism in spite of overwhelming evidence showing ketogenic diets reduce seizures.

I know for me personally, I metabolise fat and protein better than most people. My brain and body feel best when I eat grass fed meat, seaweed, medicinal herbs and spices, berries, wild rice, bone broth soup, among other things. 

I know much of this story is anecdotal, but I strongly believe further research is needed into the genetics of diet before making blanket statements about what people should and shouldn't eat, about what macros people need and don't need, and more respect needs to be placed on listening to our instincts; ""What does my body want, that nature created?""

I know that palaeolithic nutrition is not popular from an environmental perspective, but it there is strong evidence to suggest that regenerative agriculture, rotational grazing(mimicking the ancient buffalo) reduces drought and desertification(See Alan Savourys Tedtalk), builds soil. Ecosystem based farming is more sustainable than irrigated GMO monocrops. 

Some celebrity's do extremely well with certain diets, and then promote that to everyone in fad books. Some people do extremely well with veganism, others do not. Some people do well eating a plant based diet for a couple weeks in the middle of the summer. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some people do great eating like an Eskimo.

Can I overdose with transdermal supplements? (mainly magnesium),[removed],nutrition,1555122454,lennonpaiva,1,1,True,2019-04-12
Can people overdose on transdermal supplementation? Like magnesium or vitamin D,"Okay, so technically this is a Nutrient related question, so I think I'm in the right place.

I heard transdermal supplementation of magnesium, although harder to determine how much you're getting, as you can't count how much you're absorbing, is better since you don't have to deal with bioavalibility issues in the gut. My question is, can one overdose on it transdermal? Because although we can forcefully ingest a lot of supplements , we can't force the skin to keep absorbing it. It also seems safer, as the body would only absorb what It needs.

I don't plan on megadosing it, but since it is really hard to measure how much I'm actually getting, I'm afraid that it might accidentally happen. So what's the deal? Would my body know when to stop absorbing it (which makes the most sense to me) or do I risk overdosing?

(Before anyone says about getting it through food, I know it's better and I'm doing my best to get it, but due to soil depletion, bioavalibility, etc I'm not sure how much I'm actually getting and would like to supplement once or twice just for precaution).",nutrition,1555123142,lennonpaiva,3,2,True,2019-04-12

Should I be worried about moldy nuts?,"I want to switch from potato chips to nuts as a healthier option but I've read about nuts having aflatoxins which are not clearly visible which worries me. I tried some roasted and flavored nuts and with those it's harder to spot or taste anything off.

I could not find any info on how bad eating a moldy nut is exactly aside from it being carcinogenic where there is a wide spectrum of danger. Is it like eating a strip of bacon? Smoking a cigarette? Or getting a CT scan?

Do I need to be fussy and carefully inspect each nut before eating it? Should I only buy unsalted, unroasted nuts? Do I need to make sure they are from a certain country?

My Weight Loss Journey + Nutrition + Before &amp; After Pics :),"I started my weight loss journey after gaining a lot of weight while finishing high school and starting college.

I gained close to 60 pounds in 2 years. For years I tried so many ways to restrict calories or not eat desserts or junk food and I would lose 5 pounds and plateau. I discovered Keto and within two weeks my energy, sleep, and stamina improved.

I started Keto in September of 2018 and as of now I have lost 50 pounds!! I started CrossFit in December and love how eating ketogenic gives me the energy to complete the workouts.

What Are the Biggest Reasons Diets Fail?,"The average American dieter makes 4-6 dieting attempts per year. Clearly that means the first… and second… and third attempts weren’t successful. It’s a vicious circle of demotivation that leaves many feeling like they cannot succeed without superhuman tenacity.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you are ready to throw in the (oversized) towel on dieting for good.

&amp;#x200B;

Don’t be. Take a minute to look at the four reasons why most diets fail, and then find a diet plan that bypasses these pitfalls. Soon you will find yourself on track to optimal success.

&amp;#x200B;

*Let’s look at the four key factors.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Unrealistic Calorie Intakes**

&amp;#x200B;

The “starvation mode” method only sets you up to fail. By consuming so little food, your body literally starts shutting down to conserve fuel.

When this happens, you are on a one-way path to a fat loss plateau. Yes, you should lower calorie intake to see fat loss results, but you need to do it in a way that maintains your “metabolic engine.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Lack Of Satiety-Boosting Nutrients**

&amp;#x200B;

Another big issue with most conventional diets is they fail to provide enough of the two most filling nutrients: protein and fiber. You need protein to function optimally. It also breaks down the slowest, providing the body with lasting satiety.

Couple protein with dietary fiber, found in fresh fruits and vegetables, and digestion will slow even further.

Many crash diet plans are very low in protein. While they recommend lots of vegetables, many discourage the consumption of fruit.

By making these two nutrients a focus of your plan instead, you can see faster, lasting results while actually enjoying your diet meal plan.

&amp;#x200B;

**Time Consuming Meal Prep**

Who has an hour each and every day to meal prep? Not me — and definitely not you. Yet, many diet plans are complicated enough to require this. If that describes your diet, it’s no wonder if you’re failing.

Alternatively, you want to find an approach that gives you basic and easy-to-implement guidelines that help you realize true success with your program.

This plan should not require hours of extra effort each week. In that case, it’s stealing free time that you should use to reward yourself for good behavior. It should work with your lifestyle, not against it. When you find such a plan, it’ll be cakewalk to stick with it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Long-Term Approach**

Chances are you’ve heard that any diet plan you use should follow a long-term approach.

That’s excellent advice.

However, if your diet plan is designed to span months, this can be a motivation killer.

Find a diet with a definite deadline. Two weeks is optimal because that’s how long it takes to form long-term habits. Two weeks is also long enough to see good results, but not short enough to stay motivated.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone willing to lose weight can diet for two weeks. This is foundational to The 2 Week Diet. In many, many cases, the initial transformation is so remarkable, it provides abundant motivation for continued fat burning. Success breeds success.

Lifelong Digestive Issues That Just Won’t Resolve,"So I’ll try to quickly give a bit of history here.  I’m 34 now.  I can’t poop if I don’t do both of these things - take psyllium husk every day and do not eat any meat (which is a shitty way to live because I love meat.  Also I do a lot of weightlifting and need protein.)

When I was young, I pooped once a week, thought it was normal, and eventually ended up having lots of blood come out of me when I was 15.   Doctor explained fiber, but gave me Benefiber (insoluble fiber), which did nothing.   Did my own research and found the wonders of psyllium husk (soluble fiber).  which I blend into my daily smoothies with tons of veggies.  Problem somewhat solved.  

Now, it’s getting worse again.  My alternative health doctor explained to me that my digestion and gut microbiome are directly related to my mental health (lifelong depression, insomnia, and anxiety).   I always knew that I got my anxiety and my constipation from my mom and that those two things are directly related. 

My doctor has been telling me that it could be more of a mineral deficiency problem caused by poor intestinal health (certain minerals and nutrients not being absorbed properly).  She suggested sending a sample of my hair for a mineral analysis, which, upon further research, seems like it might be bullshit.  

She also told me that the loads of dead skin in my ears is due to poor digestion/absorption.  

So where do I go from here?  I’m thinking I’ll try an elimination diet, with gluten being the first thing I eliminate.  I’m also trying probiotics, just one strain at a time.  L. Reuteri and L. Rhamnosus are the two I’ve been experimenting with, as these two appear to have some benefits for sleep and anxiety.  Other supplements I’ve been working into my regimen are digestive enzymes and enteric coated peppermint oil.  

So any other advice here?   I just want to stop struggling on the bowl pooping every few days and to get my digestion in order, and I KNOW that other benefits will follow.

Can Keto supplement pills help with weight loss without the Keto diet?,"Hi! Okay so I know my question sounds dumb, but I am genuinely curious.

My eating habits right now aren’t that bad actually. I eat fruits (not a lot of veggies I’ll be honest) and have good portion control. I also don’t snack that much because I drink a lot of water all day.

Sinple question about calories in chicken that I can't seem to find an answer too,"Ok so I've done some ""research"" and pretty much everything I see online says that a baked chicken breast (boneless and skinless) should have about 165 calories per 100g. That seems to be the standard I see online

However, when I look at the packing of the chicken breasts (boneless and skinless) we buy, it says that oven baked, they should be 137 calories per 100g

Now most other stores give their weights as raw, which specifically when it comes to meats, I find annoying to use, but that's beside the point. But the one other store that lists calories for baked chicken on the package, also has a number around 137 per 100g

So...what's right? 

I've been dieting for a while and yes I've been fairly consistently losing, and we eat a lot of chicken, so I know ultimately if I've been undercounting, its clearly not a huge deal, but, I'm anal about these things and this is making me anxious and annoyed

Both salads are equally delicious if you add a hard boiled egg, for extra protein.

"does eating large amounts of vegetables (or any food) ""stretch"" your stomach, causing you to require bigger portions in order to feel full?","is this a personal situation? probably, and so maybe it will be removed. I have taken some nutrition classes and, as most of us do, I \*know\* what i am supposed to eat and how i am supposed to do it. but do I do it? no. I have a problem with binge eating. I mindlessly eat out of control, it makes me feel better. recently ive been making meals that my roommate says are too large but that consist mostly of veggies and protein. I say to my roommate that for arguments sake let's say that i am incapable of eating small meals, that when I have dinner or come home from work at 1 am my choice is either 2000 calories of ice cream, chips, and cookies or large servings of cauliflower rice with some beans and such.

he says that eating too much is going to stretch my stomach out, which is going to perpetuate my problem of requiring more to make me feel full. first of all, ""feeling full"" doesn't mean much to me anyway, I am going to eat whether or not I am full. I say it does not matter if what I am eating is low in calories (and decent in nutrition). for me personally, even if he is correct i see it as a non issue because as i said it is a choice between a pint or two of ice cream or multiple servings of cauliflower rice...... and its not like i am making myself sick on veggies. but putting my personal issue aside, is he correct?",nutrition,1555449217,lickMikeHunt4luck,8,7,True,2019-04-16

Taking Vitamins Doesn't Seem To Lower Mortality Risk,"Thought this was interesting and relevant to a lot of questions I see asked here. It might raise some new questions. Like the  utility of lycopene supplements. 

Link to the actual paper in the link below. 

In summary:

&gt; Most dietary supplements don't appear to provide a mortality benefit, according to an Annals of Internal Medicine study.
Researchers studied 31,000 U.S. adults who answered survey questions about their supplement intake in the past 30 days and about their diet over the past 24 hours. During a median 6 years' follow-up, 12% died.
&gt; Supplementation for most vitamins and minerals was associated with lower all-cause mortality, but after adjustment for education and lifestyle factors, the associations for all but lycopene disappeared.
&gt; Adequate intake of vitamin K and magnesium was tied to lower mortality risk, but this was restricted to intake from food. Excess calcium intake was actually associated with a 62% higher cancer mortality risk, which the researchers attribute to high-dose supplements.

&gt; They conclude: ""The evidence suggests that adequate nutrient intake from foods was associated with reduced mortality and excess intake from supplements could be harmful.""

Too much spinach? Am I harming myself?,"Howdy

I’ve been a very picky eater my whole life (AFRID, avoidant food restrictive intake disorder) and I’ve been trying to branch out at my own pace. I figure if I’m eating a tight range of foods, if I can make that healthier choices instead of pure junk like I have my whole life I’d be far better off. I’ve even added more foods than I thought I would but it’s still slow and steady. 

The differences thus far are tremendous!  More energy, less body aches, sleep better, and my mood is far better. I’m shocked at the difference, better than any psychiatric med I’ve tried and no side effects! 

I’ve stated reading about oxalates in spinach. Now I’ve been eating probably 200-400g of baby spinach a week for a couple months now. Always raw since I don’t enjoy it cooked. I’ll put 60-90g in my smoothies and use it as a green in salads. I really like the stuff. Is this going to hurt me some how? My salads have sweet pepper, cheese and tomato and smoothies milk and fruit. I’ve read briefly that vit C and calcium help with it but it’s hard to find anything truly reassuring. I don’t want to hurt myself :).

I   am not allergic to my knowledge.  I had a simple food allergy test a   few years back and my local clinic.  (Idk how reliable that is)   and   gluten was not checked..  Anyway.    I just was enjoying a delicious   Panera bread sandwich with some french onion soup.  Both contain gluten.     Bread for the the sandwich, croutons on the soup.  Got me thinking.    Is there anything unhealthy about there being gluten in this?   I know   that the sandwich and soup may have a little excess sodium or fat,  etc.   But what about the ""gluten"".  Is there anything inherently bad  about it  for healthy individuals with no allergy?  I try to eat healthy  but  there so much fear mongering around gluten.

What's growing in our shaker bottles!? It rhymes with CEE POLI...,"A few years ago, I was in college and frequently found myself in the gym.

What are non-nutritive calories/empty calories?,"I always thought that calories varied in “goodness” based on how healthy they can be, but that ultimately the body is able to metabolize all of them.  Refined sugars and saturated fats are dangerous because they get metabolized too quickly and can go straight to fat, but if the body is engaged in some kind of intense activity, it will grab those calories and use them to fuel it's many cells.

But are there calories that the body can't burn?   And if so, why do we call them calories (which is a measure of the amount of energy the body can extract from a given nutrient)?  I know things like alcohol can be weird, because the body expends energy to metabolize it and un-poison you from the harmful substances you've ingested.

I ask because I'm underweight and I often wonder if eating ""empty calories"" is me just wasting my time (I doubt it, but it still makes me think).

SHE LOST 89 KILOGRAMS IN 18 MONTHS AND CHANGED ONLY ONE THING IN HER DIET," 

The following article is actually an inspiring true story about a young woman with a strong will and dedication. She was obese and at one point in life, she even weighed 150 kilograms. At only 17 she got pregnant which made her problem even bigger. She started eating more and more and gaining more weight. Every doctor she saw told her the same thing. If she continued the pace she wouldn’t live for more than a year. This revelation forced her to take immediate action which changed the entire course of her life.

She knew she had to fight for her life and decided to change her entire life upside down. The main problem was the junk food she ate constantly. She started eating healthy, home cooked meals and gave up the junk food entirely. She eliminated chips and sodas and turned to healthy snacks which made her feel full and energized. In only 18 months she managed to go from 150 to 60 kilograms by only eliminating processed food with high sugar amounts and carbs. She lost 90 kilograms in less than 18 months with strong will and dedication.

Best Vegetables Diet Plan for Kidney Patients | Kidney Treatment By Puneet Dhawan,"What we consume in our daily lives plays an important role in maintaining the [\#health](https://youtu.be/PSlbGCQdR5Y) of our [\#kidney](https://youtu.be/PSlbGCQdR5Y). There is a direct link between a diet and the health of your kidney. As #[kidneys](https://youtu.be/PSlbGCQdR5Y) are responsible for excreting out toxins from your body, if you burden your kidney with heavy nutrients that are difficult to process, your kidney is bound to get affected. A kidney-friendly diet usually includes limiting sodium and potassium to 2,000 mg per day and [\#phosphorus](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23phosphorus) to 1,000 mg per day.  Hence, vegetables that are rich in sodium, phosphorus, and potassium should be avoided by the patient. Such vegetables include 

 • Tomato: [\#Tomatoes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Tomatoes) are raw fruits that are used in vegetables or eaten raw in [\#salads](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23salads). This high-potassium fruit is not fit for a renal diet and hence should not be consumed by a [\#kidney\_patient](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kidney_patient). In a single cup of tomato sauce, you have 900 mg of potassium. 

 • Leafy vegetables: Leafy green vegetables are a source of many nutrients and the most vital being the [\#potassium](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23potassium). While the vegetables shrink to a small size when cooked but the potassium content remains the same. For instance, spinach, beet greens, should be consumed in limited quantity by the [\#kidney\_patients](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23kidney_patients). 

  • Bitter gourd: Mostly [\#diabetes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23diabetes) patients eat bitter gourd to maintain the blood glucose level in the blood. However, kidney patients should not include this vegetable in their [\#diet](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23diet) as consuming this food creates an enzyme in your body that can damage your kidney. 

 • Eggplant: Eggplant increases the chances of having kidney stones that is why doctors suggest patient to eat this vegetable in a low quantity. Eggplant is also rich in sodium, a kind of nutrient that can burden the kidney.  Vegetables that a kidney patient can eat 

 • Radish: This vegetable is a good source of vitamin C, and you will find phosphorus and potassium in low quantity in radish. The [\#antioxidants](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23antioxidants) in the radish can make your heart and kidney health.  

 • Garlic: [\#Garlic](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Garlic) helps to maintain your cholesterol and prevent swelling from occurring due to fluid retention. If you are on dialysis, then this herb acts as a great substitute for salt.  

• Cauliflower: The phytochemicals present in the cauliflower improves the health of your heart. 

• Bell pepper: If you want to eat something that is low in potassium then this vegetable is a good option for you.",nutrition,1555765321,sky67167864,2,1,True,2019-04-20

Is it more likely that the increase in prostate cancer associated to milk consumption is due to the animal protein and not the IGF-1 in the milk?

How Seafood Oil Will Help You Slim Down,"&amp;#x200B;

**Seafood oil** can already assist in preventing cancer of the breast and cancer of the colon; however, we are able to count weight reduction as the second advantage of the most popular supplement.

According to a different study released within the journal Scientific Reviews, seafood oil may also help with getting rid of body fat stores, especially round the belly.

The research that was carried out on rodents, learned that with the help of seafood oil supplements, the topics acquired considerably less weight and body fat, as well as burned more calories, because of a rise in brown body fat.

That increase, the scientists believe, happens because seafood oil may really result in turning whitened body fat (the body fat which directly adds to weight problems) into brown body fat, basically burning through more calories within the length of each day. And beige body fat, a recently discovered body fat cell which was contained in the research, works similarly such as the brown cells.

“We understood from previous research that seafood oil has tremendous health advantages, including preventing body fat accumulation,” states study senior author Teruo Kawada, inside a pr release. “We examined whether seafood oil and a rise in beige cells might be related.”

As the results can’t be directly converted to humans, this news still remains positive.

&amp;#x200B;

“A small amount \[1,000 to 2,000 mg each day\] from the ingredients Environmental protection agency and DHA \[the elements present in seafood oil\] happen to be recommended to lose weight because they might increase satiety with a bit, Inch states Mark Moyad, MD, Miles per hour, author from the Supplement Guide, but does warn the supplement does cause some adverse responses.

“Seafood oil comes with unwanted effects, including stomachache, elevated easy bleeding or bruising, fishy aftertaste, itchiness and breakouts, and adverse bloodstream sugar and LDL changes,” he creates. “You might want to have fun with dosages to locate an amount where unwanted effects are tolerable or removed.”

Even though the research might be developing concerning the weight reduction results of seafood oil, another together with your popular supplement may be sufficient cause to fill up.

How to have a food intervention for someone with an unhealthy diet,"My uncle (Who is basically like a father figure to me) decided to go vegetarian about 6 months ago to lose weight and lower his cholesterol. The problem is that he doesn't subscribe to a plant based diet, he just eats junk. He doesn't really eat that many vegetables and the healthiest he will get is a processed veggie burger with lettuce and tomato. Other than that it's just heaping bowls of pasta, pizza (Except on days where he decides he's no longer eating dairy/cheese), Cheese sandwiches with hummus, chips, candy and snacks. 

  
He binges constantly because nothing he eats comes with a high amount of satiety. He doesn't typically eat breakfast or lunch due to a busy job and consumes his entire days worth of calories through various simple carbs and beer (That's the Wisconsin in us) at night. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love him to death but he is very stubborn and claims ""it works for him"" because he has lost 3 lbs over 6 months. Meals turn into fights as he randomly decides what he is or isn't eating, and his frustrations with himself manifest themselves as him getting frustrated with others. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is not avoiding meat for any scientific/environmental/or morale reason. Just a whim that he has gotten into his head. I'd like to introduce him to a balanced healthy diet, but he is very stubborn and I'm not sure how to even do this. I think if there was a really convincing podcast/netflix show about the dangers of loading up on simple carbs nonstop, and the need for balanced macros it would be helpful. Also any thoughts on how to have this type of conversation would be extremely helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help him so bad and help him feel good, lose weight, have more energy, but having that initial break through is difficult. I feel like his taste buds are warped as is his ideas on what constitutes a healthy diet. His wife (My aunt) would make him any food/meal to help but he has to take the first step.

I am a healthy eater, but find that watching salt intake can be a burden, as the better your food tastes, the more salt you wrack up. It's cruel in a way!

But, this study concluded that:

""an estimated sodium intake between 3 g per day and 6 g per day was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events than was either a higher or lower estimated level of intake.""

This implies that the American health recommendations, a range from 1,500 - 2,300mgs could possibly be too low for healthy eaters.

For example, how does the body process a cup of brown rice (~50g carbs) compared to two apples (~50g carbs).

Petition for Accurate Calorie Labels,"Hello! 

This is my first time posting on reddit, and I wanted to share a petition to improve calorie accuracy on food labels. I recently lost 30 pounds by using a calorie counting app and have found it to be effective, but I always wonder if the label is correct or not after watching the Casey Neistat Vlog about calorie accuracy. The FDA currently allows a 20% percent margin of error in either direction, and I think this should be improved, so I made a quick [change.org](https://change.org) petition and wanted to share it. If it gains momentum, great! If not, at least I tried. I think it's important as counting calories might be the thing that finally improves my health and keeps my weight from yo-yo'ing due to brute force exercise to lose weight instead of a more nutritional lifestyle change.

Insulin promotes fatty acid synthesis and fat storage in tissues - shouldn't high insulin sensitivity predispose to fatty liver / ischemic heart disease (from lipotoxicity)?,"Insulin is an anabolic hormone, promoting both muscle growth and fat accumulation. Insulin resistance seen in Type 2 Diabetes typically creates two problems:

1. Reduced insulin signalling decreases glucose uptake into cells, resulting in energy (ATP) deficiency / mitochondrial dysfunction. Although fat is an alternative energy source, some cells (neurons / rapidly dividing cells [blood vessels]) highly prefer glucose.

2. Excessive extracellular glucose is cytotoxic, inducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Lower insulin signalling would predispose to excessive extracellular glucose.

However, let's assume the opposite situation: High insulin sensitivity (assuming equal sensitivity in all tissues). In this case, cells get all their required glucose, and the blood glucose is normal. It seems great, on surface - however, since insulin also promotes fatty acid synthesis, won't it also promote fatty liver?

In a state of high insulin sensitivity, it should require less insulin to bind to its receptors on hepatic (liver) cells, and activate transcription factors resulting in fat accumulation. It doesn't seem to be specific to the liver, as the cardiovascular system is also known to be significantly damaged from fat accumulation.

what is keto means? Is it real health?,"A keto or ketogenic diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that can help you burn fat more effectively. It has many benefits for weight loss, health and performance, as shown in over 50 [studies.It](https://studies.It)’s also used and recommended by many doctors.A keto diet can be especially useful for losing excess body fat without hunger. 

keto also is a risk

A ketogenic diet has numerous risks. Top of the list: it's high in saturated fat. McManus recommends that you keep saturated fats to no more than 7% of your daily calories because of the link to heart disease. And indeed, the keto diet is associated with an increase in ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, which is also linked to heart disease.

Other potential keto risks include these:

Nutrient deficiency. ""If you're not eating a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, and grains, you may be at risk for deficiencies in micronutrients, including selenium, magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamins B and C,"" McManus says.

Liver problems. With so much fat to metabolize, the diet could make any existing liver conditions worse.

Kidney problems. The kidneys help metabolize protein, and McManus says the keto diet may overload them. (The current recommended intake for protein averages 46 grams per day for women, and 56 grams for men).

Constipation. The keto diet is low in fibrous foods like grains and legumes.

Fuzzy thinking and mood swings. ""The brain needs sugar from healthy carbohydrates to function. Low-carb diets may cause confusion and irritability,"" McManus says.

Those risks add up — so make sure that you talk to a doctor and a registered dietitian before ever attempting a ketogenic diet.

Are simple carbs more fatening since theyre digested quicker (if you dont use the calories in the time it digests?)

While if i eat the same amount of calories of brown rice that take more time to digest, i have more time to use the calories so if it takes 2h30 to digest and i burn 150 cal an hour i would have use the full amount of calories from it so it wont become fat.

is it okay to eat 3-4 protein bars a week?,"Hi everyone. First post here so sorry if this is a dumb question.

I've heard protein bars are actually bad for you, hence my following question.

I'm looking to build/develop more muscle and slightly improve my diet. My diet isn't bad, I just want to cut down on certain things. So my question is essentially this: if I have a decent diet that is relatively low in sugar and has a normal/healthy amount of protein from meats, is there anything wrong with eating a few protein bars each week? I know protein bars have fat and added sugars, but I don't plan on eating them every day.

The ones I like are the Clif cool mint chocolate. They have 20g of sugar, 5g of fat, and 10g of protein. If I eat, say, 3-4 of these per week (after my workouts) but have a healthy diet otherwise, are the protein bars still bad? ",nutrition,1552508132,ElephantsRTasty,1,1,True,2019-03-13
Should micronutrient intake increase based on weight?,If an average person needs to take in 5 grams of potassium does someone twice the weight require 6? Or some other number bigger than 5?

Forks Over Knives,"I watched the documentary film Forks Over Knives on Netflix and I noticed a few interesting things:

1. They always say plant based not vegan when they made claims.

2. They are proponents (at least on their website) of an extremely low fat diet which excludes even the healthier oils.

3. They said all animal products are always harmful.

4. They claim animal protein turns on cancer and vegetables turn off cancer.


I realize they probably say super low fat to keep the omega 3 and omega 6 levels balanced in people who don’t eat fish. Am I correct in that? The reason the Mediterranean diet allows olive oil is because the high levels of omega 3s from fish create a nice balance with the other kinds of fat. The Forks Over Knives diet seems pretty miserable and impractical. No fats? That’s gonna lead to a gnarly swing later on of overindulgence. No animal products? Can you imagine waking up every day and turning down anything with animal products or high in fat or even avocados? In the long run is the FOK diet really better than a standard diet of whole foods which incorporates animal products such as eggs and yogurt? Why should we be avoiding fat so much? Any other information that should be taken into account as far as their claims go? I’m a pretty healthy person who is active and eats well so my intention is really to figure out the validity of these claims. Thank you for your time!

Vitamin A accuracy: Cronometer vs. Nutritiondata vs. Wikipedia,"According to Cronometer, 100 grams of raw carrot got 16706 IU of vitamin A (16706 IU * 0.3 = 5011.8 micrograms of retinol equivalents). The percentage bar suggests that that equals 557% of RDA (5011.8 / 5.57 = ~900 mcg retinol equivalents = RDA), meaning ~18 g carrot contain 100% of RDA. Other sources, like Nutritiondata.com, suggest that 100 g of the same got 16705 IU, but that this equals 334% (an often referenced estimate) of RDA (it's not until now I noticed that the IU - as opposed to the percentage of RDA - estimates of the two sources actually correspond). Then there is the Wikipedia article about carrots, according to which 100 g carrot got 835 micrograms of Vitamin A equivalents, which supposedly is 104% of RDA.

So far, I haven't found any sources which got a percentage of RDA estimate higher than that suggested by Cronometer, but I don't know whether this means the latter's number is exaggerated. There is something similar going on in the case of lettuce too. 

Anyway, how would you go about determining what to trust regarding this?

"How my wife and I do our version of 'BlueApron', but cheaper and from local grocery stores","This was [a reply that I made previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/azyrq3/how_i_felt_using_those_meal_delivery/eibigwi/), but it was mostly ignored.  I thought I would share here as well in case anyone else finds it useful.  


Basically, my wife and I are doing a BlueApron/HomeChef meal planning, but we're doing it with a couple of apps.  The best part about it is that we're not shipping food across the country, we're buying it from our local grocery stores -- yet still having it delivered to our house.

&amp;#x200B;

It involves two apps (note: I am not affiliated with either of these apps)

* [Mealime](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealime-meal-plans-recipes/id1079999103?mt=8)  — this is a great recipe app; it allows you to schedule your meals,  filter recipes on your personal food preferences -- you can specify low carb, keto, paleo, vegetarian, flexitarian, etc -- you can even list ingredients you don't like or are allergic to.  The recipes are all high quality, beautifully photographed, and easy to read.  Most importantly, it lets you  upload your shopping list to Instacart, which brings me to the second  app.
* [Instacart](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacart/id545599256?mt=8) — order groceries from local grocery stores and *have them delivered the same day*.   So, instead of picking out meals and shipping your groceries from  across the country, you’re just ordering from stores you probably  already shop.  I believe there’s either a delivery fee, or you can sign  up for $99/year (in which case any order over $35 is free).  Either way, it’s probably cheaper than any of the home  chef options out there.  


So, when we plan our meals for the week, it all goes into Instacart.  Then we take out the stuff we have already, and hit the order button.  It usually arrives at our door in an hour or two.  Much cheaper, more convenient, and quicker than other meal prep services.

I tried One meal a day for 30 days," 

Hey people, i have actually seen many people referring to fasting as an insanely good fat reduction tool, so i went ahead and tried OMAD (one meal a day) for 30 days.

If you dont want spoilers about the results yet then here is the video :

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYh7ietVNGw

If u dont want to watch though thats cool so keep reading for results and stuff.

Basically during the 30 days i noticed hunger going away day by day with its peak during nighttime which to be honest wasnt that bad either. But i would feel a more intense hunger after 1-2 hours have passed since my workout, and the more intense it was, the more hunger i felt pretty much. I used a balanced approach between calisthenics and weights for my workouts which would last around 1- 1:30 hours average, less energy overall but still manageable , the bad part about it was that my legs felt tired even after days of not training them so i actually felt my legs getting hard-taxed by the fasting. 

Every single day i tried to reach as close as possible my calorie maintenance level with that one meal plus a protein shake. 

Results:

i was at 80.3 kg ( which i dont remember how many pounds that is but i wrote it in the video anyway), 11% body fat , 43,35% lean muscle mass, with a BMR of 1804 calories, so what happened is that i dropped 3 kgs down to 77.3kg, 9.2% body fat, 44,10% lean muscle mass and my metabolism almost didnt change with just a 17 calorie drop to 1787. In exact numbers: lost 1.6kg of fat, and 700g of muscle which to be seems like an ok trade ( eventhough am not sure how much those number differ in other cases and with other ways so i cant really tell)

"Overall, dietary changes could explain 57% of the total structural variation in gut microbiota whereas changes in genetics accounted for no more than 12%. This indicates that diet has a dominating role in shaping gut microbiota","Really great roundup of various studies re: microbiome here


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448089/

The influence of diet on the composition of the microbiota has been shown during the initial colonization phase: breast fed infants have higher levels of Bifidobacteria spp. while formula fed infants have higher levels of Bacteroides spp., as well as increased Clostridium coccoides and Lactobacillus spp. [44]. Beyond the postnatal period, the microbiota was suspected to be relatively stable throughout life.

 However, several recent studies have shown that dietary factors alter the microbial community resulting in biological changes to the host (Table 1). In fact, the composition of the gut microbiota strongly correlates with diet as demonstrated by a study assessing the relative contributions of host genetics and diet in shaping the gut microbiota and modulating metabolic syndrome phenotypes in mice. In mice fed a diet high in fat, there are many key gut population changes, such as the absence of gut barrier-protecting Bifidobacteria spp. 

Overall, dietary changes could explain 57% of the total structural variation in gut microbiota whereas changes in genetics accounted for no more than 12% [45]. 

**This indicates that diet has a dominating role in shaping gut microbiota** and changing key populations may transform healthy gut microbiota into a disease-inducing entity. For example, the “Western” diet, which is high in sugar and fat, causes dysbiosis which affects both host GI tract metabolism and immune homeostasis [46]. This was modeled in a humanized mouse model where adult human fecal microbiota was transplanted into GF mice. The mice were fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet and when switched to a “Western” diet, the microbiota composition shifted to an overgrowth of Firmicutes including Clostridium innocuum, Eubacterium dolichum, Catenibacterium mitsuokai and Enterococcus spp., as well as a significant reduction in several Bacteroides spp. [18]. In mice, carbohydrate-reduced diets result in enriched populations of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla, [47] and calorie-restricted diets prevent the growth of Clostridium coccoides, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacteria spp., which are all major butyrate producers required for colonocyte homeostasis [48]. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates show less pathogenic species such as Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and Enterobacteriaceae [49] than diets higher in fat or protein [48,50,51,52]. 

Complex carbohydrates also increase levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria spp. such as B. longum subspecies longum, B. breve and B. thetaiotaomicron [53]. **Refined sugars, on the other hand, mediate the overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria like C. difficile [54] and C. perfringens by increasing bile output** [55].

 Vegetarianism alters intestinal microbiota in humans because high amounts of fiber result in increased short chain fatty acid production by microbes which decrease the intestinal pH. This prevents the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae [56]. 

Interestingly, it has been found that European children have a microbiota depleted of Bacteroidetes and enriched in Enterobacteriaceae compared to rural African children which the authors attributed to low dietary fiber intake by Europeans",nutrition,1552704851,Bluest_waters,65,456,True,2019-03-15

Nutritional substitutes for Fish &amp; Eggs?," 

Hi everybody,

I'm (22 y/o male) allergic to seafood and eggs. To clarify the latter, I can eat eggs that is baked into things (i.e. cakes, cookies, etc.) but cannot eat eggs just by themselves. Very weird.

On top of that, when I was younger I had a major allergic reaction to tilapia and thus underwent testing that ruled I was allergic to most other seafoods. After that ordeal, I just don't feel like playing whack-a-mole to find out what I am or am not allergic to.

So that brings me to the present. Both food groups are not in my life, and over the past 2 years, I've developed small patches of hair loss (alopecia areata) that is relatively contained but still quite annoying and distressing to deal with. My hair has been brittle my whole life, but this condition really only started a short time ago.

I had bloodwork done that ruled out thyroid issues and have no other symptoms of Lupus. I'm thinking the issue may be dietary and/or allergy related.

Since I am unable to eat fish and eggs, what sort of nutrients and vitamins am I missing out on? And what could I substitute to replace them?",nutrition,1552788634,VinoRosso96,1,1,True,2019-03-16

Is switching breakfast from a double double to an instant oatmeal a net positive?,"I am trying to make some small incremental and sustainable changes to my diet. I am doing a post grad and have a baby so energy is limited. I have switched from random sugary snacks to only fruit about a year ago. Switched dinners from processed foods to only meats and veggies.

The last big thing I want to change is my breakfast. For the last 10 years I've only had a McDonald's double double coffee for breakfast with an apple or banana after. I realize now there is a lot more sugar than I thought. I was thinking of switching it with a low sugar instant oatmeal which would be almost as fast and convenient and could still be prepared like a hot drink. I usually use milk for the oatmeal and add a lot more after so its very liquid. 

My question is would this even be a net benefit? I know the instant oatmeal is processed but the one I bought, Quaker instant multigrain, has only 9g of sugar, this would be compared to 34g for the coffee.

I know making proper oatmeal is best I just don't think I have the commitment right now to make it part of my daily routine. I've been trying to kick the coffee for years and its never stuck because I fall back into the routine.",nutrition,1552836279,Juergenator,2,1,True,2019-03-17

"Oryzanol Market to Perceive Exponential Growth at CAGR 13% Driven by Henry Lamotte Oils GmbH, Huadong Medicine Co., Ltd, Kangcare Bioindustry Co, Ltd"," 

The [**Oryzanol Market**](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/oryzanol-market) is estimated to exceed USD 3.5 billion &amp; witness more than 13% CAGR up to 2025. Rising health concerns among young and geriatric population along with increasing awareness regarding LDL cholesterol will drive the oryzanol market growth. Increasing heart related problems due to unhealthy eating habits have propagated the demand for cholesterol control medicines.

Shifting trends towards fitness has created the demand for sport supplements to help in body building among young population. Oryzanol based sport supplements are considered to be highly safe due to its natural extraction from the rice bran oil. No legal limitation over its consumption makes it more popular among athletes.

Request for a sample Copy @ [**https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/3089**](https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/3089)

Pharmaceuticals dominated the overall industry demand and accounts for more than half of the volume share in 2018. Rising heart related diseases due to high occurrence of LDL among population of all age groups has surged the consumption of cholesterol control medicines. As cholesterol doesn't have any specific symptoms which induce the consumer to keep a check on health and take precautionary medicines.

The ingredient is used in anti-aging, skin whitening, and sunblock creams in the cosmetic industry. Rich in antioxidants and scavenging toxicity from the skin has made the product popular in skin care applications. Cosmetic sector is expected to observe more than 12% growth up to 2025 in oryzanol market.

North America oryzanol market is projected to witness over 14% CAGR from 2018 to 2025. High consumer spending along with increasing health awareness programs by the government to control premature deaths from heartache will drive the regional industry growth. It is estimated that in the U.S. over 50% of the adult population take prescribed cholesterol control remedies. The region also has a dominating share in the overall sport nutrition spending and held responsible for more than 40% of the consumption.

Asia Pacific accounted for more than 30% of the overall oryzanol demand in 2018. Raw material accessibility at a large scale coupled with the presence of major manufacturers are among the key factors influencing industry growth. China, India, and Japan are the major contributing countries in the region and together accounted for more than 65% of the demand in 2018.

Nutraceuticals and sport supplement applications will witness the highest growth in the European oryzanol market.

Even now as I'm trying to get as close as possible again, I'm having to consume a very non-trivial amount of whey protein just to avoid the kind of unbearable weakness that I would otherwise experience.

For 3 months I only ate food in capsule format to trick my body into not being hungry and lost 65 lbs. AMA,"(40 food pills per meal x 8 meals = 320 food pills a day)

After reading hundreds of white papers about microbiome, diets, weight loss, etc. A really interesting thing stuck with me.

· When people get older and start to lose the sense of taste, they consistently start to lose weight.

· If someone has surgery on throat and this causes them to lose their sense of taste during healing process, they consistently lose weight.

· If someone takes a medicine that has a side effect of them losing their sense of taste while on it, they consistently lose weight.

This core concept is what led me down this path to create this Food Pill Diet. I theorized if you could get food into your body without tasting it then you could help mitigate hunger. The quick overview is that if you don't taste food and feed yourself 40 food pills every 2 hours (8 times/meals a day) then the hunger hormone ghrelin is kept in check and you can get all your daily recommended vitamins and minerals, be on a 1,000-calorie daily diet, not be hungry and easily lose weight. It worked. I consistently lost 5 lbs every week and just didn't feel hungry.

In this world of meal replacement drinks like Soylent or Huel I'm wondering if other people would do what I did or if it seems too crazy?

Abstract

Background: Questions remain about the strength and shape of the dose-response relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and mortality, and the effects of specific types of fruit and vegetables. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify these associations.

Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched up to 29 September 2016. Prospective studies of fruit and vegetable intake and cardiovascular disease, total cancer and all-cause mortality were included. Summary relative risks (RRs) were calculated using a random effects model, and the mortality burden globally was estimated; 95 studies (142 publications) were included.

Results: For fruits and vegetables combined, the summary RR per 200 g/day was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.90–0.94, I2 = 0%, n = 15] for coronary heart disease, 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76–0.92, I2 = 73%, n = 10) for stroke, 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90–0.95, I2 = 31%, n = 13) for cardiovascular disease, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95–0.99, I2 = 49%, n = 12) for total cancer and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–0.93, I2 = 83%, n = 15) for all-cause mortality. **Similar associations were observed for fruits and vegetables separately. Reductions in risk were observed up to 800 g/day for all outcomes except cancer (600 g/day)**. Inverse associations were observed between the intake of apples and pears, citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and salads and cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and between the intake of green-yellow vegetables and cruciferous vegetables and total cancer risk. **An estimated 5.6 and 7.8 million premature deaths worldwide in 2013 may be attributable to a fruit and vegetable intake below 500 and 800 g/day, respectively**, if the observed associations are causal.

Conclusions: Fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality. These results support public health recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature mortality.",nutrition,1553039634,Bluest_waters,30,41,True,2019-03-19

Breakfast: Steel cut oats, not microwaved.  Pea or Rice protein powder. Either a red apple or an orange, alternate.

Lunch: Steamed rice, Sashimi grade salmon raw, avocado slices.  

Small dinner: 1-2 brazil nuts(selenium), 3 oysters(zinc), boiled Spinach and cooked mushrooms topped with butter(saturated fat).

No condiments except iodized salt and butter.  

Cut out all dairy, all you are going to drink is water and if you need to black coffee, preferably the water should be a high ph water such as Evian or Fiji but this isn't too important, filtered water will suffice.

The idea is this food is fresh, mostly raw and meets most nutrirional needs, its limiting so theres nothing refined except the protein powder, you arent getting anything frozen or farmed except for the farmed salmon. Ideally the fruit and vegetables should be organic but that's not neccesary.

Once you have done this restrictive and inconvenient diet for 2 months just notice how much better you felt and move on to whatever you were on before.  The seafood should not be older than 3 days.

If you only ate food in capsule form could you trick your body into not being hungry?,[removed],nutrition,1553098554,DM4th,2,1,True,2019-03-20
For 3 months I only ate food in capsule format to trick my body into not being hungry and lost 65 lbs. AMA,"(40 food pills per meal x 8 meals = 320 food pills a day)

After reading hundreds of white papers about microbiome, diets, weight loss, etc. A really interesting thing stuck with me.

· When people get older and start to lose the sense of taste, they consistently start to lose weight.

· If someone has surgery on throat and this causes them to lose their sense of taste during healing process, they consistently lose weight.

· If someone takes a medicine that has a side effect of them losing their sense of taste while on it, they consistently lose weight.

This core concept is what led me down this path to create this Food Pill Diet. I theorized if you could get food into your body without tasting it then you could help mitigate hunger. The quick overview is that if you don't taste food and feed yourself 40 food pills every 2 hours (8 times/meals a day) then the hunger hormone ghrelin is kept in check and you can get all your daily recommended vitamins and minerals, be on a 1,000-calorie daily diet, not be hungry and easily lose weight. It worked. I consistently lost 5 lbs every week and just didn't feel hungry.

In this world of meal replacement drinks like Soylent or Huel I'm wondering if other people would do what I did or if it seems too crazy?

Mind you, I really hurt my back, ruptured my L5 S1 disc, and put on a ton of weight by not being able to move much and after a year my doctor ran my blood work and I had high cholesterol (hypertension stage 2), high triglycerides, pre-diabetic, and doctor told me I was heading for early grave so I guess I was really motivated to lose the weight and get healthy again by diet alone seeing I couldn't work out the traditional way.",nutrition,1553100224,DM4th,1,1,True,2019-03-20

Marathon training and nutritional help?,"I am about 6 weeks out from a marathon and I'm starting to focus on my nutrition and health, but I've been talking to a ex-marine and marathon/spartan race guy telling me his routine for his training. Note this is quite brief summary of what he said. Essentially he was telling me he takings a simple whey protein and BCCA's (cleanest ones if possible). The normal diet of his just consisted of primary lean proteins. His consumption of the BCCA's would be half of his serving about an hour before his work out and the rest about midway through. Then the whey protein would be consumed within an hour of the workout.

I am a college student and to be honest it is quite difficult for me to get lean proteins and to the time to prepare them. I've been taking Spiru-Tein(High Protein Energy Meal) and just normal mens one a day multivitamins. I wanted to know about anyone's experience with the BCAA's and if it seems right for me to supplement some BCAA's and whey protein into my diet. I've been researching into the BCAA's and it seems to appear that they essential render useless if I don't have the rest of the amino acids (Histidine, Tryptophan, ect...) I know Spiru-Tein has all of the 9 essential amino acids, but I was curious on adding some more BCAA's. Is there any negative affects? Experiences ect.? Note I guess I would say I am fasting too because I generally eat one actual meal a day for the most part. Meals honestly vary between chicken and veggies to simple cereals. 

Obviously, I would try to get the cleanest products but I would like to know of anyone's prior experience and their findings.  Also any recommendations for whey supplements and BCAA's (if I were to take them). Sorry if this is vague but my research into all of these supplements is quite bare bones but personally what I have been doing has been working but now that my training is starting to pick up more I am just curious one what to focus on in terms of nutritional intake.

Thoughts on oat/rice milk substitutes?,I quit dairy about a year ago due to allergies and I then replaced my regular milk consumption with oat/rice milk alternatives mainly for calcium (which is added in). It wasn't until about a week ago I read about the amount of sugar in them. The rice milk I had been drinking had about 14g sugar/200 ml and the oat milk 6g sugar/200 ml. I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar intake but totally missed the sugar amount in what I drank. On a normal day I was drinking about 1-2 liter which results to 70-140 g sugar for rice milk and 30-60 g sugar in oat milk. Considered this and the low protein and micronutrients it is simpler just to take a calcium supplement (way cheaper to). Because of Soy allergy I can't drink that.

High Volume Foods vs Moderation Programming,"What have you found to be the best approach to dieting in regards to food choices?

&amp;#x200B;

Eating only high volume foods such as egg whites, vegetables, salads, fiber, and similar foods allow me to feel satisfied while consuming a reasonably small number of calories. On the other hand, I've found that this method leads to terrible binge eating when in an uncontrolled environment around calorie-dense foods. This is partially due to a lack of satisfaction with physically smaller meals and partially due to being around foods that I've deprived myself of while dieting.

&amp;#x200B;

This has made me wonder if a better approach would be to eat more typical foods, but program myself to practice moderation during every meal so I do better in situations when I go out to eat or visit family/friends who serve normal foods.

Understanding certain protein food labels.,"When reviewing protein bars I like to avoid soy if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to look at the ingredients list and I know that the ingredients are supposed to be listed in order by the most dominant/most weight of each item in order.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, often I see ingredients grouped together and I feel as though companies may be attempting to mislead people. Here is an example I would like to know the answer to.

&amp;#x200B;

Ex: Ingredients: Protein Blend (Whey protein concentrate, Whey protein isolate), Soy Protein, xxxxxxx

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though companies are grouping together the two more ""popular"" protein sources into a single category as so their combined weight appears to outweigh the individual amount of Soy Protein. But it also leads me to believe that if the concentrate and isolate were not grouped together, that the Soy Protein would actually be the most dominant ingredient. Is this true?

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, does putting items together surronded by ( ) allow you to add their individual item weights together and place them before an ingredient that may have less when grouped by itself?

"Coconut oil worked for incomplete feeling after BM, but only briefly","I have always had that incomplete feeling after a bowel movement, like there is more in the chamber. So I would sit forever on the throne, and it would take forever for all of it to come out. Then I would have to wipe forever to clean up back there.

I started taking 1/2 tablespoon of coconut oil per day. Didn't notice much difference, so I went for 1 tablespoon per day. After doing this for a while, my BM's were great, it felt like they would slide right out, nice and lubricated, and minimal wiping neeeded. I thought to myself: Wow, I can't believe after all these years, all I had to do was take a tablespoon of coconut oil per day!

Unfortunately, this was short lived. I am now back to having the same incomplete feeling with almost every BM. So I started to up the coconut oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons, but this just gives me diarrhea.

A new study out of Harvard shows sugar sweetened drinks can increase chances of mortality by as much as 31%. Artificially sweetened drinks decreased mortality in moderation.,"Another study on the dangers of added sugars. This one looked at the risk of premature death from consuming it. They analyzed over 100,000 people and found even as little as 1-2 sugar sweetened drinks a week could increase chances of mortality.

What was also interesting is they found when sugar sweetened drinks were replaced with artificially sweetened drinks there was actually a decrease in mortality rates. However there was a caveat to this. When artificially sweetened drinks exceeded 4 per day they also noticed an increase in mortality.

Is all dairy equally bad for you?,"Hello, everyone!

I've seen many times on this subreddit people refer to milk as harmful and unnecessary stuff, which is only sold because it is widely supported by dairy lobbying, biased studies, etc. So many folks write about how giving up milk has helped them get rid of acne, reduce bloating, fatigue and feel better overall.

But even if we assume that milk is not necessary for humans to drink on a daily basis (or drink at all, taking into account it's naturally designed to be consumed by calves), then fermented dairy products can be considered some soft of human invention, where good probiotics may theoretically have a positive effect on our health, thereby negating negative consequences of raw milk they are based on. Such products include cottage cheese, yogurt, kefir, etc.

So my question is, should all the controversy surrounding dairy be applied to any product derived from milk, or some of them are better than others? Links to scientific studies diluted with personal experience will be much appreciated.

Is this safe(16M)?," 143 lbs 5’8” and have been going to the gym 4x/wk with occasional stutters for ~6 months. Before that I did swimming. I also supplement with Zinc and use whey before workouts.      

 I want to cut 5 lbs (mostly fat) by saturday April 6th by doing the following and was wondering if 1. It’s possible 2. It’s safe for personal rzns(spring break).       


 My diet is usually egg whites on whole grain, someplace out for lunch like chik fil a or mexican, and something like steak or chicken dinner and this works well to maintain my weight while slowly building muscle and losing fat(it’s for sure a deficit).       


My plan with this program is:     

70 oz+ water throughout day

Mornings: 1.25 cups of chia pudding with fruit on top  (450 calories)      

Lunch: Either carne asada w/ guac and sprinkle of cheese (~600 calories) or chicken thighs with side of mushrooms (similar calories)    

Repeat for Dinner with a protein shake mid-afternoon if it’s a gym day.      

 Will be going to the gym on: Sunday(3/24), Tuesday (3/26), Thursday (3/28), Saturday (3/30), Monday (4/1), (Wednesday 4/3). I already have a workout set up that works for me so I don’t need help with that regard. I also walk my dog ~30 mins every day.

"Insane diet restrictions, need advice.","Hello r/Nutrition fam,

I am a 28 y.o. Hindu (this is relevant) Male living with Ulcerative Colitis and an insane list of allergies. The hindu part is relevant because I did grow up as a vegetarian, until my G.I. Doctor recommended I eat chicken for more protein, I never ate meat. So currently I do eat chicken/eggs but nothing else as far as meat goes. 

My allergies include: spinach, broccoli, cauliflower, cantaloupe, watermelon, garlic, applies, bananas, all nuts other than cashews, coconuts, and pecans, and all shellfish (even though that’s covered in “other meats” anyways).

Recently, I had a gallstone, which apparently at the age of 28 isn’t great, and I’m developing a mind case of NAFL (fatty liver). My doctor said to work out and watch what I eat. I was wondering if anyone here would happen to have any suggestions as far as what I can eat. The UC by itself removes a lot of options due to fiber, or lack of digestion.

With that said, I suppose that insulin spikes and overall blood sugar levels would be another avenue to approach in search of health.

Up untill now I've been on a very simple vegetable and chicken diet, with some milk. I've been having around 200 to 225g of carbs, very little fat and 100g to 120g of protein. my goal is to stay under 2000 claores but lately I've been around 1200 to 1400 as eating chicken and veg has been really taking away the hunger.

Except yesterday and today I've been really struggling with what and how to eat going forward. My very fit mate swears by keto and got me reading all about it. It seems interesting but also very tricky to maintain. 

Atm I have very little fat in my diet, but have been thinking before this to drop back a little on carbs to say 150g per day (pretty easy, I just cut out milk and potato) .. But if I leave fats low then it leaves me with way more protein to get my energy, I can easily have more chicken and eggs a day and feel full I'm just not sure if that's OK. 

What I find easy is cooking up some veg, eggs, and chicken making up some packed meals and leaving them in the fridge. So that when I want to eat it takes 2mins.

Sorry if this isn't coming across clear, I'm very confused atm. And just need some direction on what can I do in terms of carb to protein intake. Or just any advice... ",nutrition,1553426031,Caantpayrent,1,1,True,2019-03-24
Vegan Diet + Oysters = Nutritionally Complete?,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Wanted to ask this question.

&amp;#x200B;

These are the 7 vitamins not found in plant-based foods based on Google's search results:

 

* **Vitamin B12**. **Vitamin B12** is an essential nutrient found in virtually no **plant**foods. ...
* **Creatine**. **Creatine** is a molecule found in animal foods. ...
* **Carnosine**. **Carnosine** is an antioxidant that is concentrated in the muscles and brain (33, 34). ...
* **Cholecalciferol** (**Vitamin D3**) ...
* **Docosahexaenoic Acid** (DHA) ...
* **Heme-iron**. ...
* **Taurine**.

&amp;#x200B;

Vitamin B12 is extremely abundant in oysters (just 1 has 340% DV which means that you can literally eat 3 a week to meet nutritional needs). Vitamin D can also be found in oysters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Creatine, unfortunately, is only found in invertebrates... but is it nutritionally necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

What about the other ones?

Is there any credibility to the concept that consuming fats and carbs separately is more beneficial than in a single meal together?,"I've been reading a lot recently about how consuming carbohydrates and fats together in a single meal is potentially the cause of inflammation and ultimately what's driving 'western' health issues including CVD. 

To combat that, I've read from various sources and nutrition experts like Dr Zoe Harcombe that in an ideal world people would eat fats and carbohydrates in completely separate meals, ideally as far apart as possible. E.g. a meal 90-100% carbs at lunch, and a meal 90-100% fat for dinner.

Here are few other tidbits of info that potentially back this idea:

* The Standard American Diet pretty much always involves meals that are moderate/high in carbs and fats.

* Every other species on the planet only consumes a single type of macro in a meal - even for omnivorous species. Humans are the *only* species that intentionally mix macro types to make up a meal (i.e. have both fats and carbs in a single meal sitting).

* Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) are a thing. Essentially they are produced in the blood when fats and proteins come into contact with sugars. They cause inflammation and ageing. I'm aware that they are also found in foods pre-consumption (mostly animal products), but the main takeaway here is that eating foods high in carbs (sugars) and fats/proteins together increases the risk of high formation of AGEs in the blood. 

* The often-cited Okinawan population diet (as well as several other long lifespan populations) ate high carbohydrate and low fat, and often not in the same meal. Whilst this also suggests high carb/low fat eating may be beneficial for mortality, it also potentially suggests that not mixing macros heavily is beneficial.


So what do you think? Does this concept/WOE have any legs? I'm aware that the Mediterranean Diet to some extent contradicts this.

Thanks

"Out of all of the well known nutrition experts (dead or alive), who do you find the most credible?","Not sure if this is allowed within the rules, but I'll give it a go.

There are lots of established so-called experts and nutrition enthusiasts who have come and gone. Some have been extremely influential, involved in studies and published well known books that have influenced others in the way they view nutrition.

Others, more recently have found an audience through scrutinizing older studies and providing new ways of thinking about nutrition.

There are also those that are firmly in one camp or another - either plant-based advocates who typically (but not always) encourage a higher carb, lower fat plant-based lifestyle.

There are others at the opposite end of the scale who encourage a low carb approach or even carnivorous diet.

Then there are the middle-grounders, ones who encourage a balanced or perhaps Mediterranean-style diet. 

Some may even fall into the category of encouraging a 'fad diet'.

Names off the top of my head who fall into any of these categories - Ancel Keys, Michael Greger, Gary Taubes, John McDougall, Zoe Harcombe, Aseem Malhotra, T. Colin Campbell, Robert Atkins, Jason Fung, Eric Berg, Dean Ornish, Garth Davis etc. There are many more.

So who do you find the most credible? Preferably examples that don't have a heavy ethical-bias and that have credibility based on health, nutrition and science.

Personally, lately I've found Dr Zoe Harcombe to be very interesting and credible. She leans towards lower carb eating, but doesn't exclude carbs completely. I find her discussions on eating carbs and fats separately to be particularly interesting.

So who do you look up to or associate with the most? Preferably with reasoning.

Are there more details to the sugar per day recommended limit?,"The ADA recommends a limit of 25 grams of added sugar per day for women and 38 grams for men.

I frequently see this explained as something similar to ""sugar is digested very fast, causes a spike in insulin."" If that was the reason, wouldn't the amount you can/should have vary based on if you eat it all at once, eat it spread over the day, eat with other foods (I imagine consuming 40g sugar with a giant meal would mean the sugar would take longer to absorb than just the sugar by itself), or eaten with a hypothetical 'shot' of fiber (I hear fruit is fine and not considered 'added sugar' because of the fiber included)?

I've heard the whole - 1 alcoholic drink every day is not as bad as 7 drinks one day each week. Is this not similar?

If the insulin spike isn't the problem, I'm still curious to know if eating the sugar over a period of time or with other food makes a difference.",nutrition,1553463438,Swollen-Ostrich,4,2,True,2019-03-24

Exercise and replacement nutrition,"Let's say a person has an optimal diet - just the right amount (whatever that is), of vitamins, calories, fiber, protein, everything.

Now the person decides to exercise, say it is cardio mostly, 1000 calories worth. (30 bike miles)

What does the person need to add to the already-balanced diet, now?

For instance, there are things that help brain function, skin condition, on and on - the person assumes that just adding exercise, does not increase the need for ALL of the things that were balanced already?

What the person is really wondering is, how much of the 1000 replaced calories can be junk food? I.e., how many Little Debbies does that translate to? Also assume the person is not needing to lose weight.)

The person has never seen it addressed this way.

What one usually hears is, yeah one must have avocado toast, or fruit and nuts.

"I'm thinking of eating the same things for a month, what effect will that have on my body?","I hope this is the right sub. In the month of April I want to eat the thing to try to lose weight. I'm currently very obese (about 270 pounds) and want to try to eat healthier, so I'm trying this out for a month to see how my body will react.

The only thing I will eat the entire month are baked vegetables, a little bit of chicken and some fruit. Here is a list of what I will be eating every day:

Yukon gold Potatoes, Broccoli, Mini Carrots, Steam bag organic Peas, Canned Low sodium chick peas, Steam bag Lima beans, Canned kidney beans, Garlic, String beans, Mushrooms, Red, yellow, green and orange Peppers, White Onion, Celery, About 100 grams of Chicken, Gala Apple, Red Grapes, Whole natural almonds, About 20 grams of peanut butter.

Will this have any negative affects on my body? On one hand I'm afraid it might be too much of one thing, but on the other this may just be an average vegetarian diet, besides the chicken.

Dried fruit - are they necessary for a healthy diet?,"Hello, everyone!
My question is, can dried fruit be considered a healthy food and should they be incorporated in a healthy everyday diet? 
The thing is, I have heard multiple contradictory opinions on dried fruit, ranging from them being a healthy option to calling them sugar bombs in disguise. I believe the main reason lots of people advice to avoid it or at least cut back on them is because they are extremely calorie-dense and  very easy to overeat, when you don't pay attention to how much you put into your mouth. Also, they are high in natural sugars compared to regular fruit, which have water in them. But they also contain fiber and minerals &amp; vitamins, which may somehow negate the negative effects of sugar content.
All in all, if I don't have a sweet tooth and pay attention to eating clean, should dried fruit be an ESSENTIAL part of my diet? Or can I just skip them and eat some normal apples, raisins and bananas instead?

Pregnant - Not sure how to eat. Insight please.,"Hi everyone.

I recently found out I am pregnant. (on my 4th week + 2days)

I am very happy, although I have no idea how many calories to eat for my baby...

I  was eating 1200calories/day to loose weight... (lost 47lbs so far)....   (250cal breakfast/ 500cal lunch and (50 for a snack) 400cal for  supper). I am 5'2, I weight 145lbs.

I  eat ""balanced"" meals with a portion of protein (usually from meats or  beans), carbs (usually veggies and 1 fruit), fibre (one whole wheat  product) and drink lots of tea.

My  snacks are sugar-free fibre drink (knock off brand of Metamucil) between  my breakfast and my lunch (I have an office job), and 1/2 an apple and  1/2 cup of skim milk after work.

I work  out (now with less intensity - because my body is tired) 6 days a  week.... including i go for a 30minute walk during my lunch break monday-friday....

Now it's haunting me that I'm probably not eating enough for my baby and it'll have some really negative effects on my baby's development/health....

I would love to continue loosing weight, but everyone is telling it isin't healthy for my baby...

I just can't figure  out who has the ""best information""... GP or nutritionist or OBGYN... 

How  much more should a baby weight inside? How much weight should I gain? Should I am to stay the same?

May I continue to drink whey protein after workouts?

It is okay to loose weight when pregnant?

If i should add more calories.... where should I insert them? more snacks?

"Zero Carb, hemorrhoids, digestion and fiber - Long term health advice and Antinutrients?","**WARNING LONG POST**  


Hi. I'm a 21 year old university student, I weigh 130 pounds am 5 ft 10, workout 4 - 5 times a week and am TRYING to be healthy. I come from two fairly medically sick people but those who were health wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 months keto, 1 and a half carnivore. Currently back on SAD/WFMD(Mixed Diet)  


So I just recently was on keto, transferred over to zero carb and found myself doing fairly well for the first two weeks. I can say that the variety was bland and that for people to actually enjoy that WOE is insane, I understand that with time your pallet would change and eventually you'd adapt to the food and possibly no longer really care for what was being eaten, but a constant onslaught of eggs, beef and pork was not something I found enjoyable.   


Prior to the diet change I was someone who regularly ate raw vegetables (anti-nutrients not taken into consideration since I hadn't known about them yet), oats, wheat, buckwheat, whole grain rice (red, brown) and what not. I had LOTS of gas and was trying to put on weight, I understood however that I was probably not really eating as many calories as I needed and eating too many grains, thus causing my stomach issues (family never had issues like this so it was odd to me). I had also seen 4 doctors, each prescribing me ppis and each time after not willing to do anything more than an H.pylori test (negative) on me.   


Now the reason I first started Keto was due to an issue within my stomach, I don't know the cause but I had GERD post meals and that I was having pain in my rear. Keto did in fact help resolve these issues so I didn't really complain, but then I upped my fat one night to reach my macros as I had previously read that too much protein can cause issues (not with your ketones but in terms of oxidative stress) and used olive oil and felt strange. I also noticed that I was having issues with actually passing stool, I was told by Keto-discord folk that this was normal as you have more ""easily"" absorbed food and this was due to ""fat adoption"" but what I felt wasn't nausea, instead it was a feeling of liquid gurgling in my stomach and pain in my lower left side so I said ""ok"" and just ignored it. Come next morning I finally had a stool movement, and lo and behold, blood follows the end trail. I think to myself ""ok"" and just kinda roll with it. This repeats multiple times and I kinda just say screw it, must be the veggies and maybe too much fat.   


I moved to carni at this point, from here on out things SOMEWHAT RESOLVE, there's a lingering dullness there and an itch in my rear. But every bowel movement becomes more and more strained, and more bloody. I noticed the consistent pressure in my stomach and feeling like the food I was eating was kinda just sitting there. This was also around the time I heard about paleo-medicina and their reported keto-paleogenic diet and success with curing UC IBS and other digestive issues (mostly remission for some but also cancer remission cases were recorded so I found that to be interesting). So I decided to try that, it required me upping my fat and including ""whole food animal sources"" so I got brain, kidney, liver and tongue, but the diet was incredibly strict and the two weeks I did attempt it I found myself hating the diet more and more. And my symptoms got worse, it was harder to pass stools and then after one ""session"" I found myself going from one end to the other, with it mostly being blood at this point. So I began to question if this diet truly worked for everyone and decided to go off it and have been off it for two days.  


Currently eating basmati-white rice, lean ground meat and some bone broth. I've visited a doctor last week and was told my white blood cell count was low and my inflammation markers were slightly elevated. I'm due for an ultrasound soon and I'm waiting to see where I can go from there. Prior to this diet fiasco I had blood work done and was told my markers were relatively normal.  


My stools have gotten less bloody in the past two days, however still feeling pretty shitty. I've also begun applying Proctosedyl on my rear as both my doctor and I assume I've caused fissures within my stomach due to the pressure during the movements.   


Now I've lost the GERD and the only thing I'm focusing on now is the issue with the dull pain in my stomach and the blood, my question is on returning to such a standard diet while trying to gain weight and trying to eat ""healthy"". **How do I remove antinutrients** in my diet, what grains or foods should I incorporate in my diet, especially considering I have fissures or hemmorhoids (depends which, we don't know yet until the ultra sound). **Is fiber important and can I currently eat any with a stomach that essentially has cuts in it**?

**2x Main Dish**  
Wild Alaskan Salmon  
Cauliflower Rice  
Egg  
Olive Oil topped throughout  
Hemp Protein Powder Drink  
Chia Seeds

**Butternut Pumpkin soup** (the only relatively starch/carb thing I can consume)

**Coconut Pancakes**Made with coconut flour and coconut oil and 2 eggs

**Avocado Olive Oil and Chia Seeds.** Huge amounts of water throughout day (Obviously)

This only just satisfies me calories wise with moderate excercise included. And within my resulting Macro's lies 50 Grams Saturated Fat. 150 grams fat in total.

My question is with all the conflict on the topic of amount of Fat am I hindering my health with this amount that looks excessive next to some of the other Low Carb, Keto based etc amounts. I know Saturated fat = unhealthy is mostly a myth but I also know too much of anything = usually becomes a bad thing. I've heard it's more about the source of the fat then the fat itself but if anybody has any thoughts to help out it would be much appreciated.",nutrition,1553647316,nobietyhighs,7,2,True,2019-03-26

Choices between Pre's and Protein's; HELP!," 

Hi r/Nutrition,

I’ve been playing around with different Protein Powders and Pre-workouts, but I would like to get some advice, I am from Canada as that changes some of the options.

**Proteins:**

1. Pro Jym (Smores seems FANTASTIC)
2. Isopure
3. ON (Optimum Nutrition)
4. MyProtein
5. CanadianProtein Grass-Fed New Zealand Whey Protein Isolate

Pro Jym seems like top of the line and the price everyone complains about doesn’t seem that out of line, S’mores seems so tasty and in theory there is lots of science behind it. Isopure is what I currently take, the Dutch Chocolate version. Made by ON, but has a lot more vitamins and the such. ON needs no explanation really, but I feel it’s too basic? MyProtein and CanadianProtein both have enormous bags of 11lb/5kg and are both seemingly popular within Canada.

**Pre-workout:**

1. Pre Jym (Heard you need Post Jym too?)
2. C4
3. Legion Pulse
4. Transparent Labs Bulk/Lean

Pre Jym seems like top of the line as well, I hear a lot of good and bad such as needing Post Jym as Pre Jym is 1/2 and Post is the other. C4 my original Pre I don’t know why I changed necessarily, but I see it pop up every now and again on here. Legion Pulse seems to be gaining tons of traction, so it caught my eye.. Transparent Laba apparently is the literal pinnacle of Pres?

"Low carb, high carb, vegan, keto... what should a guy do?","Lately I've heard lots of talk about calcium score scans and noticed that people advocating it as more important marker for heart disease than cholesterol seem to follow low carb/keto diet and consider carbs the main culprit of coronary artery disease and such.

So both camps are trying to reach the same conclusion (not have a heart attack), with pretty much opposing diets. Both also have studies and professionals to back their views.

"Is anyone here an actual nutritionist by training/degree? My wife is already an MD but is looking into going back to school in ´nutrition´, and I don't even know what that entails... So, ´nutritionists of Reddit´...what´s up? :)","Basically the title. My wife asked me to post here, as she has no idea what Reddit is...and while 100% fluent in English, shed rather her ´American Redditor´ post on her behalf.

Thanks for anyone who takes the time to read this!

*(TLDR at the bottom!)*

**Backstory...**

My wife is an MD already here in Barcelona (she went to med school in Spain, but she has training/has studied in Germany as well, and has done Doctors w/o Borders in Angola too). Not bragging or trying to add unnecessary info - just trying to establish her credibility and her backstory, and how (or if) it would affect her decision making, reasoning, or “is it worth it” calculation with regards to going back to school.

Long story short - she is bored with being a GP. Here in Spain, in the public system (which is *great* \- not the ´´waiting lists and hell hole socialist system´´ BS you'd hear on Fox News in the US), she hardly has 7 minutes per patient. The system is great for patients but doctors are human machines. In one patient, out the next. Prescribe pills, don't try to fix the baseline issue, next please! The bureaucracy of it all is killing her, and the boredom. And with the dissatisfaction comes the desire for an alternate “angle” in medicine. 

My wife is fascinated in nutrition - always has been - but never enough to do anything about it (career wise). But since getting pregnant/having a baby, and the influx of American documentaries we watch on Netflix re: food sourcing, disease, nutrition, et al, her fascination has turned to obsession. And now she has an itch she can't quite scratch.

She's sick of treating symptoms and wants to help patients with underlying issues - what they eat. Nutrition issues. Supplements. Lifestyle choices. Etc etc. So much so that she wants to go ´back to school´ 

**Her question...**

If she already has an MD, does that help in any way going back to school for nutrition? Is it worth it (a personal issue I know).

What *is* the degree exactly...as I assume it cannot be as simple as ´Masters in Nutrition´, and bam, off you go...

How long are typical American programs, and what are the more well known ones? I'm assuming these are 2 year degrees you'd get at a regular university, but my research is conflictive. 

Are most nutritionists in private practice? How´s the pay?

What's daily work like? Typical patients?

*So many questions.*..just need a tiny bit of info (best websites, books, etc) on how to proceed with the first step, info gathering, and so forth. 

*Would love to hear from practicing nutritionists and how they got there - and most importantly - if they enjoy their work!*

**tl;dr.**..wife is already a doctor but wants to be a nutritionist. Or at minimum, go back for an additional degree, add that to her CV and specialise. Is this ´worth it´, feasible, etc? Or should she ´stick to her day job´ (or find a new GP job!).

*Sorry for the long RAMBLING post, but literally - way too much info out there its exhausting (especially comparing USA options to EU options!). Sheesh.* ",nutrition,1553716372,jax2bcn,1,3,True,2019-03-27

Healthiest way to split your macros?,"Hello!

While my carbs are on the lower end of the moderate scale, I have been dealing with constant digestion issues and so have kept my fibre intake high at about 25-30g. 

Since my digestion issues are still ongoing, I decided to up my carbs to 40% with protein and fat at 30%. Ive been reading loads and loads about the best ways  to split macros and maintain a healthy diet, but there’s very little on this other than suggestions for weight loss.

&gt; *Animal-based foods are also nutritious, and cutting out food groups runs the risk of nutritional deficiency and related health problems.*

I spoke to a nutritionist who recommended that I begin eating around 1500 calories per day, which is more than I've eaten in almost a year.

I'm incredibly terrified. I spent most of yesterday, my first day on the 1500, pretty much just in this constant state of terrible disappointment and dread. Like to the extent that I can't function.

Today I am trying to do it again, but the 1500 seems like so much. I  am pretty much sedentary; I have a desk job. I usually maintain around 120 or 125, but right now I weigh less than that. I don't want to gain a ton of weight, and I'm incredibly worried.

Thanks so much for any help!",nutrition,1549893979,TheObeseSuperhero,9,1,True,2019-02-11

How effective is calorie counting for dieting?,"A little background to my question. Im a big man 275, 6’0, I workout 6 days a week. I have recently decided its time to slim down to about 240. The most effective method at this, and the healthiest I have been taught is to calorie count.

Now I have heard of the 3500 calorie rule, eliminate 3500 from your diet, lose a pound, eat 3500 more than your BMR and your calories burnt moving, you gain a pound, but how effective is this? Could I in theory just eat french fries and burgers as long as i stay under the calories for the day required to net a negative amount? Could I just eat 1 meal a day and kill my metabolism but still be under my amount and lose the pound?

HELP! My boyfriend just found out he has a tear in his esophagus where it meets his stomach- what should he eat and what should he avoid?,"To sum up, my boyfriend has had an ongoing issue for about a year now where he will get extremely ill when eating, essentially his back will start to get very sore and next thing he'll be vomiting non stop long after his stomach is empty and he will be doubled over in pain with a fever. After seeing a doctor multiple times and being told it was neurovirus , I finally dragged him to the hospital when he got sick from eating one ravioli. I shared with the doctor that I was suspecting it could be an ulcer (because no one had thought to look for that apparently) so they did an endoscopy and found a three cm tear in his esophagus where it meets his stomach. I know he should be avoiding acidic foods and sticking to more alkaline ones but I'm not sure what that includes. Any help is appreciated!!

How do you deal with a passively unsupportive family?,"I did not know how to word the title correctly, but I'm not talking about a family that openly criticizes you for your change in fitness, more of a family that has accepted the way that they are, and continue to act the way they are without taking your choice into account.

I've started IF (OMAD) 2 weeks ago, since I do not eat breakfast,  and usually have a late lunch I felt it would be easier for me to just cut out lunch and only have supper. 

Although my wife is home all day, I enjoy cooking, so will come home from work and cook supper for her and myself. Which is great, because I just make what I want, which is usually tasty enough for her.
Her family lives in the same building so we will often have them over for supper or go to their place.

Anytime she wants to make supper, it's a huge bowl of pasta (I'm talking like 6 servings) and if I make something else for myself she ""feels terrible"" and it's my fault, I "" need to be able to cheat"".

I've lost 5lbs, I feel that I could have lost more (and I admit, its 100% my fault)

But how do you have the motivation to take one serving of pasta when everyone is having giant bowls? The people I am surrounded with say they are supportive, but their actions dictate otherwise, it's not their fault, because they are used to eating the way they are, but serving me 3 servings of pasta and giving me a look when I eat 1/3 of it really makes me feel like crap.

Short review of research on artificial sweeteners,"There have been a few questions about artificial sweeteners in this sub over the past few days, so I thought I'd do a brief review of research on their effects on weight loss/gain and metabolic health. This is *not* comprehensive, but I hope you'll find it interesting:

&amp;#x200B;

**Substituting sucrose for artificial sweeteners in the short term may be beneficial for weight loss.**

10 week intervention study: overweight men and women consumed daily supplements of either sucrose or artificial sweeteners.  After 10 weeks, body weight, fat mass, and blood pressure increased in the sucrose group and decreased in the sweetener group. [https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/76/4/721/4677434](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/76/4/721/4677434)

&amp;#x200B;

**However, long term use does not help weight loss or prevent weight gain – in fact, it may do the opposite.**

The San Antonio Heart Study examined 3,682 adults over a seven- to eight-year period in the 1980s. When matched for initial body mass index (BMI), gender, ethnicity, and diet, drinkers of artificially sweetened beverages consistently had higher BMIs at the follow-up, with dose dependent on the amount of consumption. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535548/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535548/)

The American Cancer Society study conducted in early 1980s included 78,694 women who were highly homogenous with regard to age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and lack of preexisting conditions. After one year, 2.7 percent to 7.1 percent more regular artificial sweetener users gained weight compared to non-users matched by initial weight. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3714671](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3714671)

After 25 weeks of substituting diet beverages for sugar-sweetened beverages in 103 adolescents in a randomized controlled trial, BMI did not decrease except among the heaviest participants. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16510646](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16510646)

The majority of pediatric epidemiologic studies have found a positive correlation between weight gain and artificially sweetened beverage intake. This review identified a general trend that artificial sweeteners may reduce total caloric intake when consumed between meals, but when consumed with meals, children may compensate for low calorie snacks or drinks by increasing calories during the meal. [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17477160903497027](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17477160903497027)

&amp;#x200B;

**Consuming large amounts of artificial sweeteners over the long term is not good for metabolic health.**

Study in mice: Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame) drive the development of glucose intolerance (a hallmark of pre-diabetes) by inducing compositional and functional alterations to gut microbiota. Of the artificial sweeteners, saccharin had the most pronounced effect. Several of the bacterial taxa that changed following artificial sweetener consumption are associated with type 2 diabetes in humans. [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13793](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13793) Full text: [https://www.diabetes.org.br/publico/images/pdf/artificial-sweeteners-induce-glucose-intolerance-by-altering-the-gut-microbiota.pdf](https://www.diabetes.org.br/publico/images/pdf/artificial-sweeteners-induce-glucose-intolerance-by-altering-the-gut-microbiota.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

**Artificial sweeteners likely enhance (or at least continue to enable) our ‘sweet tooth.’ Reducing sweetness across our diets – including consumption of artificially sweetened foods – may reduce preference for sugar over the long term.**

Repeated exposure to sweetness increases the preference for sweet flavors. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15581664](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15581664)

Conversely, systematic reduction of dietary salt or fat without any flavorful substitution over the course of several weeks led to a preference for lower levels of those nutrients in the research subjects. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7148734/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7148734/) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8438771](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8438771)",nutrition,1550071330,darcy1805,3,1,True,2019-02-13

I already ingest 2 tbsp olive oil daily and 2 tbsp coconut oil (~500 calories combined). I know there's some debate on coconut oil/saturated fat so I'd replace the nuts with olive oil. 

Besides differences like fiber from the nuts, just wondering if the liquid fat would be unhealthy. My instinct is it makes no difference- just replacing nonsaturated fat with nonsaturated fat, but that much liquid fat gives me some pause.",nutrition,1550093399,thelakenightshow,1,1,True,2019-02-13

nutrition bachelors? your experiences studying nutrition,"hi there, 

i'm currently considering switching my major from (currently) undeclared arts bachelor to nutritional sciences. I'm not sure what I would be interested in doing, maybe study diabetics (which runs in the family- i'd love to help in that way, maybe through community work) or through food marketing, ect. but I was wondering what your experiences are studying nutrition?

are you happy studying/studied nutrition? are future prospects a big issue? things someone should know before switching into nutrition, ect. 

what happens if you don't go for an RD, is it really useless as some people say? 

I've never really considered myself a really 'science/math' person, i've liked the courses in high school, but it was always a longer process for me. so i know it's going to be a bit tough GPA-wise. I'm doing well, i think, in my arts program but i'm not sure if its better to have a high gpa with a degree i really have no passion for? or try something i might have a passion for? i realize after graduate, i want to do something related to food! 

I wanted to go into culinary school/patiserrie-route before going to university, but i was unable to due to personal health issues, but i want to find other ways to go into food! 

if anyone could offer me advice/their experiences, it would be greatly appreciated :) thank you

Not losing any weight on massive caloric deficit,"Hi all,

I have a bizarre problem with a client/friend, who asked me to help him with dieting. Long story short:

&amp;#x200B;

He is 195 cm tall (6""5), 25 YO, starting weight 108 kg (238 lbs), current weight 100 kg (220 lbs), current BF around 20 %. Has physical job (car mechanic), runs and swims 3-4 times a week, sleeps 7-8 hrs a day.

&amp;#x200B;

1) I thought him how to count calories, so he created a diet to get him to caloric deficit

2) He started at 2500 kcal, but couldnt lose any weight

3) He lowered the caloric intake to 2200-2300 kcal, lost around 5 kg in 3 months orso, then he could no longer lose weight on this caloric deficit

4) Lowered the caloric intake to around 2000, lost about 2-3 kg in another 1-2 months, then same scenario happened

5) Currently he is on 1400-1600 kcal and he is not losing any weight...

&amp;#x200B;

His entire daily diet basically consists of:

\- Greek yogurt with oats and some fruit for breakfast

\- 100-150 grams of meat, veggies and side dish (typical small restaurant portion) for lunch

\- toast with veggies and ham for lunch

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was ""There is no way ure eating 1400-1600 kcal"", I mean its basically decent caloric deficit for small 60 kg girl....but I saw what he is eating and it rly seems to be correct number. My question, how is this even possible? Did his metabolism completely crash? Could it be some thyroid/other issue? How can 100 kg physically active man not lose any weight on 1500 kcal? I mean just his BMI should be higher than that. He said he has had blood work done and they havent rly found anything.

Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this/how is this even possible?

&amp;#x200B;

Will be grateful for any help

EGCG: DR. OZ TOUTS BENEFITS FOR LOWERING OVARIAN CANCER RISK," 

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most plentiful catechin in tea and is a very powerful antioxidant that can help with lots of different health issues. Well-known TV doctor, Dr. Oz, recently revealed that drinking green tea (containing the highest amount of EGCG) may help to reduce the risk of contracting many forms of cancer and, specifically, ovarian cancer.

Apart from water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world. A study conducted in China with over 1000 women who drank four or more cups of green tea or oolong tea per day showed that their risk of contracting ovarian cancer reduced by a whopping 82%.

Click here to check out our Private Label Green Tea Extract Liquid.

Based on published research, it appears that the cancerous cells are destroyed by the EGCG in the tea before they have the chance to spread through the ovaries and to other parts of the body. It’s important to understand that although this article is only about ovarian cancer, it appears EGCG may also greatly reduce the risk of contracting many other forms of cancer at the same time.

Dr. Oz’s guest on his show, Dr. William Li, is a cancer researcher. He explained that tea also contains flavonoids, which account for approx. 1/3 of the weight of the tea. EGCG is the most powerful of all flavonoids. It’s a core constituent of both oolong and green tea and it can potentially kill ovarian cancer cells before they can spread.

Studies have shown that EGCG causes a process known as apoptosis to occur in cancerous cells. This process (apoptosis) means “the death of a cell” and means it prevents cancer cells in ovaries, the liver, prostate, breasts and lungs from growing and multiplying while protecting the healthy cells from additional attacks.

The substance hinders DNA methyltransferase and telomerase, two enzymes that are involved in cellular immortality and cancer gene expression thus meaning that the cells are no longer immortal.

It’s obvious that everybody wants to avoid getting all forms of cancer. Even the smallest cancerous cells can cause a wide array of problems and result in surgery and/or chemotherapy and other treatments. Whether it’s benign or malignant is also a huge issue for anybody who is diagnosed to face.

Having surgery for cancer can be extremely painful but it’s the recovery time that can be even more difficult to manage, depending on the severity of the disease. Regardless, there will be a period of healing and, hopefully, the cancerous cells will be removed.

If you can avoid having surgery or chemotherapy in the first place, wouldn’t you drink some tea or take a regular green tea extract? This is obviously a rhetorical question.

Lots of people don’t like drinking tea for whatever reason. The positive news is that you can also get a green tea extract that contains 45-50% EGCG and take that instead of drinking lots of tea.

Sodium intake,"I’ll keep this relatively short - I’m currently trying to look after my body a bit better than usual and am aiming to lose about 2 stone over the next 6-8 months. I’m using the app ‘my fitness pal’ to keep track of what I’m eating and I’m easily staying within the recommended guidelines of everything except sodium.

So my question is do I need to be stricter and really search for low sodium foods or should I be able to progress okay if I’m staying within the guidelines for everything else?

How to avoid carbs when eating out/trying to bulk?,"When bulking/trying to build muscle, but without the time to do meal prep or home cook most meals, is there an easy way to avoid carbs when eating out while also being able to eat a lot of protein?  

I've found that a typical day meal-wise would be something along the lines of an egg sandwich for breakfast, grilled chicken sandwich for lunch, and then maybe grilled chicken with rice and beans for dinner. Are there any easy substitutes for things like bread, tortilla's, rice, etc. when eating out or is cooking your own meals the only answer here?

Also how much protein is considered too much? I've read online that you should eat between 50-80% of your body weight in grams of protein, but at the same time I've heard many people say you want to eat upwards of 100%.

I'm curious about this because this is all relatively new to me and I'm a little confused as to whether or not I'm doing something wrong or missing something.

[Research Discussion] (Amino Acid Content of Common Protein Extracts (heat map)),"[Here is the figure](https://imgur.com/a/MEuyddR)

**Methodology** I made a heat map of the amino acid content (g) in 100g of various protein extracts by compiling the assay information on popular protein powder brands and normalizing them to 100g. I used excel to create a heat map where the colors span each row from green (highest content of a particular AA) to red (lowest content). Animal proteins are to the left, veggie proteins on the right.


**Purpose.** The heat map allows me to see which amino acids I may be missing when supplementing a particular type of protein, and choose a complementary protein to fill the gap. It also would allow one to quickly access which protein source would be the best to supplement for a particular amino acid. 

**Limitations.** The source of the data is mostly from assay information provided by manufacturers. As with any biological source, there is sample variability. So the data should be regarded as approximate. For example, the total amino acid content of the whey and collagen assays exceed 100g for a 100g sample, which suggests the amino acid content was over-estimated.",nutrition,1550188678,haolekokua,11,1,True,2019-02-14

2000 Calories of Healthy Foods vs 1000 Calories of Junk Food - Which is healthier?," 

Today was valentines day and  I was surrounded by a LOT of junk food. I had only consumed 600ish calories before dinner. I'm a bigger-than-big guy so my calorie ""limit"" for the day was 2.4k. When I got to the table (I'm 15 and live with parents) I saw cupcakes, those heart-shaped boxes of chocolate, and some cookies, steak, mashed potatoes, carrots, asparagus. I was conflicted on what I should eat,  I hadn't eaten a lot of junk food at once in quite a while and had been very active and eaten little calories that day, however I also didn't think pigging most of my daily calorie intake on sweets would still mean I was ""eating healthy"" even if it was under the number of calories suggested. So this brought me to this question.  

Would I lose more weight eating: 2000 Calories of Healthy foods (chicken, greens, eggs ext.) or 1000 Calories of Junk foods: (Cupcakes, Ice cream, Chocolates) I'm not educated on nutrition at all but I do know macronutrients are a thing but I don't know if calories are should take priority over macros. Interested to see what you guys have to say, couldn't find an answer to this question and hoped I could get some good conversation going, thanks for your time.

Recently ive started looking at the labels of the packages of breasts and noticed that 3 chicken breasts typically weigh around 2.25lbs (36 oz), meaning that one breast would actually be around 12oz and thus about 60g of protein. Is this possible? It sounds like a dumb question but 60g seems a lot for just one breast.

Why is there so many different views on human nutrition?,"Heya. I have this ""very deep"" question. I'm studying animal management course and I realised that in my nutrition lessons, everythinig about what animals are supposed to eat is very, very clear. There are even ways to know how much nutrients will the cat or dog get from fats or carbs. It's fascinating to me. If it is SO clear how much exactly of what cats, dogs, rabbits etc. need... why is it so confusing for humans? I'm for exmaple vegetarian, and even though I believe humans are omnivores (which they are, our track and teeth tell that) I also believe we can survive and live just fine on this diet. The thing is, every doctor, institute, website or person says something different. Someone might be feeling absolutely crap on vegetarian diet because their body ""needs"" meat, some people have been vegans for 30 years and they look better than most their age...   
 

I know this is more of a philosophical question but I am just really curious why are we sure what the proper diet is with cats and dogs but not with humans? Wouldn't there be exponentially more research into it?

"Advice on clean eating, and personal food substitutions."," 

As title says, this upcoming Monday I will be starting a 3 month clean diet regimen. I haven’t decided if this will be a cut or maintenance diet, but either way it will be a fat loss/healthier lifestyle plan.

Currently 6’1”, 201 lbs and have been lifting for about 3 years. Diet has always been somewhat of an issue. I don’t eat like a pig or very unhealthy but I would love to shore up my diet and see what I can accomplish in these 3 months.

To help with this, I’d like to come up with 4 variations of a breakfast, lunch, and dinner meal. So 12 total meals, all geared towards being considered very healthy. Money is not a huge issue when it comes to food, so all alternatives will be heard and considered.

* So here’s an idea of what I eat and would love suggestions on alternatives for these listed foods.
* JIF Peanut Butter and Jelly on Wheat Bread 
* Scrambled Eggs 
* String Cheese
* Sandwich meat chicken breast (The packaged kind) with mayo and kraft cheese. 
* Chicken Quesadilla with shredded packaged cheese. 
* Ground Turkey/Chicken tacos/burritos with lettuce, sour cream, and shredded cheese. 
* And then I eat out a lot. Panda express, jimmy johns, and the occasional taco bell.

Dinner foods need absolutely the most help. Looking for recommendations on dinner/lunch. I love chicken, eggs are good, ground turkey is yum, fish is good, and I can definitely eat salads and vegetables. 

So basically i’m looking on how to clean up these foods like; organic peanut butter instead. cheese alternatives. Better sandwich meat etc.

I'll be cutting out of my eating out habits and basically just would like some advice on a grocery list, foods to look for, foods to stay away from. Also, I’ll be switching from a milk/Gatorade liquid life, to a hopefully pure water life. So anything to make water easier to drink would be awesome too.

The symptoms of deficiency include a higher cancer risk, a greater risk to develop atheroma, cardiomyopathy, and arthritis.

Are carbohydrates demonized while protein heralded? Is the solution to rather just focus on whole foods and plats rather than on particular macronutrients?

* **Phylloquinone (K1)**, which is synthesized by plants, it is involved in blood coagulation;
* **Menaquinone (K2)**, which is synthesized by bacteria, it has not been completely characterized yet and can have multiple functions spanning from [bone health](https://www.gianlucatognon.com/osteoporosis-a-public-health-problem-also-for-men/) to cardiovascular disease prevention. I will tell you more about its functions in my next post;
* **Dihydrophylloquinone**, which is formed during the commercial hydrogenation of plant oils.

Natto (a fermented Japanese type of food) is considered the most concentrated source of vitamin K2.

What kind of cookware is safest to use?,"Ive been wondering what kind of cookware I should be using for a while now.  I ended up buying all stainless steel.

This man Dave Asprey claims stainless steel  allows nickel to enter your body and cast iron puts too much iron..

Wtf?!   Is any of this true.   I know its alot to read.   Read what you can or just skim over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Dave Asprey: 

This is something I‟ve worked on for years and it‟s not as obvious as you think. You definitely do not want to be using straight stainless steel. Unfortunately restaurants are required to use stainless steel even though you will get nickel in your food from it because stainless steel contains nickel and nickel is one of the metals you don‟t really want in your body especially if you are cooking tomato sauce or anything with acid. That just kind of happens when you go out to eat. At home, you don‟t need to do that to yourself. Cast iron, I don‟t recommend because it puts a lot of iron in your food and the iron is actually very pro-oxidative in the body unless you have anemia which you shouldn‟t have when you‟re on the Bulletproof diet. You don‟t really need to eat things done in cast iron. Not a good idea. So that leaves us with what kinds of cookware isn‟t going to leave your food picking up stuff you don‟t want in it. Clearly, Teflon is out. At or above 400 degrees, Teflon does emit gas. There‟s some fluorine effects and I know it‟s really convenient to cook with this stuff but we know for a fact that on an electric or gas stove some part of the pan rich higher than 450 degrees even if the whole pan doesn‟t. I don‟t like it but that‟s the way it is. So what‟s left? You can go with a porcelain or you can go with a Pyrex pan or you can go with some ceramics. Those are your choices. Ceramics are nice in that they are relatively light weight but like the Pyrex or the glass pans, they hold a ton of heat. So what I did is I went out and bought myself a set of Le Creuset, the cool looking, heavy duty, basically cast iron with a heavy enamel inside them. I bought those because I was thinking it will keep my family from getting stuff from cookware and since we cook a lot at home, this matters. There‟s just one problem. If you have Pyrex or you have Le Creuset or you have ceramic, they hold so much heat that you‟re going to burn your food. You are going to oxidize the oils and denature the proteins cause when you pull it off the burner, it keep cooking for maybe five to ten minutes just as the heat radiates from the pan. Now, if you look at the cooking section of the Bulletproof diet on the inforgraphic, lightly cooked protein and fat is much better than well done. I found that a relatively qualified chef in the kitchen, I could not control temperature well enough in my food. I have the sous-vide set up where I can have one degree increments in food. Heavy duty metal pans will destroy the quality of your cooking and they make your food less healthy. I finally settled on relatively thin pans that are coated with enamel on the inside so they are basically white enameled pans on the inside and they are makes by a company called Tivoli.",nutrition,1550485763,lukasthomas12345,6,2,True,2019-02-18

Why is dried but not fresh ginger a great source of manganese?,"I understand that dried is more concentrated but i notice on nutritiondata, even if you input fresh ginger that would be the equivalent to the amount you would get in dry, it still comes to much less manganese. Im assuming this cant be right 
and someone just didnt put the numbers in for fresh like they did dry. It would be similar to if you took one fresh strawberry and then dried it and got more iron in the one strawberry that is now dried and shriveled. Yes, different volume since all water has been sucked out but the one shriveled strawberry is still equivalent to one fresh.

VITAMIN BUSINESS STARTUP CHECKLIST," 

We’ve worked with many nutraceutical startups over the years, and time after time we hear that one of the most beneficial services we provide is our checklist of things to do before launching a nutritional supplement or vitamin product.  With this in mind, we’ve decided to post a “launch checklist” so that you can focus you attention on post-launch sales rather than cleaning up problems that could have been resolved with careful planning prior to launch.  Although this isn’t an exhaustive checklist, it should serve as a good starting point as you begin to conceptualize the direction and focus of your company and decide how you want to market your product. Whether you are trying to open a home business selling vitamins, or simply expanding your website to sell supplements online, this checklist will help get you on the way to success.

As you go through the following list, be sure to write out any ideas or questions that you have on a notepad.  These notes will allow you to focus on areas of your business plan that need to be formulated more concisely and will give you a better understanding of different issues that may require further research.

#### (A) Business Concept and Strategy:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Formulation** Do you know if you want your product formulated as a powder, pill, or a liquid supplement?  Do you have any special requests such as enteric coating or added dyes?  Make sure that you have at least 3 solid selling points over your competition from a formulation standpoint (i.e. “my protein pills are better for building muscle because they contain…”).  In addition to ingredients used, you can also promote the benefits of your supplement’s delivery methods (i.e. liquid vitamins vs. pill vitamins).
* **Advertising and Sales Channel Plans** Determining your target audience is tremendously important in marketing your product.  This will not only determine how you advertise, but where.  For instance, if you are marketing a body building supplement, you may leave brochures at a gym describing how your supplement promotes muscle growth.  Or if you are trying to sell a multivitamin for women, you may set up a website about your vitamin with articles about women’s health.
* It’s also important for you to determine if you want to sell directly-to-customers (DTC) or through retail channels.  Although you can obviously do both, it helps to direct your attention to one or the other so that you can focus your resources.

#### (B) Formulation and Production:

&amp;#x200B;

* **NDA Signed** Do you have a NDA signed by each supplement manufacturer that priced your formulas?
* **Ingredients Identified** Have you identified the exact sources and standardizations for all of the ingredients that you are looking for price quotes on?

#### (C) Production:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Contract** Did you sign a formulation agreement with your contract vitamin manufacturer?
* **Manufacturer Legally Allowed to Manufacture Nutritional Supplements** Have you seen any paperwork from a reputable governing authority (State Department of Health, Food and Drug Administration) showing that the manufacturer is legally allowed to manufacture nutritional supplements?  Research your manufacturer online and insist that they show you any pertinent credentials.
* **Obtain a Pre-production Sample** Have you obtained a pre-production sample of the product before purchasing a full production run?  This is important so that you know that what you are ordering is exactly what you want.  If the color, taste, consistency is off, it’s better for you to know prior to several million units being produced.  Also, if you have a pre-production sample and something goes wrong in the actual production run, you can always use this sample as a comparison for that product that you actually wanted produced.
* **Obtain a Certificate of Analysis** Have you received a certificate of analysis for all materials used in the production of your nutritional supplement?

#### (D) Packaging:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Packaging Presentation** Have you decided what images and text that you want to use on your packaging?  Do you know who your target audience is for your product?
* **Samples of bottles or Packets** Have you seen samples of the exact size bottle or packet that your product is going in?
* Make sure that your product has the exact “look” that you are going for.

#### (E) Compliance and Information Review:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Compliance** Have you reviewed your label or packaging for all
* **Domain Name** Does your domain name reflect your company or product name? Make sure that this is something that is both easy to remember and has a direct connection to the product you are selling (e.g. don’t name your website after your dog!).
* **Secure Transactions** Is your website secure for transactions and is that illustrated prominently on the website through logos and seals?
* **Verify Information** Have you verified that all contact and order information is correct including product pricing, special offers, phone number and domain names?  While a website can help you to promote and sell your product, having a website with the incorrect information on it will frustrate consumers and drive away sales.

#### (F) Operations:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Tested Mechanism of Deposits** Have you “test charged” to make sure that credit cards and funds are deposited into the desired back account without any hiccups or mishaps?  Just think how frustrating (embarrassing) it would be to find out that you’ve sold 1,000 units on your first day, but that they’ve all of the funds have been deposited in the wrong bank account!  A single missed digit is all it takes, so be sure to do a deposit test run.

#### (G) Shipping:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Invoices, Packing Slips, and Shipping Labels** Can you print out invoices, packing slips, shipping labels and all other documents needed for shipping product?  It may seem ok to hand write invoices now, but when you get orders for hundreds of vitamins, it’s important to have a computerized way of printing out all of your documentation.

#### (H) Storage:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Protecting Your Product** Do you have a cool, dry place to store your supplements out of the sun to protect them prior to delivery to cialis generique customers?  It’s important to keep it safe and stable because relatively minor temperature and humidity variations can destroy supplements. If you are working with a vitamin drop shipper, then this won’t be a problem.

Freshly squeezing my own citrus juice - as bad as it’s made out to be?,"I’m pregnant and I’m really enjoying citrus right now. I’ve been using those handheld citrus squeezer items to squeeze out some juice for me. I like to have grapefruit, lemon and lime.

Are my gaining fat or muscle? Increased protein intake and switched modified cardiovascular exercise,"I'm a 6'0 21 y/o male and have lost a drastic amount of weight through  23:1 IF, CICO and doing 60 minutes of not-so intense cardio on a daily basis (primarily a cross-trainer with almost no resistance).   
 

Majority of my weight loss has happened through a relatively high carb , moderate (low if anything) protein and low fat diet.   
 

Being happy with the weight I'm at now, I recently lowered my carbs and  decided to increase my protein intake (as well as fat). I have also  switched to an elliptical trainer and increased the resistance (8-10 -  which is obviously \*way\* more difficult in comparison to what I usually  do).   
 

I eat a metric ton of chicken now and have started consuming protein  shakes (I am still consuming the same amount of calories as before -  which places me in a deficit, if anything - I am consuming less because  of the satiety that I'm getting from my increased protein consumption).   
 

Recently, I have noticed changes in my body composition and I'm not sure whether it's a good or bad thing.   
 

My body somewhat seems to be growing in size (if that makes sense?  Getting bigger / wider, primarily in my legs). My clothes have become a  lot more tight but I'm not sure whether it's fat or actual lean muscle? I  didn't think that it would be possible to actually start building  muscle through cardio (I don't do any weight lifting at all).  
 

The majority of the composition change seems to be in my legs (they seem  to be getting bulky and bigger, I also have increased vascularity in my  calves which has happened over a 2 week period).   
 

How can I avoid having 'bigger' calves / legs?

&gt;  
&gt;Monster Ultra (zero-cal)  
&gt;

&gt;

&gt;15g vegan hot-chocolate mix

Okra!," 

I have a sorted history with okra. Knowing what I know now about the health benefits, I've been engaging in healing my relationship with this awesome vegetable (really its a fruit). Many folks living in the northern US do not regularly include okra in their diets compared to folks in the south. Let's take a closer look at okra for those of you who may have never cooked or eaten it before.

Okra is also known as lady fingers or ochro. Lady fingers because the fruit pod is elongated, slender and ends in a tip. The whole plant can be eaten. The leaves can be cooked like spinach or beets leaves, and the seeds that are found in the pod can be roasted to make a non caffeinated coffee substitute. But its the pods that most people cook with. The pods can be eaten raw in salads, cooked, or pickled.

Nutritionally, okra contains a fabulous amount of soluble fiber which is very mucilaginous. It also contains a good amount of Vitamin A, C, K; thiamine, folate and magnesium.

My parents are both from the south, my maternal grandmother is creole. A dish that is quite commonly made from New Orleans area is gumbo and one of the primary ingredients is okra. Frankly, as a child I did NOT enjoy gumbo because of the mucilaginous quality bestowed by the okra. Since my young adult years I have shied away from okra. But its just too wonderful of a ingredient to ignore.

The soluble fibers in okra are the key to it being a fantastic plant source to help manage conditions like metabolic syndrome and digestive problems. The great quantity of fibers help to: 1. keep the gut cells healthy and happy, and thus the gut good bacteria happy and thriving; 2. decrease and slow the absorption of simple sugars and carbohydrates thus regulating and helping to manage blood sugar. This is important for pre diabetics, and those with diabetes type 1 and 2!

As I have been working to fall in love with okra, I've come across some recipes that have been helpful. These preparations of okra decrease the sliminess, while still providing the nutty, sweet taste.

Roasting has become a favorite preparation of mine. I like to pre heat the oven to about 400 degrees. The okra should be rinsed and sliced in halves (removing the round end). Halves can be tossed with olive oil, paprika, fresh minced garlic, cumin; salt and pepper to taste. Pods are spread out on a oven pan and roasted for about 20 minutes or until crispy.

Enjoy!!

The 6 Best Breakfast Foods for You 2019 | Healthywikihow," 

[The 6 Best Breakfast Foods for You 2019](https://healthywikihow.com/2019/02/the-6-best-breakfast-foods-for-you-2019/)

Despite what you may have heard, eating **breakfast** isn't necessary for everyone.

In fact, skipping breakfast may be better than eating unhealthy **breakfast foods.**

&amp;#x200B;

However, a nutritious, well-balanced breakfast can give you energy and prevent you from eating too much during the rest of the day.

1. Eggs

Share on Pinterest

Eggs are undeniably healthy and delicious.

&amp;#x200B;

Studies have shown that eating eggs at breakfast increases feelings of fullness, reduces calorie intake at the next meal and helps maintain steady blood sugar and insulin levels (1, 2, 3).

In one study, men who ate eggs for breakfast felt more satisfied and took in fewer calories during the rest of the day than those who consumed a bagel (3).

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin. These antioxidants help prevent eye disorders like cataracts and macular degeneration (4, 5).

&amp;#x200B;

Eggs are also one of the best sources of choline, a very important nutrient for brain and liver health (6).

&amp;#x200B;

Though high in cholesterol, eggs don't raise cholesterol levels in most people.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, eating whole eggs may reduce heart disease risk by modifying the shape of “bad” LDL cholesterol, increasing “good” HDL cholesterol and improving insulin sensitivity (7, 8).

&amp;#x200B;

What's more, three large eggs provide about 20 grams of high-quality protein (9).

&amp;#x200B;

Eggs are also very versatile. For example, hard-boiled eggs make a great portable breakfast that can be prepared ahead of time. [Read more..](https://healthywikihow.com/2019/02/the-6-best-breakfast-foods-for-you-2019/)",nutrition,1550667292,tannu9,1,5,True,2019-02-20

"Getting confused by information if I am proactively getting a healthier diet, or if I'm no where close","I started lifting and wanting to build muscle... By constantly researching and trying to learn about fitness, health, nutrition, etc. I am noticing that I am continually realizing that everything I eat seems to be ""terrible for you and ruining your body"" - It may be conflicting information, but I'm not an expert so its driving me crazy...

**Back in College**, forced to live in dorm by university, the food in the food courts was bad. At that time (3 years ago) I ate no fruit, no vegetables, and it was all *basically* fast food, fried stuff. On the occasion a chicken breast, but that was double priced as a ""fancy menu item.""


**Now, over time I've tried to improve little by little** with 2 steps forward, 1 step back. Now my diet is much improved RELATIVE to that (it still sucks). I get in a grove of eating the same core foods as a picky eater. On disciplined days [non-disciplined is a weekend, eating take out while watching the big game, etc], I always get the following foods:

- Greek yogurt
- Peanut Butter + Wheat bread
- Cashews
- Mandarin orange
- Banana
- Broccoli
- Carrots
- Spinach
- Milk
- Protein powder
- Oatmeal (trying to consistently add this next, haven't been successful yet)

which when I eat I never feel bad. I believe everything is justified nutrition and ""fuel"" with the worst being wheat bread (depending on your opinion of carbs if you are pro-keto, anti-keto)

---

The rest of my diet is the part that I always feel is unhealthy, and ""bad."" It would consist usually of some type of main course dinner made of ground chuck or chicken breast + carb. 

For example, pasta with meat sauce. BBQ chicken breast. Or you could even make home made burger with that same ingredients, just in different form. Its not ""organic"" and the stuff is technically produced packaged stuff that is ""bad for you.""

[That prototypical diet results in the following micro nutrients.](https://i.imgur.com/8FCUleU.png) I don't eat candy/chocolate/icecream/sugar/etc. And I'm losing apetite for the worst fast food chains (ie mcdonalds. Chick fil a still has damn good 60g protein chicken) but I can throw in a homemade burger, a sandwich and potato chips, some wings, etc for a meal and still hit similar micros - which I am hitting all accept a few, while maintaining an above 1:1 potassium/sodium ratio.

**TLDR:** Listening to podcasts, nutrition articles, seeing fitness people only talk about eating leanest meat (tuna/chicken) and green and brown rice, with nothing else... and hearing about how even the perceived ""healthy"" foods because ""its in your kitchen and not fast food"" is actually terribly processed and fake. - I am getting caught up in trying to figure things out.

Do I have the right path? or are those ""chicken breast + broccoli + rice x 3 meals"" people have it figured out since they are obviously fit.

Would a breakfast of meat and nuts be superior to a breakfast with carbohydrates?,"Charles Poliquin wasn't exactly known for his sound dietary advice. However, one of his most popularized ""diets"" is the meat and nuts breakfast.

It would also raise blood sugar more slowly than carbohydrates which would prevent fatigue in the afternoon. 

Anecdotally I've tried it for a month and a half and am actually surprised at how well it has been working. But I also realize that perhaps this is just the placebo effect.

What kind of cookware is the safest to use and wont give me cancer?,"&amp;#x200B;

***This man Dave Asprey claims stainless steel allows nickel to enter your body and cast iron puts too much iron..***

***Wtf?! Is any of this true. I know its alot to read. Read what you can or just skim over it. I thought stainless and cast iron were the safest!***

&amp;#x200B;

Dave Asprey:

This is something I'**ve worked on for years and it‟s not as obvious as you think. You definitely do not want to be using straight stainless steel. Unfortunately restaurants are required to use stainless steel even though you will get nickel in your food from it because stainless steel contains nickel and nickel is one of the metals you don‟t really want in your body especially if you are cooking tomato sauce or anything with acid. That just kind of happens when you go out to eat. At home, you don‟t need to do that to yourself. Cast iron, I don‟t recommend because it puts a lot of iron in your food and the iron is actually very pro-oxidative in the body unless you have anemia which you shouldn‟t have when you‟re on the Bulletproof diet**. You don‟t really need to eat things done in cast iron. Not a good idea. So that leaves us with what kinds of cookware isn‟t going to leave your food picking up stuff you don‟t want in it. Clearly, Teflon is out. At or above 400 degrees, Teflon does emit gas. There‟s some fluorine effects and I know it‟s really convenient to cook with this stuff but we know for a fact that on an electric or gas stove some part of the pan rich higher than 450 degrees even if the whole pan doesn‟t. I don‟t like it but that‟s the way it is. So what‟s left? You can go with a porcelain or you can go with a Pyrex pan or you can go with some ceramics. Those are your choices. Ceramics are nice in that they are relatively light weight but like the Pyrex or the glass pans, they hold a ton of heat. So what I did is I went out and bought myself a set of Le Creuset, the cool looking, heavy duty, basically cast iron with a heavy enamel inside them. I bought those because I was thinking it will keep my family from getting stuff from cookware and since we cook a lot at home, this matters. There‟s just one problem. If you have Pyrex or you have Le Creuset or you have ceramic, they hold so much heat that you‟re going to burn your food. You are going to oxidize the oils and denature the proteins cause when you pull it off the burner, it keep cooking for maybe five to ten minutes just as the heat radiates from the pan. Now, if you look at the cooking section of the Bulletproof diet on the inforgraphic, lightly cooked protein and fat is much better than well done. I found that a relatively qualified chef in the kitchen, I could not control temperature well enough in my food. I have the sous-vide set up where I can have one degree increments in food. Heavy duty metal pans will destroy the quality of your cooking and they make your food less healthy. I finally settled on relatively thin pans that are coated with enamel on the inside so they are basically white enameled pans on the inside and they are makes by a company called Tivoli.",nutrition,1550677803,lukasthomas12345,8,3,True,2019-02-20

What is the cap for protein intake? i.e. How much protein can a person intake at once and have it still be useful for muscle synthesis?,"I have a friend who has been doing intermittent fasting over the last year and staying relatively active (he's in my BJJ academy and so we're both basically wrestling for a couple hours 3x a week). I also do intermittent fasting, but I also started a macro-based diet to help me shed some extra pounds (and for clarity, I'm also doing some weight training to help keep muscle mass healthy while I drop weight on a 500 calorie deficit.) 

[According to this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdNc_6F15mc) on maximizing muscle synthesis, since I am getting a bit older now (mid-40s), I should trying to make sure that I am intaking protein in chunks of at least 30g to optimize muscle synthesis. I was discussing this with my friend and his comment was that he eats his meals in either one large chunk (like all his calories for the day in a single meal) on days where he has previously fasted for 24 hours, or two large chunks on his normal daily 16-hour fasts. I expressed some incredulity at this, thinking surely one can't fully utilize all the protein he is taking in, some 140g a day, in one or two meals. And my cursory Googling tells me that probably the excess protein he is intaking is just being oxidized. Yet he insists he's suffered no muscle loss over the last year with this diet. 

So /r/nutrition, I pose this question to you: what gives? Is there a cap on how much protein I can intake and still use for muscle synthesis or not? If there is a cap, why is my friend reporting no muscle loss over a year of, apparently, not getting nearly enough protein in his diet? I ask mainly because doling out my protein in 30g chunks in an 8 hour intermittent fasting eating window is sometimes quite hard. My lean mass is around 170lbs (77kg) and my protein target right now is 155g/day (right at 2g/kg)...so I am sometimes trying to fit four or five 30-40g protein meals in that 8 hour window. If I can do it in 2 or 3 without a loss in muscle synthesis, it would be great! :)

Red Meat: To Eat or Not to Eat?,"I’m making this post because I’m pretty confused.

When I was growing up, I ate red meat maybe a few times a week. I would eat it in bolognese (pasta sauce), my mom’s meatballs, meatloaf, flank steak stir fry, and ravioli. On occasion, I would have sausage, steak, or a pork chop.

I became interested in cleaning up my diet and eating healthier about two years ago to improve my digestion, mental health, and overall well-being. It’s gone pretty well. It did happen to lead to an interest in nutrition studies and what I should and shouldn’t eat and why.

I have read the good and the bad about red meat. Paleo and low carb circles say it’s great for you and that claims against it are misguided. Plantbased circles say it’s terrible for you and should be avoided at all costs because it causes a whole host of ailments. Both seem a tad extreme.

On the other hand, general nutrition advice tells us we should limit red meat, and the Mediterrean diet, which is widely praised, also advocates against red meat in favor of white meat and fish.

I mainly cut red meat out of my diet because I was really scared by the claims that it can cause or increase the risk of cancer. That would probably be my biggest reason for not eating for two years now.

Still, my confusion is furthered by the fact that red meats seem like a natural whole food that should be good for humans. 

Is red meat the problem, or is it just non-organic, grain-fed, antibiotic containing red meat?

Is red meat really bad for you, or not?

I would like some input because I want to figure out whether or not it would be healthy for me to start to eat it again.

"Dr. Michael Greger's Daily Dozen, Full Comprehensive List with Embedded Video Resources","If you frequent this sub often, you're probably quite familiar with Greger's work, so I'll assume he needs no introduction. I thought it would be useful for my own reference as well as others if I wrote out all of Greger's Daily Dozen, which is a sort of checklist of foods that he recommends people eat on a daily basis. He gives serving sizes for all the different food groups and has a list of recommended foods from each group that have strong clinical evidence for nutritional benefits. 

I’ve taken his Daily Dozen and written it all out in a single place for easier viewing. Greger has made videos covering the benefits of most of the foods that he recommends, so I’ve hyperlinked all of the video resources. 

I looked into how many calories the Dozen is, as well as how much it would cost to shop for, and it comes out to approximately $6 a day and 1400 calories, depending on which foods you choose, so there’s still room for a nice treat of your choosing. I think this dispels the myth that eating healthy food is prohibitively expensive. 

I'm not gonna get into the whole plant-based vs omnivore debate (I'm sure someone else will), but looking into these different foods and their benefits really made it extra apparent how ridiculous the carnivore diet claims are. You have to be in serious denial to blow off this much overwhelming evidence that supports plant foods being good for the body.

Do calories have the same effect if eaten all at once or spread out over time?,"I'm looking for a nutritional science take on this aspect of dieting.

Let's say I allow myself a pack of cookies per week (this is an example, it could be a pack of yogurt cups or an entire cake).

From a fat loss perspective, presuming the rest of the diet &amp; exercise stayed exactly the same, would it matter if I ate it all at once, over 2 sittings, or evenly throughout the week?

My thinking is that it makes no difference, since the average calories throughout the week would be the same - that is, there would be a surplus on the day I ate them, but their absence from the other days would cause an equivalent caloric deficit, meaning the same overall amount of fat gain/loss. In short, that there is a ""simple"", linear, and essentially isolated relationship between calories eaten and calories burned.

Am I wrong?",nutrition,1550716728,mynamemyplane,2,2,True,2019-02-20

How much if any of this is true about Blood Types and food?,"I am mainly wondering about ""Lectins""  and agglutination  of cells.  Does any of this make any sense?

I know the Blood Type Diet is almost all pseudo science.  IS there any truth to the information I posted below?

Sorry, I know its alot to read!  Just skim through it!  Can this be disproven or debunked?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A chemical reaction occurs between your blood and the foods you eat. This reaction is part of your genetic inheritance. It is amazing but true that today, in the twenty first century, your immune and digestive systems still maintain favoritism for foods that your blood type ancestors ate.

We know this because of a factor called **lectins.** Lectins, abundant and diverse proteins found in foods, have agglutinating properties that affect your blood and the lining of your digestive tract. Lectins are a powerful way for organisms in nature to attach themselves to other organisms in nature. Lots of germs, and even our own immune systems, use this super glue to their benefit. For example, cells in our liver's bile ducts have lectins on their surfaces to help snatch up bacteria and parasites. Bacteria and other microbes have lectins on their surfaces as well, which work rather like suction cups, so that they can attach to the slippery mucosal linings of the body. Often the lectins used by viruses or bacteria can be blood type specific, making them a stickier pest for people of that blood type.

&amp;#x200B;

 Lectins are abundant proteins, found in foods. Their agglutinating properties affect blood and other tissues, organs, and body systems. **If you eat a food that has protein lectins that are incompatible with your blood-type antigen, they attack an organ or system and begin to agglutinate cells in that area.** Many food lectins are close enough to a certain blood-type antigen so as to make that food detrimental to another type. For example, milk has B-like qualities. If a type A drinks milk, agglutination begins immediately to reject it. Cells in the target area are clumped together and destroyed. However, there is some protection from lectins. Our immune system actually sloughs off 95% of the lectins in our food. The other 5% can cause problems if a particular blood type is reactive.

&amp;#x200B;

 So, too, with the lectins in food. Simply put, when you eat a food containing protein lectins that are incompatible with your blood type antigen, the lectins target an organ or bodily system (kidneys, liver, gut, stomach, etc.) and can begin to interact with the tissues in that area.  **This is  ""agglutination ""**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Blood Types and Health

Our blood type is significant for our health because of three classes of chemicals—antigens, antibodies, and lectins. An antigen is any chemical that generates an antibody by the immune system in response to it. An antibody is a substance, an ""immunoglobulin,"" made by cells of the immune system specifically to identify foreign material in the body of the host and to adhere to the foreign material. A lectin is any compound, usually a protein, found in nature, which can interact with surface antigens found on the body’s cells causing them to agglutinate or clump together.

Antigens and antibodies

As far as antigens are concerned, we each have a variety of our own that enable the immune system to decide whether a substance in the body is foreign or not. They are located on the cells of the body. Every form of life from the simplest virus to human beings has a unique set of antigens. In the human body one of the most powerful of these is the one that determines blood type. When the immune system senses a suspicious invader it looks first to the blood type antigen to decide whether or not it is friendly. Our blood type is named for the blood type antigen found on the red blood cells. Thus, type A has A antigen, type B has B antigen, type AB has both A and B antigens, and type O has no antigens.

When a blood-type antigen senses that a foreign antigen has entered the system, it alerts the immune system to create antibodies to that antigen. Immune system cells manufacture these antibodies, which attach themselves to the foreign antigen for destruction. Over time we develop an increasing number of different antibodies. When an antibody meets the antigen of a bacteria or virus or parasite it causes the microorganism to become sticky or agglutinate. The organisms clump up and can be disposed of more easily.

Besides detecting and destroying microbes and other invaders, there are other important aspects of blood-type antigens with their resulting antibodies. About a hundred years ago, an Austrian physician and scientist, Dr. Karl Landsteiner, discovered that blood types produced antibodies to other blood types. This explains why some people can exchange blood and others can’t. Thus, blood-type A carries antibodies against type B. Type B carries antibodies against type A. Type AB carries no antibodies against either type A or type B. Type O carries antibodies against both type A and type B. Anti-blood-type antibodies are extremely powerful and can clump (agglutinate) blood cells of the opposing type in seconds. Unlike most other antibodies that require some sort of stimulation, for example, vaccination or infection, for their production, blood-type antibodies appear automatically at birth and, by four months of age, have attained almost adult levels.

In addition to blood-cell agglutination by anti-blood-type antibodies, it was found that many foods agglutinate the cells of certain blood types but not of others. A food that may be harmful to the cells of one blood type may be beneficial to the cells of another. Many of the antigens in these foods have A-like or B-like characteristics. This discovery led to the link between blood type and diet.

"Oils and how to store them to prevent oxidation...? (Bottle air tight ""seal"")?","Hello. I have bought and will be buying different kinds of oils as supplement for health and nutrition, all of which have omegas in them and are prone to ""quick"" degredation on air. I mean once you open the bottle and let the air in, these oils start to degarde a LOT faster than in an UNopened bottle. The process is called oxidation i think :-). THe ""oils"" i have in mind are concretely - Pumpkin Seed Oil, Black Currant Seed Oil and Fish Oil. I want to save money per ""serving"" and thus i want to buy at least 250 ml bottle of each of these oil supplements. I think the basic recomendation is to store them in cool places without access of light (fridge or freezer). But even in these conditions when the bottle is opened the general recomdentation is to use the bottle in 3 months. I wont be able to do that, i want each bottle to last longer, at least twice longer (that means at least 6 months and rather 8 if possible...). The date of expiration of UNopened bottles are smth over a year i believe. But once opened only 3 months. I got a tip how how to prolong the life of the oils (without them being oxidized) from some online shop owner selling these oils. He told me to pour the content of the 250 ml straight after 1st opening into smaller bottles (like 5 x 50 ml bottles), fill the bottle maximally up to the bottleneck leaving as small room for air as possible). And then SEAL all these smaller 50 ml bottles AIR tight with SOMETHING. The question is with WHAT...?

I know i have to use glass bottles with narrow bottleneck and brown/black glass. But what type of ""plug, cork, stopper"" , ""bottle cap"" (im not sure by the proper word - im not native english speaker) should i use...? Or  what technique...? Should i use standard cork? Rubber cork? Some plastic or synthethic (silicon?) material cork...? Or should i use ""glass"" cork (not sure about the correct term in english). like this:

What about using something - anything and then ""sealing"" the edge of the bottle and the ""cap"" by wax - like normal wax made from burning home candle...? ANd in addition covering the bottle neck with the cap with additional layer of Plasticine (the one kids play with)?

Simply what would you recommend, what cap and/or technique to make a small bottle with its content as air tight as possible in home conditions...? (i dont have access to any special equipment)...?

Chia seeds and omega-3: Overdose concerns,"Chia seeds are a convenient source of vitamin K (just 10 grams of seeds = ~71 µg vit. K = ~60% of RDA), but the concentration of omega-3 is even higher (10 g seeds = 1.8 g omega-3 = ~111% of RDA), which makes me wonder whether eating them and e.g. mackerel or salmon on the same day is a bad idea, assuming the omega-3 total shoots up to, let's say, 300% or more of RDA. Steering clear of mackerel or salmon is not a very tempting idea, since they are great sources of vitamin D.

To what extent would you push the limit in terms of daily omega-3 intake?

Please critique my diet,"Hey guys, I have hit 200lbs last month and since then did away with most of my junk food habits, I have been following this diet since the past 20 days or so. I recently came to know how unhealthy a glass of orange juice is. And this made me wonder if there is something else I have been doing wrong the entire time without knowing, so I am posting my daily dietary schedule, please let me know if there's any changes and advice guys. Thanks a lot in advance.  


Breakfast (8am) : 

omelette (2 eggs beaten and mixed with a spoonful of guacamole) 

2 slices of toasted bread or fruit (banana or apple)

A glass of orange juice (walmart) or a glass of milk

Lunch : 

A handful of dried fruits and nuts like almonds, walnuts, cashew etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Dinner : 

Light fried Brocolli and ginger (about 10 crowns)

Now that I've realized that orange juice is basically just as harmful as soda, I will replace it with just plain milk everyday. Is that alright?

"Study: Microbiome restoration diet improves digestion, cognition and physical and emotional wellbeing. Diet employs a large variety of fruits and vegetables that contain prebiotic substances. Participants’ primary goal was weight-loss, the cognitive and emotional improvements were a surprise","Microbiome restoration diet improves digestion, cognition and physical and emotional wellbeing


Abstract

Manipulating gut bacteria in the microbiome, through the use of probiotics and prebiotics, has been found to have an influence on both physical and emotional wellbeing. This study uses a dietary manipulation ‘The Gut Makeover’ designed to elicit positive changes to the gut bacteria within the microbiome. 21 healthy participants undertook ‘The Gut Makeover’ for a four week period. Weight and various aspects of health were assessed pre and post intervention using the Functional Medicine Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ). **Paired sample t-tests revealed a significant reduction in self-reported weight at the end of the intervention. Adverse medical symptoms related to digestion, cognition and physical and emotional wellbeing, were also significantly reduced** during the course of the dietary intervention. The intervention, designed to manipulate gut bacteria, had a significant impact on digestion, reducing IBS type symptoms in this non-clinical population. There was also a striking reduction in negative symptoms related to cognition, memory and emotional wellbeing, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. 

Dietary gut microbiome manipulations may have the power to exert positive physical and psychological health benefits, of a similar nature to those reported in studies using pre and probiotics. The small sample size and lack of control over confounding variables means that it will be important to replicate these findings in larger-scale controlled, prospective, clinical trials. This dietary microbiome intervention has the potential to improve physical and emotional wellbeing in the general population but also to be investigated as a treatment option for individuals with conditions as diverse as IBS, anxiety, depression and Alzheimer’s disease.

Question about Fat (as a macro nutrient),"Hello all,

Quick background. Diagnosed with Crohns years ago. Recently had surgery removing terminal ilium and ileocecal valve. Basically, the area that re absorbs bile acid back into body. 

I am on medication to bind the acid together. However, I’m attempting to gain weight by eating in a caloric surplus. I’ve noticed that when I eat a high amount of fat on any given day, 40 percent of daily calories and up, I still have loose stools, numerous times a day. 

Now I believe your body releases more bile acid to digest and break down fat, right? 

If my thinking is correct, the high amount of fat I’m consuming could be contributing to my problems, even while on the medicine (Questran)? 

I went back to my food log and have noticed that o have really good days when my fat is below 95g grams (or roughly 30 percent of daily calories).

New study shows High Fat diets are harmful to the gut microbiome and leads to inflammation....Or does it,"So a new 6 month study with 217 healthy individuals came out a few days ago. They put the people into 3 groups which were high fat diet, moderate fat, and low fat. They all ate the same amount of calories just the fats and carbs were different. Study posted below.

[https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2019/01/18/gutjnl-2018-317609](https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2019/01/18/gutjnl-2018-317609) 

After 6 months what they found was that the high fat diet group had unfavourable changes on the gut microbiota and inflammatory factors. They also mentioned this could lead to negative long term health issues.

BUT you need to read the fine print. First of all the high fat diet was only 40% fat. Now call me crazy but a diet that is 40% fat I wouldn't call a high fat diet.

They used Soybean Oil as the main fat source for the high fat group. Up to 24% of their total calories came from soybean oil. High amounts of soybean oil is pro inflammatory. They even admitted to this but it's buried all the way at the bottom. Here is a quote

""It should be noted that the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was relatively high in the higher-fat diet group (24% of total energy) owing to exclusive use of soybean oil, which is rich in n-6 PUFA. A higher intake of n-6 PUFA has been reported to have proinflammatory effects.""

Outlets are already running with this such as Webmd who posted this- [https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20190220/high-fat-diets-do-no-favors-for-your-gut-bacteria#1](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20190220/high-fat-diets-do-no-favors-for-your-gut-bacteria#1) 

I have no foot in this race. I'm not someone who eats a high fat diet but I don't like misleading things like this. The ""high fat diet"" wasn't even high fat and they fed them crazy amounts of soybean oil. Are we really surprised at the results. ",nutrition,1550813469,flaxseed1,56,244,True,2019-02-22

Help with a non-grain and gluten-free diet for muscle growth.,"I have a panic disorder so I want to try and eat a non-grain and gluten-free diet. I’ve come to the conclusion that sugars and gluten should be avoided in my diet. This rules out grains.

If I have meats and normally 2-3 sides with my meat each plate with exercise I’m confused as to what is now supposed to go on my plate as sides with the meat that’s non-grain and gluten-free to fill me up and equally grow muscle/weight. 

Can anybody suggest anything or any useful website, YouTube channels etc that align with this new goal of mine, which I’d like to make life long. Anything helps.

Beans may be the very best thing you can eat for your microbiome. Here is why.,"First off beans are the cornerstone for every blue zone diet in the world

https://www.bluezones.com/2016/06/10-things-about-beans/

So there's that. But for the microbiome they are incredible. First understand how important Resistant starch is for the microbiome.

https://www.dermveda.com/articles/why-you-should-eat-resistant-starch-for-a-healthy-microbiome

&gt;Resistant starch is metabolized by microbes in the gut to produce molecules called short chain fatty acids, such as acetate, butyrate and propionate. These short chain fatty acids have significant health benefits, including cancer fighting benefits and anti-inflammatory effects.[4,5] Diets high in resistant starch lead to higher levels of short chain fatty acids and may offer protection against colon inflammation and disease.[6] The dietary fiber that is fermented by our gut microorganisms are referred to as “prebiotics,” leading to the production of beneficial short chain fatty acids and other molecules, including serotonin and deoxycholic acid.[7,8]

&gt;Eating resistant starch may even improve problems with insulin regulation, including insulin resistance and diabetes.[9]

https://www.gutmicrobiotaforhealth.com/en/new-review-explores-latest-knowledge-resistant-starch-nutrition-modulator-gut-microbiota/

&gt;In addition, RS (resistant starch) has specific beneficial effects on the gut environment including increased populations of Ruminococcus bromii -a dominant member of the phylum Firmicutes that plays a primary role in releasing energy from dietary starches that escape digestion by host enzymes through its exceptional activity against particulate resistant starches. Besides this, ingestion of food products rich in RS has been shown to increase luminal short-chain fatty acid levels, modulate microbial metabolism and improve markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity

&gt;Regarding cell signalling pathways that can explain physiological effects of RS, using animal models it has been well documented that **resistant starch has strong anti-inflammatory properties**

And beans are far and away the best source of resistant starch in our diets. They have many more times the RS as any other commonly eaten food. See here for more.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2015/11/16/ask-the-expert-legumes-and-resistant-starch/

Eating beans may even alter the microbiome in such a way as to kill cancer cells!

https://www.healio.com/gastroenterology/oncology/news/online/%7B1d9afc8b-cef1-4b45-94bc-61dbfc08144b%7D/rice-bran-navy-beans-boost-gut-microbiome-slow-crc-cell-growth

&gt;To evaluate the chemopreventive effects of rice bran and navy bean intake, Ryan and colleagues performed a phase 2 pilot study (the BENEFIT trial), in which they randomly assigned 29 CRC survivors to consume 30 grams of rice bran per day, 35 grams of navy bean powder per day, or neither for 4 weeks.

&gt;They found that increased consumption of rice bran and navy beans led to higher dietary levels of fiber, iron, zinc, thiamin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, and alpha-tocopherol. Further, stool microbiome analyses revealed the rice bran group had increased gut microbial richness and diversity, and the navy bean group showed increased gut microbial richness.

&gt;Notably, analysis of human stool metabolite extracts before and after the dietary intervention showed increased intake of rice bran or navy beans reduced growth of colorectal cancer cells.

Need advice on whether I can take these supplements together or not?,"Hi all, first time poster, any advice would be much appreciated. Not sure if this is the right place to ask but here goes...

So I currently have,
Omega 3 fish oil capsules (1200mg of which 663mg of EPA/DHA), reccomended one capsule with food. I play sports and take it for joints.

ABC Plus multivitamins and minerals, one capsule with food. For overall health.

Magnesium Citrate 400mg, 2 capsules with food. For reducing anxiety and helping sleep better at night etc as I struggle to nod off at times.

Now I usually take all 3 supplements (total of 4 capsules) at once with my evening meal. Is that alright? I can't really spread them out with other meals as I am not as consistent with other meals during the day and I'm not always at home.

Do eating or drinking milk products make sense for adults?,"First time I visit this website, so I'm sorry if I'm asking something dumb or whatnot. But I just came here to ask this question that came to my mind while laying in bed.

So here is my thoughts process:

1) I remember reading about a study that says that a person's amount of bone problems, or the lack of it, is directly proportional to how much milk they drank up until age ~16. I read that more than 10 years ago while the study is more than double my age old. So I probably can't find it, sorry.

2) I know that almost all animals are lactose intolerant when adults? Meaning that ingesting milk products, as Adults, is unique to humans alone? And even for humans - the Asian race is lactose intolerant too.

3) Cheese and butter are generally said to be unhealthy. But they are just milk.

So, after all that, I have to ask. Do milk products have any nutritional value at all that would make them ""good"" or worthwhile?

Bonus question. Ok, I know this very very likely very very dumb idea. But since the ""white people"" race only about 3000 years old and also only humans drink milk as adults. Could those 2 things be connected? Because... you know... white color? :D

P.S. I'm really hoping I didn't break any rules, since I just marched in here, without reading anything first, and just submit my post with my question. :P

Why aren’t pomegranates more of a thing?,"So there are a couple studies out there it seems starting about 10-15 years ago suggesting that regular consumption of pomegranates or pomegranate juice can actually reduce the thickness of atherosclerosis plaques.  It seems like there were a number of these with relatively similar results.  It would seem to me as a layperson that every cardiologist in the country would be urging everybody to eat/drink pomegranate today as a prophylaxis against heart disease.  It seems however, that the chief place this gets touted is on websites with questionable scientific rigor behind their claims.  Likewise, although there are these limited studies showing clinical results in humans as well as animal/test tube studies suggesting the same, I’ve never seen anything that’s a long term, large population human study looking at long term clinical outcomes of pomegranate consumption.

So what am I missing here?  As far as I can tell I’ve never seen anything showing that pomegranates are a fad “miracle cure” without validity, only that more study is necessary to draw firm conclusions.

&gt;When it comes to carbs, your best nutrition strategy might be the oldest one in the book: moderation.

&gt;That’s according to a new study published in The Lancet Public Health, which finds that people who get about half of their total calories from carbohydrates may be at a lower risk of early death than those who follow either very high- or very low-carb diets. The researchers estimated that people who ate a moderate amount of carbohydrates at age 50 had a life expectancy of around 83, compared to 82 for high-carb eaters and 79 for low-carb eaters.

Pistachios and melatonin.,"What up /r/nutrition. A few months ago I watched a [YouTube video by the ever-controversial Michael Greger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DeTN-fci_4) about the melatonin content of natural foods, namely pistachios.

He points out that a small amount of pistachios (I think two?) have the melatonin content of most supplements. I've found this info in a few other sources as well, nothing super reputable.

I've been suffering from insomnia lately and trying to get my sleep schedule back on track, but most sleep aids make me feel horrible the next day, including melatonin in pill form. I also don't want to become dependent on sleep aids.

Twice this week I've tried to have pistachios before bed (way more than two, probably about 50-75 grams per night) and I have found it a bit easier to fall asleep but not noticeably so, and certainly not as much as a sleep aid would. So quite possibly just a placebo thing.

I'm kind of just wondering if anyone here has experience eating pistachios (or other melatonin-rich foods) to help with sleep or can point out any reason why they wouldn't.

For example, I'm sort of thinking that straight melatonin vs melatonin stored in plant fats would affect the body totally differently. I used to eat pistachios every day with my lunch in college and don't recall ever passing out at my desk, though mid-day grogginess was common during that time cuz college sleeping schedule.

I started experiencing chronic fatigue, depression, anxiety, digestive problems, IBS and muscle and joint pain. I started breaking out with deep red inflamed cysts on my face and few on my back, which I’ve never dealt with before. 

I started researching online and asking people and realised my acne is hormone related and there is a correlation between nutrition and hormones and immune system. I’ve also  came across Candida overgrowth and nearly all symptoms matched mine, I’ve since cut out gluten, sugar and carbs. I understand that the medical field doesn’t recognise Candida as a real health condition, so I won’t be asking for any advice about this. 

I would like to know how I can  bring my hormones back to normal and boost up a possible low immune system. My diet is the first step which includes a lot of veg protein and probiotic foods, but what else should I be doing?

The confusion of Sugar and Salt why be afraid of one and not the other?,"I am not a doctor, nutritionist or other health professional. Can someone please explain this recent increase in people recommending people eat large amounts of saturated fat and salt but yet being so afraid of sugar?


•Sugar

Sugar as we all know is not a health food, every camp of diet, expert and their grandmother knows that overconsumption of sugars will lead to negative fitness and health outcomes. 

For all the science addicts here’s a study just to cement the fact https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18551017/    Yes it is in rats but you can’t feed humans to intentionally make them sick .

Who recommends eating sugar? Nobody.

•Salt 

Salt or sodium is a vital mineral for the body which maintains a tight balance of this electrolyte, You’re friend says they read an article on Facebook that you should drink upwards of 3-4L of water every day even if your not thirsty or exercising? Wrong you’ll end up in the ER especially if you are on a low salt diet/ no processed food diet (Always consult your doctor/ nutritionist not Facebook) 

Salt is also discouraged by every professional institution as it is linked to autoimmune and cardiovascular disease and gastric cancer.

I don’t want this to be my crutch. I have began taking back my health working out and gaining muscle. Everything was fine but I decided to stop smoking and sure enough my appetite plummets. I’ll feel the effects of needing nutrition but every time I try to eat I just want to vomit my face off.

You might even be wondering, are you going to be like them one day? Is there any chance for you to change? Of course there is. However, summer body doesn’t come with ease.

Many work their butt off to attain their dream body. But, what is important is, you are healthy from the inside out. When I say fat burn, the first thing that comes into your mind is exercise. Yes, of course you need to exercise to have a nice summer body. But, do you know that our eating habit affects our body the most? Have you ever heard that weight loss is 80% Diet, 20% Exercise? I beg to differ.

Diet can actually make up as much as 90-99% of your weight loss journey. The MAIN reason why you’re fat is because of your lifestyle! Having an unhealthy lifestyle not only slows down your metabolism but also brings you chronic diseases. With a slow metabolic system, you can even gain weight by only drinking water! This is also the reason why some people slim down at a very slow rate but gain all the weight back in one night.

Can Baking be Nutritious?,"Hi all,  

&amp;#x200B;

Baking usually includes many products that I personally try to avoid (refined sugar and flour). However, my better half   enjoys baking. What are everyone's thoughts on baking if we replace many of the bad products with some more   nutritious alternatives. For instance, buckwheat/coconut/almond flour instead of white flour and replace refined sugar   with homemade date syrup (water and dates) and fruit (bananas/berries).    

Of course, we will still be careful with overall caloric intake, but I wanted to see what people's opinions are on whether   this can be fit comfortably into a healthy lifestyle.     

I also wanted to see if anyone else does this and if it satisfies their 'itch'?

Everyone is aware that there are no long term studies on just eating meat - its a risk but if you feel better than you ever have in your life, why not go for it?

"Comparing different types of oils (Olive, Canola, Avocado, Sunflower)","First of all, let me say that I do not believe that oil of any kind is a health food. Oils are processed foods by definition and should therefore be used in strict moderation as they offer very little nutrition in regard to their extreme caloric content.

Now there exists a lot of confusion about the 'healthfulness' of different types of oil. Extra virgin olive oil is generally believed to be the best choice. Canola is often made out to be the devil because it's too industrial and associated with levels of trans fat, or because it has been subject to biotechnological interventions. Then there is avocado oil, which is supposedly better, and sunflower oil, which is seen as inferior due to its high omega-6 content.

So I thought I'd compare all there oils and look at their fatty acid composition, omega ratios and vitamin content. Because sunflower oil will definitely get bashed for its omega-6 content, I will use high-oleic sunflower oil in this comparison.

I use data from the nutrition facts labels in my local supermarket, supplemented with data from the NCCDB. These numbers can differ depending on the country where the oil crops are grown and what cultivars are used.

|per 100 grams|EV Olive oil|Canola oil|Avocado oil|HO Sunflower oil|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Monounsat. fat (n-9)|76 g|59 g|70.6 g|**83.7** g|
|Omega-3|0.5 g|**7.4** g|0.9 g|0.2 g|
|Omega-6|6.0 g|17.6 g|12.5 g|**3.6** g|
|Saturated fat|14.0 g|**6.0** g|11.6 g|9.9 g|
|Trans fat|0.2 g|0.4 g|**0.0** g|0.1 g|
|Vitamin E|18 mg|30 mg|12.6 mg|**41.1** mg|
|Vitamin K|60 mg|**112.5** mg|91.4 mg|5.4 mg|

I've marked the numbers that scored best for each category according to the 'consensus', which appears to be less saturated fat and omega-6, and more vitamins and omega-3.

&amp;#x200B;

So what does /r/nutrition think? Let's have a discussion.

**Does EV olive oil live up to its reputation?**

**Thoughts on canola oil?**

**Where do avocado and HO sunflower oil stand in this comparison?**

**How does heat affect the quality of these oils?**

Last chance to comment on 2030 food and nutrition objectives,"For those of you who care about US nutrition policy -

I went to Marion Nestle's blog today [www.foodpolitics.com](https://www.foodpolitics.com) and was reminded that the Department of Health and Human Services is collecting comments on draft objectives until **January 17.** 

From her website: 

&gt;The endlessly repeating process of defining health goals for the next ten years continues and the Department of Health and Human Services is now (or will be when the shutdown ends) collecting comments on draft objectives.  
&gt;  
&gt;You can see the list of categories [here](https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/About-Healthy-People/Development-Healthy-People-2030/Public-Comment/topics-objectives).  
&gt;  
&gt;That site also has links to the history of the objectives (which dates to 1979) and how the whole process works.  
&gt;  
&gt;The point of the objectives is to set highly specific, measurable goals for health improvement, so that progress toward attaining the goals (or the lack thereof) can be tracked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here, for example, are the first two in the Nutrition section:  
&gt;  
&gt;NWS-2030-01: Reduce household food insecurity and in doing so reduce hunger  
&gt;  
&gt;NWS-2030-02: Reduce the proportion of adults who have obesity  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem: the process does not define ***how*** these goals are to be accomplished or ***who*** is responsible for accomplishing them.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the scorekeeping is useful and the deadline for weighing on on the proposed objectives is **January 17.**

Advice on vitamins I'm planning to take,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

No special condition. I am overweight and often times lack energy. Like many, looking to make a change this year that sticks. Part of what I'd like to do is get into the steady habit of taking vitamins. I've had vitamin D deficiency in the past. Here is what I'm thinking for vitamins. Please let me know if anything stands out in this mix of medications: 

&amp;#x200B;

 Vitamin D3 (2 tablets, = 2,000 IU) 

B-Complex w/ Follic Acid 

Vitamin C w/ Rose Hips (1,000 mg + the 120 mg of Vitamin c absorbic acid that comes with the B complex. Total Vitamin C = 1,120mg) 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound ok? I'm also considering adding a woman's one a day. Is there a danger or an advantage in this? It would add 120mg more of Vitamin C, 1,000 IU of Vitamin D, and 3,500 IU of Vitamin A. If I do this, should I only take one Vitamin D3 tablet? So the total doesn't go to 3,000 IU?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance. I'm new to nutrition and planning and I would appreciate the input.

Another [source](http://www.berkeleywellness.com/healthy-eating/nutrition/article/there-daily-omega-3-recommendation) states that the adequate intake of omega 3 is 1,1g for women and 1,6g for men.

&amp;#x200B;

Either the math doesn't add up, or I'm missing something. Is there a consensus of how much omega 3 and 6 one should be eating? What would be be the long term consequences of eating less far less omega 6 than the requirement mentioned above while maintaining a reasonable balance with omega 3?

Yeast intolerance and probiotics?,"I recently had a food intolerance test, and though I know it’s not an exact science, I’ve been dealing with frequent mouth ulcers, and other inflammations, so I did the test for some potential clues before an elimination diet. 

I came up with all dairy, eggs and yeast, and I’m fairly certain after accidentally falling off the wagon twice with yeast and experiencing negative symptoms that I do have a yeast intolerance. But I’m s bit confused about probiotics.

prior to my test I’d been drinking coconut kefir and home made ginger beer and they seemed to relive those bad symptoms, but aren’t probiotics yeast? Does this suggest I need to focus more on types of yeast or is there something else I’m missing here?

Living on 500kcal/day – how to manage micronutrients?,"All right, let's get one thing straight. I know living on 500 kcal a day is stupid and might be dangerous. But that is, unfortunately, the premise.

I have tried losing weight for over five years, but always failed for various reasons, most of them having to do with lack of discipline. You named it, I've tried it.

One day, I noticed that I couldn't fit in a pair of trousers I desperately needed to wear in a week's time. As a desperate measure, I decided to eat four Nutrilette shake powder bags in 38% cream every other day (totalling ~1000kcal) and fast every other day. This is obviously madness, and I fully expected this to fail, but hopefully not before getting into those trousers.

This was a month ago. By some freak chance, this insane diet doesn't make me a hungry wreck. Sure, I'm hungry, but it's bearable in a way no other diet has been before. I lose half a kilogramme of body weight a day and I feel perfectly fine doing it, and I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth by starting to eat more. I tried, once, but then I got hungrier, so I stopped. So 1000kcal every other day is the premise.

With that said, I'm aware I'm lacking quite a lot of micronutrients doing this. How can I change this diet as little as possible to cover the micronutrients I'm bound to be lacking at this point?

(I'll edit in a table of the nutrients I'm currently taking in later, I don't have that information available right now.)",nutrition,1547820140,konaya,0,1,True,2019-01-18

I'm allergic to fish and seafood so I decided to start taking Omega-3 supplements (today to be exact lol).

Wheat Belly!!!,"Inflammation + weight gain + headaches + arthritis + high blood sugar. 

What do all these have in common?

Wheat. 

A few health problems, affecting you and your family.

It makes up the bulk calories of most American diets. 

33% are obese 33% are overweight 33% are normal.

What category do you fall into? 

People are getting fatter and fatter every year. 

Wheat got started 10,000 years ago. Since then it has gone through sooo many genetic mutations!!

Mutations to increase yield + lower production cost. 

Cereal, granola, pizza, bread.
Cut it off completely. 

Wheat affects every organ in your body! 

GYLCATION- irreversible protein change in your blood stream, attaches to tissues + joints + knees + collagen

For you LADIES. Your skin is made up of collagen. 

The more gylcation happens, more collagen gets attack = saggier skin + wrinkles + crows feet.... Bye bye beautiful. 

Gylcation speeds up your biological age. 

High blood sugar (cause by wheat) = gylcation. 

Byproduct of glycation is inflammation. Inflammation is responsible for heart disease/ cancer/ diabetes. 

The fatter you get, the more health problems you have. 

Visceral fat becomes it own organ, producing estrogen and inflammation. 

Autoimmunity + high triglycerides are caused by wheat. 

I didn't scratch the surface of what health ailments await to those who continue to eat wheat. 

Dr. William Davis. God bless his soul. 
Not only is this book enjoyable. It'll blow your mind and boggle your reality about wheat.

The six less famous micronutrients.,"The two big nutrient databases I'm aware of—the National Nutrient Database and the Nutrition Coordinating Center Food &amp; Nutrient Database—are excellent but, as far as I know, don't list quantitative data on EVERY micronutrient in every food.  Do you agree with me so far, or am I missing something?

Moreover, I feel those databases are weak when it comes to six micronutrients in particular: vitamin K, chromium, copper, fluoride, manganese, and molybdenum.  Do you agree?

If you're with me so far, then kindly tell me what, if anything, you consult to learn how much of those six vitamins and minerals you consume.  They seldom appear on nutrition labels.

Of course, not knowing this almost surely doesn't mean most of our diets critically lack vitamins or minerals.  Most of our diets are all right in that regard, I understand, even if we don't know the numbers.

Nevertheless, I think it'd only make sense to optimize/manage those micros if possible, as many of us do for macros.  Active management can't hurt, and in theory it might help in some small manner (e.g., for some people, being able to shave off a tiny bit more of their calorie intake; for others, gaining slightly more freedom to adjust diets or macro ratios; and so on).  If we only had the raw data.

So, do you have any ideas about where to look up such data, especially for vitamin K, chromium, copper, fluoride, manganese, and molybdenum?  Is there a better resource than the two databases I mentioned, by any chance?

Thank you.",nutrition,1547929313,JSanzi,31,1,True,2019-01-19
Honey vs Yacon Syrup vs Monk fruit,"I am trying to quit processed sugar and artificial sweeteners as well. I recently heard the importance of the microbiome and how my habit of artificial sweeteners is probably altering it. For now, I still take 2 packet twin sugar per day (via coffee) and I know that my current protein powder has also artificial sweetener.    

I looked into alternatives for this and found Honey, Yacon syrup and Monk fruit powder. The last 2 are very hard to come by in Canada and seem to be super expensive. I was wondering how bad is it to take 2 to 4 tsp of honey / day (via green tea or coffee) noting that this is the only source of processed sugar I take? Would it really be better for my microbiome to switch to erythritol because every one seems to be switching to it?

A few weeks in and I generally feel great, but I and am experiencing a lot of acne and..ahem...bowl movements. Raw vegan enthusiasts, who are a decidedly quacky bunch, swear up and down that this diet of “detox” is normal. The argument is not unique to this way of eating. I’ve heard it in paleo, Keto, Atkins, circles as well. The argument typically goes “the body stores toxins and when you start eating the ‘right’ way, it can finally process them and they come out through your stool and your skin.” Is this a load of steamy pseudoscience shit? The NIH has an article stating that “There isn’t any convincing evidence that detox or cleansing programs actually remove toxins from your body or improve your health.” My question for this community: is there ANY evidence we can point to or evaluate whether “detoxification” in the body is actually a thing?

Milk and Oats,"Not sure this post is within the rules because, frankly, they are a little to complicated for what is supposed to be a platform for communication in a forum.

Anyway, 60lbs weight loss this year.  Looking to rebuild my diet for weight lifting and muscle growth.  The calorie restrictive diet is very clean and void of processed foods, etc.  As I move to gaining muscle weight was looking to add calories with whole milk, oats, and fish.  I feel these are missing from my diet but I keep reading articles and books (Dr. Hyman) bashing oats and milk.  I get the feeling most of this stuff is written from the perspective of most people will not exercise enough or not at all.  Would the advice on milk and oats change if used properly for muscle growth?  All this reading comes down on eating more protein for breakfast and less carb.  However, when I just take on protein for breakfast my workouts don't have the same ""pop"" as when I get some oats in me.

I understand oats are a carb and spike insulin.  Honestly I don't care.  I lost 60lbs managing the calories in - calories out formula.  I eat tons of Quaker Quick Oats (not the sugar stuff).  I grew up on skim, but understand it doesn't have the healthy fats for absorption, etc.  Hate oats with water.  I can see why people don't want to go for this stuff if you're not working out and still want to maintain or decrease weight.  Or you just want to do cardio.

Never tried Apple Cider Vinegar as a natural remedy?," 

So the other day I was feeling very much under the weather, running nose, chest tightness and a little bit of fatigue. Not too excited about the idea that I was going to be getting or already had a cold. I knew it was time for one of my go-to remedies. After mix two teaspoons with 8 ounces of water, I drank it before bed and in the morning I felt like myself Once you get used to the taste, it’s all gravy from there!

***Apple Cider Vinegar!!!!!!***

This brownish liquid that doesn’t taste too wonderful or smell too great but can do wonders for our health. Apple cider vinegar is a vinegar made from fermented apple juice, it’s used in salad dressings, marinades, vinaigrettes, food preservatives, and chutneys. It is made by first crushing apples and squeezing out the liquid. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_cider_vinegar)

If you’re wondering what the fuss about this magical natural liquid is all about. I’ve done some research on apple cider vinegar benefits and put this list together for you.

When drinking ACV it’s best to drink through a straw to protect the enamel on your teeth. Here are some of the cool uses for ACV for health.

## 1. Lowers Levels

Apple cider vinegar can help you lower your blood sugar and blood pressure levels. This happens because of the acidity in the vinegar lowers glucose levels. Mixing a little ACV with water before you eat a meal is the way to go. [Want to learn more?](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/11/2814.full)

**2. Cure Symptoms of the Common Cold**

ACV can help with a sore throat, once you start to get that scratchy feeling in your throat add a tablespoon to an 8 oz glass of water and sip. ACV also creates an alkaline environment that helps kill bacteria and viruses. It’s a natural immunity booster too.

**3. Aids in Weightloss**

 If you are looking to lose a little weight, I suggest drinking a few tablespoons mixed with water. ACV can reduce appetite, lower blood sugar, reduce fat storage, and improve metabolism.

**4. Boosts Energy**

Need a natural energy boost, try sipping ACV with water.

**5. Acne**

Apple Cider Vinger can improve your skin, use as a toner or astringent. ACV has properties that restore the PH balance of your skin and cleanses your skin. Make sure to mix with water to dilute. Just a tiny bit works. Also if you leave a little on acne or spots overnight, it can help reduce their appearance.

**6. Tummy Problems**

Feeling bloated or gassy, some claim ACV can aid in these digestion issues. It increases stomach acid production and that helps break down what we ingest. To ease heartburn mix apple cider vinegar with baking soda and water.

**8. Eliminates Candida Overgrowth**

Apple Cide Vinegar has natural antifungal and antibacterial properties and this is bad for Candida. Candida is a group of yeasts that can cause infections in different parts of the body. What ACV does is help fight intestinal yeasts you may be getting from eating [harmful foods](https://www.amymyersmd.com/2016/07/9-foods-to-avoid-if-you-have-candida/), this controls the overgrowth of yeasts in your body.

Nutritional/low-cal Multicultural Recipes,"

Hello! I wanted to join this group and ask if anyone has diet/low calorie recipes that are anything BUT chicken breast + broccoli 

In my family for example, asian food is very important to us (I’m American but I grew up in Japan when I was very little.) Asian cuisine is my favorite and has always been a part of my identity. I love Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Taiwanese, (etc.) food. I’m trying to lose weight, but it’s so hard to stick to such basic recipes. I also love to cook and get bored very easily with food, so I like variety.  And I feel like it’s not easy to find multicultural, low-calorie specific dishes on YouTube or through fitness blogs. The most “ethnic” food that’s common is maybe Greek salad or poké. Also, maybe there are some great recipes out there that I have no idea are so nutritional, or can be low-calorie adaptable.

So, I was hoping to open up the discussion about diet/nutritional recipes from other countries and cultures! 😊

I’ll start! 
Earlier this week I made a light Sundubu jjigae. If you don’t know it, it’s a Korean spicy tofu stew. There are a few different versions, but it’s totally customizable to your preferences. The base is made with fish stock, soft tofu, and Korean chili flakes. From there, you can add or subtract whatever ingredients you want. The traditional broth is the most complex part, but you can even use chicken or vegetables stock, it’s totally up to you! It’s filling and pretty low calorie depending on what you add. The stew I made was :
- Fish/algae/bonito broth
- Spicy paste (chili flakes, minced garlic, minced ginger, teaspn of soy sauce, teaspn of sesame oil) 
- Green onion
- Cabbage (lots)
- Spinach (LOTS) 
- Soft tofu 

And that’s it! It’s delicious with seafood, kimchi, and if you want extra protein you can drop raw egg to make an egg-drop soup vibe 😊 there are so many recipes for this online if you need a more detailed list of ingredients

Looking forward to reading your suggestions later! ",nutrition,1547997767,not_suze,1,1,True,2019-01-20

Why do I get yeast infection symptoms from Kombucha?,"Why do I get yeast infection symptoms from Kombucha?

Hi everyone!

I was diagnosed with candida overgrowth and SIBO about 4 years ago and have been on a relatively lower carb diet since. One thing I noticed, though, is I tend to get yeast infection symptoms when I drink Kombucha (usually the GT brand). My vagina area will get itchy and have more discharge, sorry TMI. Why is this? I thought putting more good bacteria would reduce the candida. Plus after being on an anti candida diet for so long, you think my body would be able to handle it without this reaction (whether this is die off or maybe the sugar in the Kombucha is causing more candida to increase?).

Anyone experience the same? Any tips?

Baking sweet potatoes- temperature/timing to use to lower GI/conversion to sugar?,"As far as I'm aware, as I read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/8cux99/why_does_a_sweet_potato_taste_sweeter_when_you/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/8vy9p0/healthiest_way_to_eat_potatoes/) baking sweet potatoes as opposed to steaming/microwaving them turns some of the starch into sugar. So, one could peruse that steaming/microwaving would be healthier.

Unfortunately, doing so is just not convenient for me, as I have to make my food in large batches for preparation purposes/it saves time. So I was wondering, is there a way to BAKE sweet potatoes (meaning a certain temperature and time) that still keeps most of the starch?

Feel free to share...sorry if this isn't the best sub, but it kind of had to do with nutrition science I guess. Plus, I see a lot of people on here regard sweet potatoes as a superfood and eat it!

List of foods in the bible,"[https://www.thoughtco.com/foods-of-the-bible-700172](https://www.thoughtco.com/foods-of-the-bible-700172)

&amp;#x200B;

Foods are popular because they taste good, make someone who eats them feel good, and cure disease so presumably that list is nutritionally complete; that is those foods contain every single known essential, and non essential nutrient, including ones that have never been discovered, and those that will never be discovered. I'm eating ones from the fruits/nuts category as they seem the most appealing to me. If someone is sick look through the categories of foods (grains, animal foods, seeds, fruits etc), and decide which category seems appealing, then go, and buy a number of foods from that category, and eat them each day for a while, and see if they feel better. If no go, and buy more foods from the same category until hitting on the food that helps or just keep going through the whole list until hit on the right one. the animals foods include organs too like liver, which is super nutrient dense. Plant foods are high in mono saccharides aka the 8 essential sugars + 10 other known ones that have unknown metabolic function.

How does insulin resistance cause obesity?,"I've been studying insulin a lot as of late and its effects on the human body. One thing I keep hearing over and over is that insulin resistance will lead to obesity. Could someone please explain the exact mechanism on how this happens? As I understand it, when someone is diabetic, they are insulin resistant. So when they eat food, the glucose doesn't get properly cleared from the blood once insulin is released because their cells have become desensitized to it. So the glucose remains floating in the blood for extended periods of time. What happens to this glucose? Does it forever float in the blood? Does it get flushed out? If so, wouldn't this prevent someone from becoming obese?

""I  start this review with a disclaimer: I am a registered dietitian, the  ""nutritionist"" profession that Teicholz spends 336 pages discrediting,  berating, and I'd go so far as to say vilifying. It was a little hard  not to take it personally after the umpteenth snide comment dripping  with condescension.   


With that being said, Teicholz does not miss  the mark entirely, and there are many reasons to praise this book. The  research, though problematic at times (we'll get to that), is thorough,  and for a book that is literally comprised of 300+ pages of scientific  review, Teicholz does an impeccable job of keeping the reader focused  and engaged. She has made nutrition research accessible to the masses,  only getting bogged down in complicated (but necessary) physiological  and chemical processes a small handful of times.  


She's also not  wrong: Keys' research on saturated fats and heart disease WAS flawed;  low fat diets ARE absurd; trans fats, interesterified oils, and  vegetable oils ARE harmful; and sugar DOES need to be taken seriously as  a threat to human health.   


But I found myself, page after page,  becoming extremely frustrated by Teicholz' arguments. This book, though  lengthy, is an oversimplification of the issue at hand, and before you  pick up her book and your plate of bacon, you might want to consider  these points:  


(1) Teicholz does an excellent job of proving that a  low fat diet is misguided. She also does a good job of explaining why  many of the OILS in our diet are worse for our health than butter. But  these are not the fats I recommend to clients. What about avocados,  nuts, seeds, and whole olives? What about these foods, whole foods,  unprocessed foods -- and yes, vegetarian foods -- which naturally  contain UNsaturated fats (monounsaturated or omega-3 polyunsaturated,  mostly)? She never mentions those. THESE are the ones I encourage my  clients to eat. I agree that omega-6 rich vegetable oils are  inflammatory. I agree that deep frying in them is an issue (though I  would argue that deep fried ANYTHING should not be a staple in your  diet). I agree that butter is healthier than margarine. But she doesn't  prove that a moderate-high fat diet comprised mostly of saturated fats  is superior to a moderate-high fat diet comprised of whole food sources  of unsaturated fats (avocados, nuts, seeds, and whole olives). In fact,  she never even mentions them at all.  


(2) Teicholz mistakenly  conflates vegetarianism/veganism with low-fat, when in fact, when I plan  diet recommendations for my vegetarian and vegan clients, they wind up  being HIGHER in fat than many omnivorous diets. This is because to get  adequate protein on a vegetarian/vegan diet, you tend to rely on foods  that come packaged with fat: nuts, seeds, and cheese for vegetarians all  provide more fat than they do protein (cheese is usually pretty equally  distributed). Again, Teicholz never assesses a moderate-high fat  vegetarian or vegan diet, neither proving nor disproving its  comparability to her much-beloved high fat omnivorous diet.  


(3)  Just because the Inuits thrive on a diet almost exclusively comprised of  animal fats, or Pacific Islanders fare better with native coconut oil  (highly saturated) than Western vegetable oils or olive oil or  what-have-you, does not mean that everyone will. This is shaky  territory, but emerging research is leaning toward the concept of  genetics, epigenetics, and environment playing integral roles on how an  INDIVIDUAL human being uniquely digests, absorbs, and utilizes the  nutrients and food ingested. Case studies of traditional cultures can be  useful, but extrapolating sweeping generalizations from them and  applying them on a global scale is not only flawed, but downright  inappropriate.   


(4) This book does not distinguish between types  of carbohydrates. If you're going to devote an entire book, and a very  sizable one at that, to proving that a specific type of dietary fat is  healthful while other specific types of dietary fats are harmful, how  can you group ALL carbohydrates into one bucket of doom and disaster?  Are you really telling me that fruits and vegetables are wreaking as  much havoc on public health as refined sugar and white flour? Seriously?  I wouldn't recommend anyone take notes from The Banana Girl who claims  to live like a monkey and subsist almost exclusively on an absurd amount  of bananas every day, but you can't make the argument that the  landscape of dietary fats is riddled with nuances yet that of dietary  carbohydrates is not.   


(5) The saturated fats in bacon and  sausage may not be an issue, but saturated fats are not the only  component of processed meats. To assert that these highly processed  meats, full of preservatives, low grade meat, and additives are boons to  the health industry simply because they contain saturated fats is  ridiculous. Research is pretty clear on their ties to certain cancers,  and it's not the saturated fats that researchers worry about. It's the  other components that come bundled up with the saturated fat. So even if  you decide to go from low fat milk to whole or ditch margarine for  good, old-fashioned butter...maybe don't go hog-wild on the processed  meats just yet, ok? Please?  


And I would be remiss if I didn't  point out the hundreds of clients I have seen who at some point tried  Atkins, and it ""worked,"" until they couldn't do it anymore...because our  bodies are hard-wired to function on some amount of carbohydrates, and  feeling shaky, irritable, foggy, dizzy, and downright hangry all the  time led them to a carbohydrate binge. They lost weight...at first. And  then gained it all back and more. There are three macronutrients for a  reason. We're meant to eat all three. Maybe we'd fare better eating MORE  fat and LESS carbohydrates, but all-or-nothing on either end doesn't  work for the majority of people.  


There is no single problem with  the ""state of affairs"" today. Is low-fat part of it? Yes. Is high sugar  intake? Absolutely. But we have to think bigger than micro- and  macronutrients. We're disconnected from our food. We've outsourced  cooking from our own kitchens to restaurants and food manufacturing  factories. We aren't really even eating food anymore, half the time,  just somewhat edible food-like...stuff. Our palates have been distorted  by hyperpalatability. We view cooking and eating as inconveniences. We  mindlessly munch while constantly distracted by electronic screens.  We're not moving our bodies. We're not sleeping. We're over-committed  and stressed. The health of Western society cannot be cured by replacing  an apple or a tomato with a big steak and a side of sausage.  


Teicholz  delivers her message with incredible zeal, and it's easy to get swept  up in someone else's passion and persuasion. I get it; there were a  great many moments where I was right there with her. I'm happy to have  read the book and applaud her for taking a stab at such a scientific  behemoth, but please don't take her words as dogma. I worry that her  message will manifest itself in gross distrust of all health  professionals, especially nutritionists, and I've worked hard to give my  clients the most accurate recommendations possible. I've spent many  years in school and the ensuing years reading research and exposing  myself to a variety of viewpoints to try to parse out the truth from the  corruption and bias. There are some sheep in the dietitian world who  live and die by the sword of governmental dietary recommendations and  brainwashing by BigAg, but we aren't all like that, I promise.  


In  the end, make this one book you read out of many on the subject. Look  into the research she references. Expose yourself to opposing views.  Listen to your own body and how you feel when you eat various foods.  Nutrition is a relatively new science and there's a lot we don't know  because there's a lot we don't understand about the human body. Teicholz  MAY be 100% right. She MAY be completely off base.   


More than  likely, though, as with most things in life, the truth lies somewhere in  the uncomfortable, messy grey area between those two extremes.""

Hulled barley serving size = raw or cooked?,"Hi all, sorry for my first post maybe being a not-so-smart one, but recently I've been on a more fiber-controlled diet (mostly veggies and beans with about 6 oz. of lean protein), but for my grains I've recently been trying out some hulled barley, and every product I've looked at lists a serving as about a quarter cup or somewhere whereabouts.  I'm assuming that this means raw, since the expansion of the barley - I know hulled expands a lot more than pearled - is going to be pretty much water retention, at least I assume.  But I was wondering if anyone who has ever cooked with hulled barley before has had any experience in the area and might have a better idea of whether the following sounds like it might be closer to a quarter cup of raw or cooked barley:

- 170 cal.
- 37g carbohydrates
- 5g fat

How do I know my true macros?,"Let me start by saying, what I’m doing now is clearly working but i want to make sure I’m not hurting myself in the long run and not realizing it. 
I’ve been on track for 2 and a half weeks now, minus a bit of cheating one day over the last weekend (so hard to resist ice cream). Im working out 3-4x a week at Orange Theory and I’m seeing physical changes like less bloating, my arms look less flabby and feel stronger, I feel good (except still not feeling a big increase in energy), my skin looks healthier, etc. of course I’m thrilled to see so many NSVs in such a short amount of time. My question is, how do I know my actual macros? MFP says I should have roughly 1530 cal. Per day. I looked up on the IIFYM site and it says over 2000 calories. I’ve been doing what MFP says but I want to make sure I’m being healthy and not depriving myself of essential nutrients and all that. Im also signed up for the 8 week transformation challenge at OT and I want to make sure I’m eating right to lose weight for that as well. I guess feeling good is a great start! But if I go over what MFP says i should eat, i want to know if I’m really hurting my weight loss/body or not.

"Thoughts on Daily Harvest, Splendid Spoon, etc.? I have zero time and can't drive to a grocery store.","I usually meal prep well in advance but lately I have had to juggle a 50 hour work week, 10 credits of law school (15+ hrs weekend hw), settling an estate, court-ordered therapy, and a restricted license to boot where I'm not allowed to drive to the grocery store (or to my mom's estate an hour away!). Taking the bus or train to the grocery store becomes a 3 hour affair, which I just do not have time for. Luckily this is not my life forever, but I realized today that I haven't had an actual meal since Monday's holiday (although I have had a couple of cliff bars and smoothies since then) and I won't have a chance to cook until 9 pm tonight - I can't really afford to eat out everyday at the upscale restaurants near my office, which are a 15 minute walk away anyway.

Anyway, I'm strongly considering a meal delivery service (since I can't drive) from Daily Harvest or Splendid Spoon. I tried ordering groceries a few weekends ago from Prime but I haven't managed to prep as much as I wanted, and my cilantro is already going bad :/ I have NOT tried ordering frozen meals from Prime - I see this brand Amy everywhere - it doesn't look too bad, any experiences? Ideally I'd order frozen meals from trader joes, but I don't think they deliver.  There is also a Subway a few blocks from my school, so that may be viable if I manage to get to campus early.

I was wondering if anyone has tried one of those frozen meal delivery services as a **complete meal replacement?**  Do you have to be home when they deliver?  I'm scared they will deliver during the day and I won't be able to put them in my freezer until like 9 (or 11 some nights) pm.  Can you specifically arrange a delivery time over the weekend?  Also, if anyone has any other ideas, I'm pretty desperate.  I'd like to avoid fast food/take out as much as humanly possible.  I don't really care about calories, but I do care about avoiding excess sugar, sodium, and getting an appropriate amount of vitamins and micronutrients.

&amp;#x200B;

Could having low vitamin C cause low iron absorption in the body?," 

Female, 22 years old, 5""5', 165 lbs.

Hello! I was wondering if anyone had experience with low iron saturation but normal iron stores?

I tested low for iron saturation twice, which my GP said was no problem but the rheumatologist said it was a type of iron deficiency and that I could choose to get a colonoscopy done if I wanted to based on a positive blood-stool test. The thing is it costs $500 and I'm a college student but I'll get it done if I must and save up. These are the results from yesterday-

IRON, SERUM: 50 range- 37-145 UG/DL

UNSATURATED IBC: 311 range- 112-347 UG/DL

CALC TOTAL IBC: 361 range- 250-450

**UG/DLCALC % IRON SAT: 14\*L range- 20-50 %**

This past weekend I also received my test results for a hair mineral analysis, which said my Iron, Vitamin C and Silica are deficient. Which makes sense, I am fatigued once a day, hair loss for past 5 months, brittle nails, etc. My diet doesn't include many carbs fortified with Vit C and I don't eat a lot of fruits (low carb.) So I'm wondering if I eat something like Guava high in Vit C everyday and take a good Vitamin C supplement would that help my body absorb the iron it has stored? I don't want to overdo iron supplementation since it looks like I'm storing it just not using it. I know this could be a shot in the dark, but I wanted to know if Vitamin C could be a factor into the weird iron issue!

A question about B12 and it's interactions. (Long post sorry),"So I'm not sure if this is the right place to be asking this but we'll see. I've always been interested in b12 shots and supplements due to low energy and stuff I drank with b12 in it making me feel good, but I've never actually tried it. 

I like to know about interactions and all that stuff before I start taking anything, but I can't find any information on what I'm about to ask about. 

I recently have started talking suboxone and quit doing any other drugs. I read b12 is particularly useful for people who did drugs because drugs mess up your ability to absorb/convert/whatever your b12 intake. 

Normally since b12 you can buy it at the store I'd have no second thought about taking it with my suboxone but there's a couple hiccups. I took some allergy medicine on it once and it made me incredibly sick so I'm already wary of it. My biggest/least rationale concern is this though. My mom recently had to be treated for an AFIB (problem with her heart) and my general anxiety has manifested itself about into panic attacks caused by me thinking my heart is being too fast or in an irregular way. 

So now because of that and the fact that b12 increases your energy levels I'm all paranoid that if I take it my heart will end up beating really fast and give me a  super big panic attack. 

Does anyone here have experience with taking b12 even just by itself? Did it effect your anxiety at all? Does anyone know if suboxone and b12 doesn't mix for some reason? Any thoughts or comments will be appreciated.

Conversely, I was reading something else that said more sodium = more water retention, period.

So which is it? Do any of you guys eat high sodium and not have water retention issues?

Is my calorie count and macros good for weight loss?,"Hi! I've started to change my nutrition one month ago and I've lost 1lb of weight so far, which seems like not so much so I want to ask for the opinion of people who are experienced, if what I'm doing is the right way(I'm thinking it could be due to muscle gain?) It would help me out a lot! 

My calorie goal is 1470 when I don't exercise. 
Im 5""2' and weigh 156 lbs. 
I have 2h ice hockey practices 2-3 times per week and do weight exercises once per week. On those days I eat 200-300 cals more. Apart from that, I am a student and sit a lot during the day. 

My macros are 45% carbs, 30% protein, 25% fat.
I find it really hard though to get enough protein and not too much fat. I eat meat but not very much since its expensive and I don't want to eat that much cause of the animals and stuff.

For example yesterday (this is a day of no sports, only 3000 steps counted)
Breakfast: 1oz Oats, Nuts and dried Fruits, skimmed milk, a small apple, 2 medium eggs
Lunch: chickpea-coconut milk-curry with rice
Snack: one mandarine and one kiwi
Dinner: Activia natural yogurt with honey, one slice proteinbread with 3 oz sliced turkey
Carbs: 161g of 161g
Protein: 80g of 108g
Fat: 42g of 40g
So I had too much fat and not enough protein. 

Do you have any tips on how to get more protein?

What would be the maximum about of omega 6 per day to consume through nuts?,"Hello! I've been keto for 9 months and I'm thinking on trying vegan keto.

However - I don't want to get too many omega 6 from hempseeds. Right now, I'm factoring in 2 tbsp which has 5.5 grams of omega 6. On top of 2 tbsps of olive oil and other foods in the day, I think I'll be at about 8.7-9.5 grams of omega 6 in total per day.

Dr. Gundry is selling people a bill of fake goods,"After scouring through Dr. Gundry's claims, not only are they lacking in scientific evidence, but he distorts information from a handful of studies towards his own bias, which in my view, is to make money off of unsuspecting people. He appeals to 'authority'  because he is an M.D. An appeal to authority is a common type of fallacy, or an argument based on unsound logic. He is claiming what he says is true, because he is an ""authority"" on the subject, therefore he does not need to follow the rules of sound science as established by credible research institutions. (There are plenty of fake or suspect ones, along with weak academic journals that publish rubbish. Know your sources!)  Additionally, an M.D. degree is not a terminal degree. To become a medical doctor you do not have write a dissertation, defend you sources, or learn to research, as is required in sound academia. Neither do you have to discuss views opposing your own, or create logical reasoning, backed by research, as to why you oppose them. In my view, he does not follows the gold standard for experiments using randomized and controlled designs.

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) issues,"Friendly greetings,


I've been tracking my macros, vitamins and minerals via cronometer daily and have noticed that I only ever reach a maximum of 50% of the recommended intake of B1, and if I don't include liver and eggs it's usually a fair bit less. 

I'm on a ketogenic diet as it seems to be one of the only things improving my depression, so I can't really eat many of the foods high in thiamine, and the keto friendly solutions are quite expensive for me (salmon etc). This sucks a bit because I love my carbs and metabolise them very well, so it's strange that limiting them seems to be helping. Placebo or not, I'm unsure.

I see that lean pork is an option, but I was wondering if anyone could recommend other ways of reaching the RDA. Supplementation? 

B1 seems to be quite important from what I understand in psychiatric disorders, so I'd like to try upping my dose naturally to see if I can notice any difference.

Many thanks in advance!

Both years I've also had to explain to my doctor why my blood sugar reads so low and my ketones high  and the diet itself so I doubt he would know if it was having an effect.

Food as catalyst for nervous system states?,"I heard a theoretical diet plan laid out on a podcast (Strongfit) that interested me and wanted some thoughts on some of the claims (they are quick to mention they dont have studies for this diet, it just works for them). Its essentially a targeted ketogenic diet with fats in morning, for lunch veggies and if a workout day just enough lunch carbs and sugar needed to maintain and be burned off for an intense workout (honey, oats, even minimal whiskey as it triggers a sympathetic nervous system response for weight training. If cardio then minimal carbs/clean sugar source).  

For dinner just protein and veggies. The philosophy behind the diet is that fats help with mental focus, carbs get you through workouts, and protein at night helps you wind down and get into a parasympathetic state. They separate these macros in 90/10 divisions to try and elicit a desired nervous system state. They theorize since we can only fluctuate between fight or flight and rest and digest in the autonomic nervous system, our diets should look to enhance what we need. since modern society is so cushy to our nervous system  (not talking about mental problems like anxiety, depression etc) then we crave the fight or flight rush we get from excess carbs, booze, intense exercise.

Question about RDI of nutrients,"Hello, I have recently become interested in eating well and I have changed my diet to try and eat a more varied in nutritious diet while avoiding supplements.

&amp;nbsp;

Doing this I have noticed that it is ingredibly hard to reach RDIs for many nutrients, even cutting out carbs like pasta and rice and eating only greens, beans, nuts and meat. Of course I don't expect to eat 100% RDI of ecvery nutrient every day, and I'm still alive and feeling good so I must be getting what I need through my food. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that got me thinking. Before I changed my diet I was eating pretty unhealthily. Seeing as I'm just barely even reaching RDI of a lot of nutrients with my new diet, how come I didn't get sick before? A standard day for me two years ago would have been something like this: coffee for breakfast, some rice or spaghetti and about 150 g of meat with a (usually) cream based sauce for lunch, and something similar to what I had for lunch as dinner. I ate very little vegetables, basically no beans/lentils, and very seldom did I eat any fish.

&amp;nbsp;

Doing some basic calculations of my nutrient intake back then had me not even coming close to getting enough of most vitamins. How come I could live that way for several years and still feel fine for the most part?

Nutrition Expert Interested in Helping Create Diet Tool?,"Hi all,

I've been gaining an increased interest in personal nutrition as it seems like something so easy but is actually quite complicated if one really wants to optimize their nutrition and metabolism. I've used MyFitnessPal in the past and found it helpful in tracking macronutrients, but when it came to satisfying the RDA of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and exploring things such as flavonoids or omega-3s, I found that it was fairly lacking.

I've been writing some code to collect and analyze highly detailed nutritional information from the USDA Food Composition Databases. This data includes various forms of the same vitamins, ten different minerals, specific flavonoids, and even things like caffeine and theobromine content of standard foods.

I'd like to create a tool to recommend whole foods that can help balance out a person's daily diet in terms of all of these factors but I have quite a few questions and was hoping there would be a nutrition expert interested in sharing some information and opinions. I plan to offer the tool for free in the form of a website or web app.

Wife not eating,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this subreddit but I'm in desperate need of a desperate solution.

My wife is not eating...at all.  She used to be a little overweight 2 years ago but her entire family drilled it into her head that she needs to lose weight.  Constantly day and night they would pester her about it.  Unfortunately she made up her mind actually did start to lose weight.  From trying out disgusting Chinese weight loss teas (unproven of course) to outright starving herself, she eventually dropped down all the way to her current weight of \~120 pounds.

&amp;#x200B;

She started running into health issues 5 months ago.  Fainting, constant low blood pressure and insanely small appetite are only some of the symptoms.  They are getting worse and worse with increasing frequency.  Her stomach has shrunk so much that eating anything besides the 2 slices of bread and 1 egg in the morning will cause her to puke.

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention that I'm currently in Canada while my wife is way out in the Southeast Asia living with her family.  I'm only here for work reasons but now plan to go back since it's obvious that her own family either don't give two shits or know how to do anything properly.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some quick methods, solutions, meal plans, diet tips/tricks, whatever you have.  Sort of like a metaphorical ""adrenaline shot"" to at least make her stable enough for a long term solution.  Please and thank you so much in advance for all your help.  You guys have no incentive to help me but you still will and I cannot put into words how much I appreciate that!",nutrition,1544855608,scourgereaver,18,1,True,2018-12-15

"I’m having intense sugar withdrawals, has anyone else experienced this?","Hey guys! For context (don’t know if this matters) I’m 5’10, and East African.

If I go a day without having sugar I find myself having intense headaches &amp; hunger. Sometimes I can’t even concentrate. I’m not really a savoury person by any means, I just really really really have a sugar addiction. My body/mind almost feels “calm” after I have a sugary drink or a sweet.

I have tried to curb this by only eating fruit or fruit smoothies, but it doesn’t hit the spot at all. I feel annoyed and agitated. Is there any way to fix this or do I just have to ride the withdrawal wave until it goes away? Thanks in advance everyone xx

I haven't worked out in quite some time, and I'm still trying to get used to consuming enough calories. At the moment, I think I'm under consuming a bit. 

I was trying to come up with ways to get easy calories, without having another meal because I've been too full to eat more meals. 

I had a thought of making some shakes. My goal would be two of them per day. One in the morning, and one sometime in the evening after working out. I'm a peanut butter-aholic, and milk lover. So I decided to try mixing 8 oz of milk, and I measured out 3 tbsp (level scoops) of peanut butter. I only did this precise measurement because normally I take large scoops. I had no idea what 3 tbsp actually looked like. I decided to add a scoop of whey protein powder too, for an extra 120 calories. 

I already drink 8 ounces of milk, and 1 scoop of powder once I get back from the gym in the evening. Having two of the shakes listed above, would increase that to 3 scoops of whey powder consumed per day. I wasn't sure if this was a bad thing?

Would it be more wise to substitute the scoop of whey powder with 1/2 cup of granola, or another plop of peanut butter? ",nutrition,1545017117,DrZoo4040,1,1,True,2018-12-16

Vegetable diets,"Hello all. 

I follow this sub and some others pretty close, and I have noticed an odd trend. 

When people ask for general advice pertaining to enhancing their diet, such as “what should everyone add to their diet?”, or “what are the best foods to help with weight loss/ depression/ energy etc.” everyone seems to have obscure answers. We promote things like tea, beans, fish, and nuts. Now these are all things that can be healthy, but my understanding of nutrition has always been more simplistic than that. 

If you are going to change one thing in your diet or are looking for the “magic bullet” of nutrition. EAT MORE VEGETABLES. Obviously some are better than others. And some people are looking for a deeper answer than that. But the reality is 90% of people would be in better health if they added 1 extra serving of vegetables daily. 

I have no studies to support my opinion. So I am interested to hear thoughts from all of you well informed people. Is my understanding of vegetables being the holy grail somehow misinformed?",nutrition,1545053213,Sinsyxx,79,1,True,2018-12-17

Im  not a big fan of non stick cookware.   I like cast iron and stainless  steel.  But with these I need something so my scrambled eggs dont stick.   I dont use much.   Just a quick spray then evenly spread it with a  paper towel.

How long does it take for bodily stores of Omega-3 to deplete after stopping supplementation?,"For the purpose of the post, let's also assume a diet very low in Omega-3. I'm asking because there does seem to be evidence that Omega-3's immunosuppressive qualities could reduce the body's positive responses to illness. However, I can't figure out if stopping taking fish oil at onset of an illness would meaningfully lower bodily stores of Omega-3 in a helpful amount of time. For reference, reaching a maximum bodily load takes \~3 weeks whereas I'm usually only sick for 3-5 days.

Eating Aloe Vera,"Wow.  Not sure where to go with this, but I’m just gonna start typing and hope it goes somewhere.  So little known fact, Aloe Vera is super healthy to eat!  In Japan people eat it in yogurt and beverages.  

So I tried Aloe a couple times this week, with lime juices.  Fortunately, I didn’t puke or anything.  The texture is something to get used to.  You can cook or eat it raw, but even when cooked it will still be slimy, just considerably less slimy.  Keep this in mind if you are very “texture sensitive” to foods.

I actually like eating the skin, it is bitter but I really enjoyed it! However the meat of the aloe... very strange.  I will continue to eat it!  It kinda tastes very slightly bitter but is almost flavorless, then you get a sweet kick at the end.  But biting into it is like biting a gel gusher!!!!  

Benefit-wise, I’m pretty sure you can live without it, worth trying, but I found that it makes me feel physically well afterwards.  Almost refreshed! 

I’ve only tried one species of 400, and I’m not sure what the name of that species is, so I apologize for not being able to give info on that, but I suggest trying different types if the first time you hate it! Give it a try!

would the only difference between having casein and not having it be the time between getting prostate cancer and the time when it's large enough to be detected?  am i missing something?

Is 100 g of protein daily too much for a man (like me)?,"Hello

Is taking 100 g of protein daily too much for a man 30 year old man? Who is:

\- 175 cm height

\- 88 kg weight (im not fat)

\-Sedentary life style (i work with PC and am majority of time sitting in front of a pc), BUT

\-I also sport 4 times per week =

\-2 times per week i run (not fast, something between jogging and running) 10 km (a bit over) 

\- and 2 times per week i workout with dumbbell (around 12,5 kg (?) )  12\*6times (in each hand) and then i go like 45\*3 pushups and i do some abdomen (belly) workouts - 40\*3.

&amp;#x200B;

I take around 100 g of protein daily (i would like to build some muscle).

1 main meal per day + 2x protein shake (daily (isnt that too much protein shakes daily?)), and 2x some other protein sources - mainly from milk (i dont eat much meat for whatever reason).

In total  around 100 g of protein daily for the last like 3-4 months(?). Before that i had only like 30 f of protei ndaily (too litle i know, i get into nutrition only around 4 months ago).

So is 100 g for a man like me too much? I read somewhere that the more protein you take, the more you can age and that taking too much protein makes you age quicker (in general)- i think it was from Dr. Valter Longo.

So yeah... is 100 g of protein too much (only around 10-15g of that protein is from meat) and could it ""hurt me""? (mainly in the aging issue)?

I am trying to eat a longevity based diet, incorporating my knowledge of nutritional studies, Blue Zone diets, methionine restriction, etc.

So my general principles are:

1.) Getting my protein mostly from plant sources (primarily legumes and nuts).

2.) Not eating too much sugar, therefore not too much fruit (I only eat 1.5 cups of blueberries).

3.) Eating ""the rainbow"", as many different colors as possible (blue:blueberries, orange:carrots, red:bell-pepper, green:broccoli/leaves, purple:beet).

4.) Eat a limited amount of animal products, namely fish, and not just skeletal muscle tissue. I eat one can of sardines per day (entire animal, source of omega-3).

5.) High glycine to methionine ratio. I supplement with bone broth every day.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I get about 780 calories from carbs, 930 from fats, and 420 from protein. 2:2:1 essentially.

I am eating 2 cups of beans per day, and 1.25 cups of seeds/nuts per day. I rotate them to some extent.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is primarily related to my high fat content. I eat an entire large avocado every day, a cup of olives every day, as well as a high amount of nuts. I know that avocados are supposed to be healthy, but that is usually told to people that are switching hamburgers for avocados. But if you are focused on maximizing health, would I be better off dropping the avocados and replacing with a different fat source? I'm eating 370 calories a day just from avocado.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other parting thoughts from you experts?",nutrition,1545249426,smattiso,3,1,True,2018-12-19

"is there any point you get to where a ""cheat"" meal is adverse for you","so this question is kinda derived from my understanding that if you're doing keto you get to a point where you're in ketosis and eating something can put you out of it? apologies if i have that wrong i don't personally follow keto. 

but along those same lines i was wondering is there a threshold you get to where if you have a deviation then you get thrown out of whatever. like if you go meat free or vegan or dairy free or gluten free or sugar free etc and you decide to break from that diet for one time does anything happen.

like if i'm gluten free just for personal reasons not coeliacs and follow it for a year or so and decide to cheat with bread one day, and then go back to gluten free the next. does it mean anything besides knowing i broke my personal rule. did i get to any point where being GF was doing something to my body where breaking away from it threw me off balance?

Confused on how to proceed with calorie intake.,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this short and to the point

* 28 yo male, 6' 1"" , 175 lbs.
* Recent years I've become more sedentary, got some belly fat
* Back in the gym now, drinking water and making smart choices with food
* I want to put on 5-10 lbs of muscle AND
* I want to lose belly fat as well

What I'm not sure of is how I'm supposed to regulate calorie intake.

1. Reduce calorie intake/increase protein to burn off extra fat and build muscle
2. Increase calorie intake/increase protein to aid with muscle growth, but will I burn enough to lose fat?
3. Maintain calorie intake/increase protein to burn off extra fat and turn it to muscle.

I apologize if this is stupid or if I didn't do enough research, but any advice is appreciated.

Say you need 2000 calories a day to maintain but you instead consume 0 calories Monday, 2000 Tuesday however Wednesday you hit 4000 calories then go back to 2000 for the rest of the Week. Does your body remember that you consumed 0 calories 2 days ago so it evens out the 4000 calorie day?

I've seen a lot of people say weekly calories should be what you count but I'm confused as to how your body would remember the calories you consumed 2 days ago to mean you wouldn't gain from the 4000 calorie day.

How wood you rank the berries?,"Given a choice of cranberries, barberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries, and grapes, how would you rank them? This does not include pesticides by the way, and no fruits like kiwis or bananas despite being berries.

Mine would go like this: (I’m not informed enough on cranberries or barberries so I didn’t include them in mine)

1. Blackberries - Little sugar, more fiber, the most zinc, lots of vitamin C and K, and more antioxidants than most.
2. Blueberries - Too much sugar, but balances it out with vitamin C and K, only slightly less antioxidants than blackberries, blood glucose stabilizing, and memory loss preventing. Little low on minerals.
3. Raspberries - The most fiber, the least sugar tied with strawberries, and more antioxidants than strawberries. More ellagic acid too.
4. Strawberries - Feel like a nerfed version of raspberries but with more vitamin C. 
5. Grapes - Too much sugar, not enough benefits. Only worth it for the resveratrol, but all these berries have it anyways.

I just want to say that for doing nothing but cycling, my whole body is pretty ripped. I've been eating more to try to get stronger to prep my body for weight lifting in the new year. 

But fuck me, unless I'm cycling (and unfortunately smoking weed) I can not eat. 

Yesterday and Wednesday I took off. I ate three meals Wednesday, barely two yesterday and even though I worked today I could barley stomach 1 &amp; 1/2. 

Part of it could be holiday stress? But I thought I was plateauing and I added more food. But now I can't seem to want to eat?

I want to blame the smoking, but it genuinely feels like there's so much stuff in my intestines that my body can't handle more food.

Is Numbeo's Recommended Minimum Money for Food inaccurate or is nearly everyone including the upper class in my country all suffering from malnutrition?,"Hi there, 

I live in Bangladesh. On Numbeo, it says that for an individual the Recommended Minimum Amount of Money for food (2400 calories, Asian food types) is [BDT 8054/=](https://www.numbeo.com/food-prices/in/Dhaka) in Dhaka, the capital. 

Now the thing is, I have not seen even the richest Bangladeshis to spend anywhere that amount of money on food per person. Even those earning BDT 80,000 to BDT 150,000 per month don't spend more than BDT 4000 on food per month per person. This excludes eating out and assumes they eat at home everyday.  

That goes for the upper class people and I have some idea of the lifestyle given I deal with finances. And that leaves the middle class, those earning BDT 15,000 to BDT 25,000 per month in household income. Which usually means a father earning that much and supporting a wife and 2 to 3 kids. 

Then there are those that earn below BDT 15,000 in household income [husband, wife and 4 or more kids!] comprising most Bangladeshis. 

The upper and middle classes don't look like they are suffering from malnutrition. Nor do they believe they are doing so. For the lower class I am not sure if its only the malnutrition or the hard labor but there is definitely physical signs of weariness among older people. 

My question is: Is the Recommended Minimum Amount of Money for Food at Numbeo correct or is nearly every upper and middle class Bangladeshis struggling with malnutrition?",nutrition,1545489353,Experimentalphone,7,1,True,2018-12-22

"""Clean Bulking"" : How much dietary fat?","So I know that dietary fat doesn't make you fat. It's essential to hormones, and in turn muscle building /fat loss.

&amp;#x200B;

However, in the bodybuilding world, nutrition is super important; especially balance of macros, when building a good physique. So my question is, how much fat should I be eating, when my goal is to gain muscle without gaining body fat?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know I stated that fat doesn't make you fat, HOWEVER, studies \*have allegedly\* shown \[that carbs are LESS LIKELY to be stored as body fat\] ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877815000599](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877815000599)) in a period of caloric excess, which is basically ""bulking"". \[Here's Dr. Mike Isratel\]([https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/](https://renaissanceperiodization.com/case-high-carb-massing/)) talking about it. Basically stated that high carb, low fat massing is best for limiting fat gain while gaining muscle. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, you have well respected coaches like Charles Poloquin that state carbs aren't essential to building muscle. So these guys are advocating for a high fat, low carb diet (with carbs coming directly after exercise for glycogen replenishment).

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a healthy breakfast?,"Hello,

I've been learning quite a lot about nutrition in the last few months, however, when it comes to breakfast, I am at a loss. I am just not sure if it's healthy. What do you say?

So what do you think about a breakfast that basically consists of fruits, soy milk chia pudding, a selection of nuts and seeds (almonds, cashews, walnuts, flax seeds) and homemade granola (no sugar added except for honey, apart from that coconut oil). As for the fruits, there is half a banana, a quarter of a dragonfruit, a quarter of a mango and 1/8 papaya in it.

My thinking is that there is a good amount of protein from the soy milk chia pudding, healthy fats from the nuts, some carbs from the granola (around four teaspoons) and vitamins from the fruits. I am aware that it's quite a lot of fruits thus fructose, however, they contain a lot of water and of course fibre and in combination with the rest I am thinking it's ok.

What is your opinion on this breakfast? Really curious :)

Reverse diseases of the civilization eating the right food,"Hello guys,

My friend and I have been working on a mobile app project to help people reverse what we know as disease of the civilization:

- obesity
- diabetes
- high blood sugar
- high triglyceride 
- high fasting insulin 

And overall poor metabolic health marker. Current lifestyle doesn’t respect our primal biology like:

Being sitting in an office for 8h
Under artificial light
Eating high sugar high carb diet
Having low intensity exercises
Being in fight or flight mode for years because of money

So we decided to help people to find back better habits by eating the right food depending their goals. 

We provide insulin index of foods and a nutrient density score that help them to understand is that food is providing the right nutrient profile and doesn’t spike their insulin so much.

If you would like to have a look at our app and the content we share around you can have a look here https://nutrita.app

"I've been doing some research on fatty acids, and I need some help.","I've been reading a lot of diets and nutrition lately, and I've come across a lot of different claims about why people need to eat fat/avoid fat and what kind of fats to consume. Here is what I've learned so far:

First of all, too much and too little of anything is bad for you. Fats are good for you and we need them in our body to carry out different functions like hormone regulations and nutrient transport. 

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) found in vegetables, nuts, and fish are better for your body than saturated fatty acids found in animals products and coconuts are for your body. However, the way PUFA and MUFA are commonly produced oxidizes the oil, which is horrible for your body. Also, exposure to heat oxidizes PUFA and MUFA (PUFA more easily), so cooking with these oils should be avoided. 

The direct correlation between saturated fats and heart diseases are being disputed right now, but it seems like consumption of saturated fats do have a directly link between high levels of LDL, which is an inflammatory agent. 

So, cook with saturated fat, but avoid it as much as you can, and try to eat healthier oils like PUFA and MUFA in their natural form and don't cook with them. 

Do these statements have any truth to them? I know I'm only scratching the surface and the actual chemical mechanisms are way too complex for anyone without a PhD to fully comprehend. I know that I'm also ignoring the effects of sugar, protein and other micro-nutrients and how these interact with fats in the body. But, I'm trying to simplify it as much as I can so I can apply to my daily life. Any clarifications or any scientific evidence that refutes anything I said would help a lot.

Dairy
Wheat
Oats
Rye

Are we overcomplicating nutrition and are there any blanket nutritional statements that can be made about what is good or not?,"So I was watching a guy on YouTube called gojiman. He's a a vegan nutritionist and a well educated guy but holy hell did this guy overcomplicate things and I guess this is pretty indicative of what's going on in nutrition today. He quite often goes into detail about various gut diseases like sibo, candida, leaky gut etc. He then has 6 different tests he sells for them. He tells what to eat and what not in the presence of x but not y. Certain foods you'd think would be healthy like cabbage are now bad if you have y and z but not x and y and ok if you have x and z combined with some supplement.

This isn't a personal attack on him but I see it as pretty indicative of modern day nutrition and overcomplicating it for the average guy.
Maybe I'm just an uneducated moron but man I just don't think our bodies are that sensitive. Nobody had knowledge or the resources ever in human history to go into such minute details and I personally think the human body is highly adaptable. It's only a recent phenomena to get this invested into nutrition and even then no one can stick to it 100%. Furthermore it seems like a huge money and time sink for the average asymptomatic person with no discernible issues, to go down this nutritional rabbit hole about what's good or not because given all the minutiae it's impossible to be 100% optimal. You just don't have the mental capacity, time, discipline or money to ever possibly get it all right imo. What do you guys think? Is it really that important to go into such detail and are our bodies really that adaptable or is there an ideal diet out there?





Secondly, are there ANY blanket statements about nutrition that can be made about what's good or bad? I guess avoiding sugar and exercising is all I can think off cause again there's so much conflicting science on whats good or bad. Some say meat is good others say it isn't. Same with startch, butter and pretty much anything that isn't green. So yeah what are some general blanket rules for a healthy diet that anyone can implement and should always consider?



TL:DR= 
Way too much information and diets out there. Is it really nessacary to go through it all and are our bodies adaptable enough for the most part?

"Is the oxalate content of TVP/soy protein isolate worth worrying about?

Okinawan vs NutritionFacts diet,"Hi,

I am of Chinese descent and am trying to follow the Okinawan diet (image link below) because it is closest to my ancestry and is famous for promoting longevity. I follow it very closely, eating 70% Okinawan sweet potatoes daily as they do, and only soy for my legumes.

Michael Greger recommends a Daily Dozen diet which is very different from the Okinawan diet, advocating more fruits, grains, and beans than the Okinawans consumed. I’m struggling to figure out which diet is healthier for me to follow. Would I potentially live longer and healthier following Greger’s Daily Dozen than the Okinawan diet? It is more varied than the Okinawan diet, but the Okinawan diet is proven to work since so many of them live to be 100+.

Thank you!

"Potential ""Downside"" or Dangers of Canned Chicken Breast (vs. Canned Tuna)","I recently discovered canned chicken breast from Kirkland Signature/Costco, seen here:
https://www.amazon.com/12-5oz-Premium-Chicken-Breast-Kirkland/dp/B00N6XOONC.

I bought some cans and I thought that for the price of each can and the ratio of protein to calories you get, these are good sources of cheap protein. 

These cans of chicken also have the upside over canned chunk light tuna fish or not having mercury, so there is no need to worry about getting too much mercury into my body via these cans. That got me thinking, before I start adding in these cans of chicken breast into my diet (let say between 1 - 3 a week), are there any other risks or dangers I should be aware of with canned chicken?

"Is eating ""junk food"" bad for your health if you consistently workout and get your other key macros/micros?","Been wondering this. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you consistently workout to the point where your weight stays the same and you are a low bodyfat, and get your micronutrients and macros (through veggies/fruits/fiber/etc), will one still be affected by the affects of junk food?

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I ask is that workout probably 3-5 times a week, around an hour each time, and maintain my same weight at the same bodyfat (\~12%). I also get my fiber (sweet potatoes!), and micronutrients each day (make a veggie/fruit smoothie everyday), and be sure to eat high omega meals in general, plus vitamen supplementation. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, I eat  junk food probably at least once every two days. why? Im busy as fuck and I just don't have time to eat a healthy meal all the time. and yes, it tastes good!  I also eat alot of meat (Steak/etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got done from my 1.5 hour workout, and I have to meet someone in 30 minutes and I have nothing healthy to eat, and im STARVING, so I picked up a double quarter pounder meal with large fries (skipping the soda).  this is after I slammed my veggies/fruit smoothie and took vitamen D/omega 3/etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

so my question is, I do this probably once every 2 days (for one meal). how bad is it?  is it something I need to really worry about if I workout a lot, get my other macros/micros and my blood tests show up fine (and they are).

I've accidently made myself lactose intolerant,"I stopped eating added sugar and processed food for a year and decided i tried to cut off all dairy amd cococa in order to clear my skin that sometimes gets bad ( nothing extreme acne wise but im a perfectionist and wanted perfect skin).

Decides to confirm hypothesis cause i could finnaly eat ice cream for the sake of science. And yeah im basicly lactose intolerant. 
I read something about the production of a vitamin that we produce when young to digest our moms milk but that we slowly stop making over the years (im 19 btw).

Taking Beta Alanine as an OCD / Depression sufferer?," 

Hey guys,

I just want to ask if there would be any concern taking Beta Alanine. I take 250 mg Luvox for OCD / Depression.

Which got me concerned was this excerpt on [examine.com](https://examine.com/)

Beta-alanine, when fed to mice over a month, did not appear to significantly influence serotonin or adrenaline levels in the cortex or the hypothalamus. However, it reduced levels of serotonin’s main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in the hypothalamus.[**\[82\]**](https://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/#ref82) A significant increase in brain carnosine and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels were also noted.[**\[82\]**](https://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/#ref82)

In the nucleus accumbens, dopamine levels appear to increase as beta-alanine concentrations increase from 0.1 to 10 mM. Beta-alanine would exert this effect through the glycine receptor, not unlike taurine, [**alcohol**](https://examine.com/supplements/alcohol/), or glycine itself.[**\[95\]**](https://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/#ref95)

So in conclusion: Would the Beta alanine lower serotonin in the hypothalamus which would be bad for depression? (Excuse my english, it isn't my first language) - I also read somewhere that users report depression as a side effects past the 8 weeks-mark, which could be also caused by taurine depletion?

If the Beta Alanine increased dopamine concentration in the Nucleus Accumbens, which is overactive in OCD, could that potentially worsen the OCD?

Thanks in regard,

Spinach vs. Broccoli Sprouts?,"I was hoping for some assistance. I'm trying to compare the vitamin, mineral, and antioxidant content of broccoli  (and other) microgreens with spinach. Microgreens, specifically broccoli sprouts and broccoli microgreens have been showing a lot of promise as a superfood.

I've been able to find the mineral content for broccoli microgreens, but am having trouble finding the vitamin content.

So far, from what I can see, the mineral content in regular spinach on par and higher than broccoli microgreens. That said, maybe the vitamin content is higher?

And, the concentration and variety of Polyphenols in broccoli sprouts might be much higher than Spinach / adult broccoli... but I'm not sure how to compare that since I don't understand enough about Polyphenols.

Here's the mineral breakdown of broccoli microgreens and spinach:

&amp;#x200B;

Broccoli microgreens:

**Per 100g (3.53 oz)**

**Calcium: 88mg**

**Magnesium: 51mg**

**Phosphorus: 69mg**

**Potassium: 326mg**

**Sodium: 52mg**

**Iron: 0.67mg**

**Zinc: 0.37mg**

**Copper: 0.09mg**

**Manganese: 0.37mg**

&amp;#x200B;

Spinach:

**Per 100g**

**Calcium: 99.0 mg**

**Iron: 2.7mg**

**Magnesium: 79.0mg**

**Phosphorus: 49.0mg**

**Potassium: 558mg**

**Sodium: 79.0mg**

**Zinc: 0.5mg**

**Copper: 0.1mg**

**Manganese: 0.9mg**

**Selenium: 1.0 mcg**

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some help / additional perspective on comparing these foods etc. The reason I'm comparing microgreens to spinach is because they seem to be interchangeable in salads and sandwiches.

The easiest way to burn fat! When your body is in ketosis, [http://keto-weight-loss.digital-gringo.co.uk](http://keto-weight-loss.digital-gringo.co.uk/),nutrition,1542220594,loftsfirstchoice,1,1,True,2018-11-14
Small cheat meal per day,"Hey guys, 

What is your experience with having a very small cheat snack a day while still staying loyal to your macros ?

I consume something of 200-250 grams of carbs per day and try to consume less than 80 grams of sugar ( that includes fruits, greek yogurt, cottage cheese, honey etc...) Well I found these Biscotis that for 25 grams it only contains 6 grams of sugar and about 15 grams of carbs and I am easily able to fit that in my macros per day. I just started doing it and it satisfy my little sweet craving after lunch. I usually have instant oats with cinnamon with fruits but I need some variety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ask cause I used to be pretty chubby about 6 months ago, I am only 5 feet 8 and I was 184 pounds with 22% body fat. Now I am 153 with 7% body fat and I really fear of going down that road. I have my cheat meals on one saturday or Sunday where I will eat something that has no benefit to me what so ever. 

So 15 grams a day of carbs that fit my macros but aren't really part of my healthy way of eating.. will that really mess things up in the long run ? Or I am fine as long as I maintain my sugar level at that rate and stick to my macros. 

PS: If it helps, I workout between 5-6 times a week at the gym plus 3-5 hours of kickboxing. ",nutrition,1542220604,Sergey1986,1,1,True,2018-11-14
How should an endurance athlete eat to lose weight?,"I’m about 2.5 years into competitive road cycling and I love it! My goal this off-season is to get a bit leaner. I played football and basketball throughout high school and quit lifting in college, but now I cycle 12-16 hours a week. On an average ride, I burn ~775 calories/hour, so close to 11,000 in a week on the bike. My maintenance 

To get to where I want to be, I need to lose a little bit of upper body muscle and a good amount of body fat. 

With energy expenditure like that, can anybody with expertise in nutrition give some guidance on how I should split my calories to be able to have energy to ride while also cutting back?

Fruit consumption and combatting fatty liver disease on a plant based diet?,"I've read various articles that claim consuming lots of fruit can contribute to fatty liver disease, and that those with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) should limit or avoid eating fruit.

This is apparently due to fructose raising triglycerides leading to fat storage within the liver.

However I've also read a few more recent articles that state this hypothesis was based on an older study which has since been disproven.

Clearly fruit is an important part of a plant based diet, so for someone attempting to reverse/combat NAFLD, is fruit a good thing or bad thing? Let's assume the rest of the diet is obviously plant based and low fat (e.g. 80/10/10).

Are simple carbohydrates just as bad as added sugar in terms of fat gain?,"I've demonized added sugar in my head (for good reason - eating added sugar sends me into a craving frenzy) but I never really thought about simple carbs.

"Giving Diet Advice to Dad Post Heart-Attack, Am I doing this right?","I'm taking a nutrition course at my university right now, and my Dad had a heart attack last year at 53, and ever since my family has been concerned about his diet. I'm giving him tips for his diet and I want to make sure I emphasised the right things, and I didn't give me any wrong advice. 

His weight is around 225 at 5' 10 so we're trying to lose some of the weight. I told him to cut calories about 300-400 below his TDEE, and start excersizing 3-4 days a week. He's currently eating at 2400 calories a day, but actually ends up a bit below this most days around 2100 or 2200 calories. 

I told him to eat whole grains (bread or rice), eggs, plain greek yogurt, fruit, vegetables, chicken breast, turkey, black beans, and a few other things. I want to make sure that these are things he can eat on a daily basis, so feel free to provide any criticism.

In terms of what he actually has been eating, he's been eating a breakfast burrito (I think whole grain wrap) with eggs, broccoli, cheese, and salsa (what do you think of this)

For lunch: chicken burrito with broccoli and brown rice

And also he's told he's been eating a lot of steel cut oats.

I'd love some tips on things I'm missing or shit that isn't good with either the advice I gave, or the diet so far

Weight loss question,"This may be a post better suited to /r/askscience but I will try here nonetheless. The scope of the question is that I am a wrestler looking for the most efficient way to make weight but am also curious behind the science and what you guys think. So obviously the only way to lose weight is to take in less calories than you lose. I have been doing this to get down to a certain weight for a while but at some point the calories in will not matter when it comes to making weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example: If I weigh 150 and have to be under 151 to make weight, I can drink 32 oz of water and then be over my weight limit if I immediately step on the scale, even though there are no calories in water. Conversely, I can eat a slice of pizza which has 400 calories, yet still be under the weight limit as I will weigh about 150.5 (all estimates). At what point is it most efficient to worry about only the actual weight of the food vs. the calories in the food. One day before I have to weigh in? 12 hours? 3 hours?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is unclear wording or hard to understand, I had trouble putting this into words as its been something I've been following for a while but never tried to understand it deeper or get into the exact science of it.

From a guy who had his mom force feed him faty acids as a child because he refused to eat them to have recently grown to love them.,"I hate olives and olive oils but i pour that shit on everything and am content, i make a vinegrette with olive oil, white vinegar, raw honey, seasoning &amp; a fucking delicious balsamico, the same goes for vinegar, always use high quality vinegar because those lasts forever and you'll almost never use them(and vinegrette stays good for up to a month!) and pour lots on veggies after they'r cooked and ofc on sallad, 

i pour some plain olive oil in a plastic bag and put the veggies about to be cooked in that and make them get that oil all over, 

i pour some in my amaranth, amaranth has a burny taste already and with a lot of salt it takes away that oily flavour and i actually prefer amaranth with olive oil and can probably eat 400 calories of just that and olive oil in one meal. 

Guacamole is made super easy with a mortel and just add koriander/cilantro, lime, garlic &amp; salt. I've stopped all half and whole fabricates sauces from eating plenty of guacamole alone. 

Not really a fat trick but you can substitute alot of really shit ingredients with real ingredients like Ssamjang, Miso, Curry, Coconut, Sour Cream, Rice Vinegar with liquid smoke, salt, honey &amp; curry is my favorite chicken glaze and the smell is beyond legendary when it comes out every single cell asscociated with smell comes alive describing it just doesn't make it justice, there is also Kokumi which is a liquid form taste enhancer tons of fast food chains like mcdonalds use in their burgers to stimulate our primitive cravings for proteins, a synonym for it is mouthful and it can be described as the instinct we have to go for that meat piece in soup or meat piece in general i would say because most of the time i end up eating all my meat befor i have eaten 50% of the whole plate.

Peanut butter with sugar in it for life! That goes so good with meatballs, easiest 500 calories from just smooth somewhat unhealthy peanut butter and meatballs in a meal. Just calculate a meal befor or after this meal extremely high in protein because you'll probably be pissing pure nitroglyn if you don't.

add 10 gram coconut oil to your millet flakes porridge &amp; make fat bombs with coconut oil, cacao, melted chocolate, macadamia, hazzlenuts, pecan &amp; a few tablestoons of honey and grounded sea salt! 

Pour some Avocado oil over your frypan which will be your most expensive oil but it's the best for cooking. Eat 4 gram of fish oil a day for days you don't eat alot of it.

* I know there may be scope of practice issues (she's in Ohio, if that matters), but navigating them is rather difficult. Can anyone provide any guidance on how to get info on that? Are there going to be legal issues here, giving health-related advice?
* WF says they don't tell people what to do, but that they simply provide research-based information to help people make good decisions. Obviously they do this with the intention of providing specific advice . . . but they say they don't provide advice. Only information. Anyone have experience with anything like that? I have trouble wrapping my head around it.
* Do you have any advice on marketing this sort of business? Research-based non-advice advice? Anything you've seen work well for firing up a new one-person nutrition/lifestyle business?

Any advice you have for this rather weird situation would be hugely appreciated.

(Also, I know that she'd be better able to get clients with a degree or at least a cert, and that WF is super questionable. Trust me, I know. No need to point that out in your answers.)",nutrition,1542371968,dr_albright,28,3,True,2018-11-16

Seeking Advise on how to Manage the Metabolic Stresses of Occasional Binge Eating,[removed],nutrition,1542382759,MakesNotSense,1,1,True,2018-11-16
Seeking Advise on Managing the Metabolic Stress of Occasionally Eating a lot of Ice Cream/Junk Food,"I'm a habitual eater of real foods with lots of vegetables/etc - a paragon of good eating, except for about every four to eight weeks or so I skip breakfast and gorge on ice cream or something else truly terrible for one's health for lunch while watching a movie. I mean, a lot of ice cream. I've downed almost 5 pints of hagen daas/ben &amp; jerry's/etc in one sitting before.

I always feel this mix of really good and pretty awful a few hours later, and it usually takes a few days to recover in terms of increased inflammation, changes in cognition, and mood.

I'm wondering, is there a way to make this occasional indulgence less stressful metabolically? It's a lot of sugar there. I've thought of taking 1000mg of ascorbic acid 30minues prior to eating, but I don't know if that's going to really help much, and surely there would be more that could be done in terms of limiting the damage being done metabolically. Like, the liver having to deal with all that fructose, the pancreas producing all the enzymes for the fats/proteins/sugars/insulin, and microbiome of the small intestine digesting all the free sugars - just wanted to be clear I wasn't simply concerned with serum glucose levels.

What has helped you and are some ways you've fit in enough food and nutrition to keep your body going when it's hard to eat (e.g. sickness, moods, general appetite loss). When you have little appetite, sometimes it's easy to forget or not eat enough but your body doesn't like that.

Are there even some pre-made snacks that help you eat on the go? Like Cliff Bars or Cheese?

Bonus for getting veggies/produce in without them spoiling by the time you can finish them all.

Like, the liver having to deal with all that fructose, the pancreas producing all the enzymes for the fats/proteins/sugars/insulin, and the microbiome of the small intestine digesting all the free sugars.

Is there any risk in eating 50 grams of Spirulina daily?,"I searched through the first few pages of hits on spirulina and didn't notice anyone asking this, so here it goes, a teaching moment! I have looked into protein powders and seen evidence that the vast majority of them, regardless of purity and contamination free claims, still have traces of heavily metals and other nasty things. Pre work outs are probably even sketchier because they require the assemblage of many processed ingredients that may or may not happen under the supervision of the brand that is packaging and marketing them. 

So, I have seen the list of beneficial compounds in Spirulina and a ton of the ingredients from pre workout mixes are already in Spirulina, as well as a lot of other supplements that are sold for body building are naturally present. However, some of these ingredients are present in low amounts and it would take 30 to 50 grams to get in the suggested amounts for best benefits for body building.

Can you increase mayonnaise in calorie restrictions diets without creating health effects?,"I work long days so I'm pretty tired by the time I get off. I just want something quick and potentially healthy. Subway is relatively cheap for a poor person like me while allowing me plenty of veggies, protein, and good carbs.

However I only eat a Greek yogurt (120 calories) for the entire day prior to this, and Subway is my last meal. The average footlong there with cheese, olive oil, and (average amount of) mayo is around 1100 calories. Combined with my yogurt that's only like 1200 calories.

Now I love mayonnaise, but I'd like to eat somewhat healthy and calorie restricted. I understand people say mayonnaise is bad for you as far as calories. However, in and of itself, calories aside, is it detrimental to your body to increase mayonnaise a) because it taste awesome and b) because 1200 calories isn't enough and this will help me increase my calories while not increasing the price? 

I still have a calorie deficit, but I dont know if it is damaging my body in other ways because of it's high oil make up. Thanks!",nutrition,1542452180,deepinterwebz,16,1,True,2018-11-17

"Optimal dose of Aged Garlic Extract to decrease inflammation, induce angiogenesis (by increasing H2S and NO to optimal levels)?","Aged Garlic Extract (AGE) is a type of garlic extract where raw garlic is aged in water/ethanol for 20 months. This results in the formation of water-soluble H2S-donor molecules (like S-Allyl-Cysteine), along with the loss of fat soluble H2S-donors, which give raw garlic its pungent smell (which is why AGE is odorless).

****

AGE was shown to reduce blood pressure, have vasodilating properties, and decrease inflammation, similarly to raw garlic consumption. The effects of both AGE and raw garlic are likely caused by their increase in Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Nitric Oxide (NO). The increase in H2S and NO also stimulates angiogenesis, which can improve the healing of chronic wounds/injuries.

I am planning on buying the Kyolic brand (I was disappointed to see that it's pretty much one of the only that are sold). 

Both Raw Garlic and AGE seem to exert hormetic effects - if so, what is the optimal dose for maximally increasing H2S and NO? [This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3561616/) says that for blood pressure reduction, 480mg worked better than both 240mg and 960mg, suggesting a U-shaped curve of effects. However, this is only for blood pressure, and this might be different for other effects.

There appears to be a U-shaped curve with Raw Garlic, as well: as can be [seen here](https://i.gyazo.com/933bbf1a501816f815778d2cb7ad2238.png), 2g of Raw Garlic worked better than both 1g and 4g in increasing plasma NO levels ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17523869)). Again, 2g is the optimal dose for NO increase, but this could be different regarding other effects.

1. With a focus on nutrient quality, good health and low chronic disease risk can be achieved for many people on diets with a broad range of carbohydrate-to-fat ratios.

2. Replacement of saturated fat with naturally occurring unsaturated fats provides health benefits for the general population. Industrially produced trans fats are harmful and should be eliminated. The metabolism of saturated fat may differ on carbohydrate-restricted diets, an issue that requires study.

3. Replacement of highly processed carbohydrates (including refined grains, potato products, and free sugars) with unprocessed carbohydrates (nonstarchy vegetables, whole fruits, legumes, and whole or minimally processed grains) provides health benefits.

4. Biological factors appear to influence responses to diets of differing macronutrient composition. People with relatively normal insulin sensitivity and β cell function may do well on diets with a wide range of carbohydrate-to-fat ratios; those with insulin resistance, hypersecretion of insulin, or glucose intolerance may benefit from a lower-carbohydrate, higher-fat diet.

5. A ketogenic diet may confer particular metabolic benefits for some people with abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, a possibility that requires long-term study.

6. Well-formulated low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets do not require high intakes of protein or animal products. Reduced carbohydrate consumption can be achieved by substituting grains, starchy vegetables, and sugars with nonhydrogenated plant oils, nuts, seeds, avocado, and other high-fat plant foods.

7. There is broad agreement regarding the fundamental components of a healthful diet that can serve to inform policy, clinical management, and individual dietary choice. Nonetheless, important questions relevant to the epidemics of diet-related chronic disease remain. Greater investment in nutrition research should assume a high priority.",nutrition,1542577008,35mmFILM,3,1,True,2018-11-18

Biotin, MSM powder, Protein, Bamboo extract etc. Im reading various user reviews of various products on various websites (like amazon etc.). Im aiming mainly for a product that will help my hair look overall better, and if possible will start grow of new hair (where there wasnt any at any point or where there were but they might have fallen out with age a bit (im 30)). Im  NOT looking to improve the speed of growth  of my hair. Im always comming across people writing (in english) that this and that product made their hair ""Thicker""... or ""thick""... But im Not sure what does that mean...

1) Do they mean (in general, does it mean in english), that each of their already existing hair-strand got much ""thicker"", wider in diameter (after using the supplement)?

2) Or do people mean (when referring to ""thick hair"", ""my hair has gotten thicker"" etc.), that they actually have GROWN MORE new hair strands, and that their overall hair looks ""thicker"" due to this- that means they have more newly grown strands of individual hair...?

Which one is it?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

Reversing NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) - conflicting views on optimal way of eating.,"Lots of posts on this sub and studies/articles out there which seem to contradict each other. What is the best way to reverse NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease)?

* On one hand, a popular view seems to be that a low carb/ketogenic diet is the most effective way to reverse NAFLD due to low sugar/carb intake. There are a few studies quoted on this sub in which participants reduce their liver fat content within a short period of time whilst eating a low carb diet.

* On the other hand, I've certainly read a lot of articles and viewpoints on here that hold the view a low fat/low sat fat diet (whole food plant-based diet) reduces the fat content of the liver during weight loss.

Completely conflicting. Are there any solid/reliable sources or studies that back either view?

Will de novo lipogenesis (conversion of carbs/sugar to fat) still happen if a person just ate at a calorie deficit? (so no excess carbs/energy?),"If someone was to eat at a calorie deficit (let's say they were only eating 1400kcals per day), is de novo lipogenesis still an issue or impossible?

Taking it to an extreme level, lets say the 1400kcals was high carb, low fat (80/10/10) with high fruit intake (high fructose) - with so much carbohydrate/sugar, can de novo lipogenesis still happen?

My understanding was that only *excess* energy from carbs/sugars was converted to fat for storage, so if someone was eating much less than maintenence calories, there would be no risk of this?

Obviously there could be other consequences/effects, but strictly talking DNG here.

As a side question (but still connected), would this also mean that there would be no risk of liver fat build up?

Is eating table sugar good for my brain?,[removed],nutrition,1542809708,chaser2718,2,1,True,2018-11-21
"Is eating table sugar(Sucrose) healthy for the brain, and would it have a beneficial impact on studying?","Hello friends. I did a quick research myself on this topic and its indicated that the answer to this question may be a resounding yes. However I am a layman and would like your expert opinion!


My daily sugar intake is relatively low; I dont eat chocolate, sweets and such. I try to stay 100% natural. The only sweet thing I may eat daily are honey and fruits. So, with that in mind, my question is as follows...


Would it be beneficent for a person who is studying to eat a small dose of table sugar or even honey every hour as a means to fuel the brain?  I am not good in nutritional facts but it seems that glucose is the main power source of our brain, yes?

Balance between Carbs and Fats,"I know that saturated fat is generally bad for heart health, and that excess carbs can contribute to high blood sugar and diabetes, which leads me to my question: what can/should you really eat, then?  I've known a few people who flip/flop between high fat/low carb and low fat/high carb diets, and it just seems to shift their health issues from one end of the spectrum (high cholesterol) to the other (high blood sugar).

&amp;#x200B;

If you try to follow a diet low in saturated fat to improve heart health, then that shifts you towards eating significantly more carbs to balance out the calories, which can drive your blood sugar up.  I guess you technically ""can"" get more calories from protein, but I've heard that that can come with its own issues, such as being really hard on your kidneys. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you try to cut back on carbs/sugar, then that shifts you towards eating more high-fat foods, which also significantly increases your saturated fat intake.  I say this because as far as I know, any of the foods that contain healthy, unsaturated fats (such as nuts, olive oil, fish, etc.) also contain a pretty decent amount of saturated fat, so if you get all of your calories from those sources you end up taking in a ton of saturated fat along with it.  The majority of low-carb diets I see use a ton of coconut oil and heavy cream, which most health sources suggest is a major no-no.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the best way to manage the carb/fat ratio to maximize heart health vs. blood sugar?  Are there any foods that are high in healthy fats, but contain no (or very low) levels of saturated fat?",nutrition,1542814488,Parafault,24,1,True,2018-11-21

Helping your body get used to whole foods again (especially tons of fruits and beans),"So I went on a school trip to Rome recently. And as I imagined it to be in a group of friends that don't want to go to fancy restaurants, I had a LOT of unhealthy foods like candy, crackers, chocolate and take-away.

At home I only eat whole foods with a big focus on fruits and grains (vegan). I feel like my body got used to eating this kind of stuff as it can be quite hard on your digestion, especially with a lot of beans and seeds. So I didn't have any problems before the trip. 

Now that I'm back home I realized that my digestive system just can't handle food they way it used to, I feel really bloated when I eat a larger amount, I'd suddenly have to use the bathroom almost instantly after I had finished eating — and I dont want to tell you what happened there. 

MY QUESTION IS: How much time does it take your digestive system to get used to a whole foods high fiber diet high carb diet again after eating junk for a week? I just want to be able to enjoy my food again! Thanks for the help..

Is there a way to make myself like veggies?,"Basically what the title says. 

Background info: the odd thing is, as a kid, I would at the very least tolerate most veggies I was served (save for broccoli, squash, and cauliflower). I especially loved spinach, peas, celery, green beans (if they count), radishes, carrots, and zucchini.

As I've gotten older though, I actually like less and less veggies as time goes on, and at my current age, I'll only eat:

Zucchini (only fried)

Carrots (only raw or in stew)

Potatoes (if they count in this)

Radishes (only raw)

Lettuce (not a fan but I can deal with it better than most others)



And with the radishes and raw carrots, I have to force myself to choke them down. I still love potatoes and fried zucchini (i used to eat it prepared other ways) though. Any other vegetable? as soon as I taste it, I typically vomit, or at the very least, gag, choke down another bite or two, and get so close to throwing up that I have to stop. But hey, I love 90% of fruits I've tried if that makes up for anything.

I'm not against trying vegetables, and I honestly wish I liked them or could at least tolerate them like I used to. I've tried preparing them and had so many friends or family members cook veggies in tons of different ways for me with various seasonings (I know roasting vegetables is popular, but I've never had a roasted vegetable I've enjoyed cooked by anyone). It's taste and texture both for me. No matter how they're prepared, I hate the taste, and while the texture is slightly better with some cooking methods, I tend to always hate it too.

It just seems so odd to me that as I get older, I like less vegetables. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? No one even believes me when I say I wasn't like this as a kid. Am I limited to choking down radishes and carrots my whole life because they're the only ones I can eat without throwing up?

How easy is it for our bodies to digest and assimilate powder foods?,"Is it taxing on the systems or nice and smooth to assimilate? Taxing on any particular organ? Would the full load be used or would a certain amount be disregarded? Of course I'm only seeking a broad answer. The word depends goes without saying.

Half a tablespoon of Moringa powder and half a tablespoon of WheatGrass powder with a pinch of Turmeric and Black P as a little extra every morning goes a long way right?",nutrition,1542983674,ConsciousChimp,7,1,True,2018-11-23
Why are powdered juices classified as unhealthy?,"I know that artificial sugar is the main against argument, but that is also contained in regular juices boxes bought in supermarkets. Exception would be the 100% natural versions. And still there is fructose that as far as I know is also converted in sugar after digestion.

So would it even make it healthier if the source is natural rather than artificial or that is advocated without scientific evidence and based purely in the appeal to nature?

Also while reading the nutritional information, for example of Tang's drink and comparing with juice boxes, their Vitamin C in relation to price content, was basically the same and there was additional Zinc and vitamin D in Tang.

As a side note I understand that eating fruits is better because they have fibers, but for many, drinks are a convenient way of getting their Vitamins so I would like to keep the discussion between natural and powdered juice.",nutrition,1542990945,PabloDx,14,1,True,2018-11-23

6 Health and Nutrition Tips that are Proven to be Vital,"Maintaining your health requires you to have a proper diet, exercise regularly and have good sleep. Those who keep track of their fitness have to rarely see a doctor. However, those who ignore these things might have to visit the [Urgent Care Center](https://www.urgentway.com/locations/urgent-care-bronx/), Emergency Room or Doctor to get the treatment according to their condition. It is better to spend some money on buying fruits, vegetables, and nuts instead of wasting your money on medications and paying doctor’s fee.  

If you want to avoid all those hassles of visiting a doctor and paying a high fee, make sure to read nutrition and healthy lifestyle tips. Let’s get started.

**Don’t Take Sugar Calories**

Sugar especially the artificial one is quite dangerous for your health. Whether you drink soft drinks, eat bakery delights or munch cookies every day, you are taking sugar calories that might harm your health. For instance, sugary drinks are linked to obesity, heart diseases, and type 2 diabetes.

**Eat Nuts**

Nuts are no doubt high in fat, but they are a healthy form of diet and contain nutrition that is necessary for the body. Studies show that nuts can help you fight type 2 diabetes, lose weight and reduce the risk of heart disease. Moreover, nuts can boost metabolism in the body as 10 to 15% of the calories are not absorbed in the body.

**Get Enough Sleep**

Having quality sleep can never be ignored. The purpose of sleep is to refresh your body and it is as important as a good diet and exercise. Poor sleep can disrupt your appetite hormones, reduce physical and mental performance, and drive insulin resistance. Poor sleep can also encourage weight gain and obesity. A study shows that short sleep was linked to 89% increased risk of obesity in children and 55% in adults.

**Drink Plenty of Water**

Drinking water can help you stay healthy and hydrated. Water plays a vital role in flushing away toxins. It can help boost the number of calories you burn. According to a study, water can boost metabolism by 24-30% over a period of one to one and a half hours. The ideal time to drink water is half an hour before meals. One study shows that half a liter of water, 30 minutes prior to meal increased weight loss by 44%

**Take Vitamin D**

Sunlight is a good source of Vitamin D, but if you are living in colder areas, you might not get enough sunlight. In the olden times, people got their vitamin D from the sun. The problem nowadays is that most people stay inside their home. According to the data from 2005-06, about 41.6 percent of the US population is deficient in this critical vitamin.

**Eat Vegetables and Fruits**

Vegetables and fruits are essential for the body to feed it with vitamins and proteins. They are loaded with minerals, antioxidants, vitamins and prebiotic fiber which ultimately leads to a positive impact on health.

Studies show that people who eat fruits and vegetables live longer and are at lower risk of being prey to type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.",nutrition,1543001934,BethreePk,1,1,True,2018-11-23

Keto. Low carb. Paleo. Low FODMAP. Low acid. Fast track. Which diet is best for digestive health?,"I’ve been greatly interested in nutrition the last year since I’ve started developing digestive issues and non-life threatening food allergies and intolerances. I’m starting to drive myself practically nuts reading and trying out so many different diets, trying to figure out which is really best for ones digestive health. And trying to uncover answers to the following questions:

-is sugar really “toxic”?
-is gluten really bad for you?
-can a high fat diet exacerbate GERD/acid reflux?

Etc...the thing is I feel I react differently to different foods sometimes. I’ve been taking probiotics for about 2 months now, especially after a doctor’s recommendation. My doctor didn’t recommend Keto and said it’s not sustainable. 

At the end of the day, I really am starting to dislike trying to figure out which “diet” is best, because it takes so much effort thinking about which food works for it or not and it’s exhausting. I don’t wanna think that much about food. 

How does one approach all this from a nutritional standpoint? Is there objectively any “best” diet for one’s digestive health? Is gluten really bad for you? The list of questions goes on...",nutrition,1543010903,throwaway75643218,2,1,True,2018-11-23
How to get enough calcium and not overdose on other vitamins on vegan diet?," 

Ok, serious nutrition question: how do I get enough calcium and not overdo other vitamins on a vegan diet? I read that one of the best calcium sources on a vegan diet is green leafy veggies, among which one of the best one is bok choi.

I checked the vitamin/mineral composition of it and if I want to get enough calcium from bok choi in a day, I will take in approx. 700% DV of vitamin A and 350% of vitamin K. I read that overdoing vitamins is not a good thing and can lead to serious health effects. What am I missing here? How do I get proper amount of calcium without overdoing other vitamins?

"Why would someone get itchy skin a lot, and especially after eating?","I have itchy skin which is often more noticeable after eating or drinking (coffee and soda), and after waking up in the morning. Most of the time it’s just a little annoying, but sometimes it drives me crazy. It’s worse on my face and scalp and sometimes feels like pinpricks or bug bites. The other day it occurred after eating cheese. There doesn’t seem to be any particular food setting it off though.

I’ve thought it might be related to my IBS as having a flare up is when the itching is more noticeable. But I guess that could just be a coincidence too.

Another concern is that I have an alcohol addiction, and yeah I know it’s not meant to be good for IBS, but I had 3 months of sobriety last year and my IBS didn’t improve, and nor did the itching go away.

However, there were many studies in the last couple of years that proved high protein diets, that can be high in processed and red meat  can be dangerous in  the long term use (1).  In the last decade, concerns have been raised about the possibility that  eating red meat and processed meat may increase the risk of  cancer. The summary of all cancer studies that were done by the World Cancer Research  Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research in 2007 concluded that the available scientific evidence was convincing that the consumption of  processed and unprocessed red meat could potentially lead to colorectal cancer (2).  For those patients that already have tumors identified as advanced  stage at diagnosis (10 cohorts),  there was a stronger positive association observed especially for men in North America (RRpooled 1.19, 95% CI 1.01–1.40 for the consumption of ≥100 g day−1 vs. &lt;20 g day−1 unprocessed red meat) (2).

Another study among mice and humans showed the correlation between growth hormone receptor/IGF-1 and animal protein intake in age-related diseases (3). Because protein restriction in diet reduces GHR-IGF-1 activity, the study examined links between protein intake and  mortality. Respondents aged 50–65 that had reported high protein intake had a  75% increase in overall mortality and an increase in cancer death  risk (3). These associations were nearly  abolished if the proteins derived from the plant based source.  However, it was also discovered that conversely,  high protein intake was associated with reduced cancer and overall  mortality in respondents that were over 65. Mouse studies confirmed the effect of high  protein intake and increase in GHR-IGF-1 signaling on the incidence and potential progression  of breast and melanoma tumors. These results suggest that low protein  intake during middle age followed by medium to high protein  consumption in old adults may increase longevity and overall health status.

There were several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why consumption of red meat can lead to cancer. The main evidence for that can be seen from the examining of the digestive tract.  One of the components of red meat, haeme  plays a role in cancer development (2).  Additionally free iron is present in red meat and in the intestinal mucosa. Free ferrous iron is released from the haeme molecule and can lead to an increase production of ROS, especially H2O2, which can lead to inflammation and genetic mutations in the  body. Red meat consumption has also been  shown to initiate epigenetic changes in DNA (2).  There is still not enough evidence for poultry, eggs and fish. However, the way animal products are cooked like cured meats that could lead to  colorectal cancer, grilled, barbecued, and fried meats could be  possible cause of colorectal cancer as well. Furthermore, grilling and barbecuing could be a possible cause of stomach cancer as well (1).

Article in Nutrients suggest that a certain proportion of patients may effectively develop tolerance to gluten and thus become suitable for gluten reintroduction over time,"The gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment available for  celiac disease. However, it is difficult to adhere to and a closer look  on the diet’s implementation and indications reveals several  ambiguities: Not only is there controversy on the threshold of gluten  that can be tolerated in the frame of a strict gluten-free diet, but it  is also unclear whether the gluten-free diet is an appropriate treatment  in patient subgroups with asymptomatic or potential celiac disease.  Reports from a number of research groups suggest that a certain  proportion of patients may effectively develop tolerance to gluten and  thus become suitable for gluten reintroduction over time. In this  review, we set out to create an overview about the current state of  research as regards the definition of a strict gluten-free diet in terms  of the gluten thresholds considered tolerable and the indication for a  gluten-free diet in the absence of histological abnormalities or  symptoms.

What accounts for these very different nutritional profiles on what appears to be the same food? Does the Costco label possibly consider only insoluble fibers?

Protein is King Of Nutrients When It Comes To Losing Weight," 

Each one of your meals should include a protein source, a fat source, and low-carb vegetables.

Constructing your meals in this way will automatically bring your carb intake into the recommended range of 20–50 grams per day.

### Protein Sources

* **Meat:** Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc.
* **Fish and Seafood:** Salmon, trout, shrimp, etc.
* **Eggs:** Whole eggs with the yolk are best.

The importance of eating a lot of protein cannot be overstated.

This has been shown to boost metabolism by 80 to 100 calories per day ([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19640952), [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11838888), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565999)).

High-protein diets can also reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%, reduce the desire for late-night snacking by half, and make you so full that you automatically eat 441 fewer calories per day — just by **adding** protein to your diet ([9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20847729), [10](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/1/41/4863422)).

When it comes to losing weight, protein is the king of nutrients. Period.

WTF?! 304 lbs and gained weight eating ave 1600 cal/day,"I am so frustrated I'm about to lose my mind. 3+ weeks ago with a personal trainer who does small, super intense HIIT/boot camp classes. I've been going 4 days a week.

As for diet, focused on lean protein, moderate complex carbs and fat. I've been weighing and measuring everything that goes in my mouth. Drink only black coffee, water and plain seltzer. I've been looging in Myfitnesspal, my diary is open, Shelbygeorge29.

I'm 43 W, struggled with weight my whole life. Lost 80 in my mid 20s and kept it off for 7 years. I was a very intense w working out and diet was tight.  Got sick and stopped working out, life kind of happened and I gained it all back and then some, brining me to today.

Every time I try to lose weight it is so hard. I'm at 304, you would think that with my activity level and my diet, again, between 1500-1900 cals a day, with a BMR of 2100. Weight should be flying off me at this point, especially since I'm at the very beginning. I'm nowhere near plateau stage. 

On MFP, the concensus is I need to up my calories, but that just doesnt make sense. I'm not at starvation mode or adaptive thermogenesis. I gained a frigging pound this week. Didn't eat any Thanksgiving whatsoever, just treated it like a regular Thursday. 

Oh, and trainer claims i gained 4 lbs of muscle. In the last week. Umm, that doesn't seem possible, especially running at such a high deficit. 

In addition to the gym, I've way upped my NEAT, making sure I was moving a lot throughout the day. I work as a bartender at a very busy bar 4 nights a week. Prior to this I was very sedentary when not working. Since I've started, I have been running at a huge daily caloric deficit, killing it at the gym 60 mins/4× a week and moving way, way more. I'm just baffled.

WTF should i do? Something doesn't make sense. ",nutrition,1543336953,shelbygeorge29,1,1,True,2018-11-27

"a different opinion on ""eating healthy""","Eating ""healthy"" can mean a lot of different things. In general, I think most people would agree that eating ""healthy"" usually meaning consuming a lower-calorie, plant-based diet with few processed foods. Furthermore, I think most people believe these diets are healthy because they are ""packed with vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.""

However, I argue that the main health benefits from this type of diet comes from NOT eating unhealthy food. The average american diet is unhealthy mostly due to caloric excess and high fat content, but very few people are actually nutrient deficient. The vitamins and minerals received from eating ""healthy"" plant-food will mostly pass through your system be filtered into your urine. In contrast, not eating high amounts of animal fats and calorie-dense foods (sweets) is more important than the vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals once receives from eating plant food. **Thus, the term ""eating healthy"" is probably more accurately described as ""eating neutral"".** One important exception is the extra fiber in plant-based food, which actually has been shown to have a positive, beneficial effect on health.

In summary, the benefits of ""eating healthy"" come from not eating unhealthy foods and is better described as ""eating neutral.""

"I am scared, because my vitamin D levels are so low!","26-year-old female from Northern Europe. 5' 11"" and 170 lbs. Severe iron deficiency and severe vitamin D deficiency. Osteopenia as well. 

My values came back like this: 

- **D3 = 4.7 ng/mL**

- **D2 = 2.7 ng/mL**

I have health anxiety, so I'm really worried that my severe vitamin D deficiency will permanently harm my health - even if I'm able to correct it. I mean, I fear that having gone with low vitamin D levels for a long time has permanently damaged my overall health. My worst fear is that it will cut at least a decade of my life.

Another thing is that insufficient vitamin D levels and osteopenia both increase the risk of fractures. I fell and got a concussion a couple months ago.

* A low carb/ketogenic diet (low carb/low fructose with the body becoming fat-adapted and in a state optimal to use fat as energy, therefore reducing liver fat)

Randomized Trial: Saturated Fat Is More Metabolically Harmful for the Human Liver Than Unsaturated Fat or Simple Sugars.,"[Link to study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29844096)

OBJECTIVE:

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e., increased intrahepatic triglyceride [IHTG] content), predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are the main pathways contributing to IHTG. We hypothesized that dietary macronutrient composition influences the pathways, mediators, and magnitude of weight gain-induced changes in IHTG.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:

We overfed 38 overweight subjects (age 48 ± 2 years, BMI 31 ± 1 kg/m2, liver fat 4.7 ± 0.9%) 1,000 extra kcal/day of saturated (SAT) or unsaturated (UNSAT) fat or simple sugars (CARB) for 3 weeks. We measured IHTG (1H-MRS), pathways contributing to IHTG (lipolysis ([2H5]glycerol) and DNL (2H2O) basally and during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia), insulin resistance, endotoxemia, plasma ceramides, and adipose tissue gene expression at 0 and 3 weeks.

RESULTS:

Overfeeding SAT increased IHTG more (+55%) than UNSAT (+15%, P &lt; 0.05). CARB increased IHTG (+33%) by stimulating DNL (+98%). SAT significantly increased while UNSAT decreased lipolysis. SAT induced insulin resistance and endotoxemia and significantly increased multiple plasma ceramides. The diets had distinct effects on adipose tissue gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS:

Macronutrient composition of excess energy influences pathways of IHTG: CARB increases DNL, while SAT increases and UNSAT decreases lipolysis. SAT induced the greatest increase in IHTG, insulin resistance, and harmful ceramides. Decreased intakes of SAT could be beneficial in reducing IHTG and the associated risk of diabetes.",nutrition,1543459250,julry,41,1,True,2018-11-28

[advice] Just won't get full unless I eat garbage.,"Hello all, I've tried several times to clean up the diet to no avail.

This is starting to drive me mad, I just want to be able to eat sensibly without feeling tired / weak. I am not starving myself and most people would consider it a nice and big-ish breakfast, yet here I am. Had I gotten some fast food I'd be satiated for, not long, but at least longer than an hour.

Smelling... Vegetably?,"Something I noticed about the ultra healthy kids when I was growing up was that they had a very distinct body aroma to them. It was like that of a room temperature veggie plate of cauliflower, broccoli, and bell peppers. (I'm really hoping at least one other person knows what I mean???)

It's a scent that I associate with ""healthy"" living, people who eat all fruits and veggies servings in a day, probably more, exercise, etc. Anyway, I've noticed now I'm beginning to smell that way since changing my diet in the last year. One of the biggest changes and observed habits of the ""healthy"" kids, was the limited (refined/cane) sugar intake.

I'm wondering if it's an increase in vegetable consumption that causes this new aroma? Or simply cutting out sugar and allowing the body to just smell different? My BO on a high sugar / low real foods diet was bad, and I did perspire more then. Has anyone else who has cut out sugar, increased veggie intake, and continued to exercise regularly experienced smelling differently?

"PLEASE READ DETAILS BELOW; THIS ISN'T A STUPID, OBVIOUS QUESTION, I PROMISE: Does physical exercise matter in terms of how much protein I should be getting everyday?","I'm currently disciplining myself to working out every other day, and so far it's been going okay, but my goal of wanting to get bigger is still in the works. This is why I've been tracking how much protein I'm getting everyday (not too precisely, but just roughly enough to get a long-term picture). Today was my workout day, and I was pretty satisfied with my protein intake, until I suddenly felt very bloated after drinking my protein shake and threw up, right after working out and about an hour after dinner. I did some rough calculations, and I estimated that today's very protein-rich consumption has now been cut down to about 70 grams of protein intake -- not bad for an average, sedentary lifestyle, but not good for someone like me working out and trying to build muscle.

My plan is to simply compensate for it by consuming more protein tomorrow. However, my question is: How much less effective, if less effective at all, is having to compensate with more protein on an off day versus getting a lot of protein on the day of or even right after working out? Will it do me all that much good in terms of muscle growth if I go for a workout level of protein intake on a sedentary day? If not, should I not bother and instead just consume not as much protein tomorrow, but try for more protein the day after, when I work out again?",nutrition,1543552579,assbaring69,1,1,True,2018-11-29

Normal LDL-Cholesterol Levels Are Associated With Subclinical Atherosclerosis in the Absence of Risk Factors,"http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/70/24/2979

“RESULTS: Subclinical atherosclerosis (plaque or coronary artery calcification) was present in 49.7% of CVRF-free participants. Together with male sex and age, LDL-C was independently associated with atherosclerosis presence and extent, in both the CVRF-free and CVRF-optimal groups (odds ratio [×10 mg/dl]: 1.14 to 1.18; p &lt; 0.01 for all). Atherosclerosis presence and extent was also associated in the CVRF-free group with glycosylated hemoglobin levels.”

“CONCLUSIONS: Many CVRF-free middle-aged individuals have atherosclerosis. LDL-C, even at levels currently considered normal, is independently associated with the presence and extent of early systemic atherosclerosis in the absence of major CVRFs. These findings support more effective LDL-C lowering for primordial prevention, even in individuals conventionally considered at optimal risk.

“Too much fat is bad for you”,"Please delete if rants aren’t appropriate 

So I work as support staff in a school UK 
 and sometimes I have to take PSHE l(personal health social and economic) lessons. I was asked to deliver a lesson on nutrition. All of the slide were provided for me... 

One of the slides asked “why is too much fat bad for you?” And the provided answer was “it clogs your arteries”

This really grinded my gears. To say the least. 

by definition TOO MUCH of anything is bad for you. Of course it is. Too much, implies... more than what is healthy. That concept in itself is hard to explain to 11 year olds.(I mean too much water is bad for you because... it’s TOO MUCH)

But I’m so tired of people demonising fat. This PowerPoint slide implied that people should avoid fat. I did not want to send that message to a group of impressionable year 7s. So I told them to ignore it. 

I told them a table spoon of olive oil on a salad or a pat of butter on a potato is much healthier for them than a bottle of coke (which has 0 fat). I hope they took that in. 

I’m sorry, this is rant but the idea that fat causes heart disease and diabetes is so out dated it really annoys me that it is still being taught in schools.

School diet.,"Hello! I’m about to start grad school for clinical psychology in the spring and I thought it would help me to craft a healthy/nutritionally complete/easy/on-the-go/affordable/vegetarian diet plan to eat on the four days out of the week that I will be going to school. I have a lot of requirements and preferences so this is something I’m trying to get down pat before school starts. I’m going to eat the same things on those days with slight variations. 
I tried to base the nutrition on getting 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables, getting enough fiber, protein, and trying to hit the daily dozen. I didn’t account for carbs but I think it’s fine. 
Overall, the calories come out to roughly 1600. I am a 5’8 22 year old female so I think that amount is good (trying to shed a little as I’m overweight) 
Eventually, after I go to the store, I can calculate the cost. I anticipate that the plan will be reasonably affordable. Hopefully other people who have specifications like mine can use it too. 
Please let me know if you think this is a good diet plan. What do you think I should change? Is there anything essential missing? 
I’m just genuinely interested in nutrition and would enjoy feedback. I’m learning! Thank you!

Vitamin K is known as best vitamin for dark circles because vitamin K improves the blood circulation and heals the damaged arteries. When blood circulation increases, your skin start glowing and dark circles are reduced day by day. Vitamin K enriched foods are cabbage, cucumber, lettuce, spring onions, Brussels sprouts and spinach. Add these in your diet and make your diet nutritious for getting healthy skin free from dark circles.  
   
Consuming vitamin C rich diet also helps to get rid of dark circles under eyes and makes your skin fresh and glowing. Broccoli, cauliflower, oranges, strawberries, red and green chili papers are rich sources of vitamin C.  
   
Vitamin E works as an antioxidant in the body which fights against free radicals in the body and kill them, free radicals makes you dull and reduces the glowness of your skin, if you will add vitamin E in your diet it will protect the natural glowness of skin.

You can also take benefit from used tea bags. Refrigerate tea bags over night and then place on the eyes for 10 minutes. It will help to reduce dark circles. Tea contains a compound “Tannin”. It reduces the skin discoloration.  
   
Fresh mint leaves give your skin a soothing effect and removes dark circles. Simply crush mint leaves. Apply it under eyes for at least ten minutes and then rinse off. ",nutrition,1543675958,renaops,1,1,True,2018-12-01

Nutrition during 6 months of antibiotic treatment?,"Hello everyone!

Long story short, I've had quite a few medical issues since August of this year. One of these issues has been osteomyelitis, or a deep bone infection. While waiting on a diagnosis of this issue, I had been on antibiotics for nearly 4 months. Now, post-diagnosis, I am on an intensive antibiotic track (four doses a day) for another 6 weeks. 

This has severe side effects on my digestion and energy levels throughout the day. As a teacher, I cannot spend long periods of time in the restroom (as most working adults!) However, that's how it's been going with this treatment. Additionally, I am suffering from severe lethargy, and am having trouble staying awake after 6pm.

I was wondering if this sub had any recommendations on what I could eat to improve my digestive health or energy during this time? Or, if anyone who had gone through anything similar has advice? I am already taking a probiotic, eating fermented and probiotic foods, and drinking plenty of water (3-4L a day). Should I cut sugar or increase any other type of nutrient?

Common polyphenols possibly genotoxic/mutagenic.,"So I just stumbled upon the fact that a lot of phenols like EGCG, resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, fisetin, genistein, apigenin, luteolin, olive oil phenols, black cumin phenols, etc., are potent human topoisomerase poisons. I'm just baffled nobody's talking about this, since TOPO inhibitors/poisons are chemotherapeutic compounds known to directly interfere and damage the integrity of DNA and thus cause the apoptosis of cancerous cells. This might be OK if we're battling an ongoing cancer, but as far as I understand, wreaking havoc in the genome (messing with the enzyme that protects DNA structure), is not the best way to keep or enhance our health. It's no coincidence that pharmaceutical TOPO inhibitors are often successful at killing tumors, but then lead to other malignant growths in the body. All of the aforementioned phenols poison TOPO and form DNA cleavage complexes, triggering similar genotoxic events. After all most of them act as defense mechanisms in plants, so that pests don't ingest them. Maybe we're not supposed to either. If anyone here has studied this subject intensively, let's discuss. And please prove that my fears are unsubstantiated, otherwise it seems to me that we all have been incorporating massive amounts of these presumably genotoxic and mutagenic wolf-in-sheep's-clothing chemicals throughout our entire lives. Not good.

I have recently started eating vegetables and some fruits, cutting them up and eating them raw as a meal.

I don't notice the effects of dieting.,"People often eat particular things to experience certain effects but I've never noticed anything like this for myself.

Here are some examples:

Carb loading before runs does nothing for me - I don't notice an increase in energy or anything. Meanwhile all my running buddies are loading up on carbs to experience ""benefits"" before races.

I don't have sugar rushes or crashes. I can eat a box of donuts without feeling any change. Are sugar rushes/crashes even real?

I tried keto for a while because lots of people talk about how amazing it feels. I did it for about 6 months, usually averaging under 30 carbs per day with a *high* daily activity level, and I didn't notice a single change in how I felt.

Fruit and veggies don't make me feel any better than a cheeseburger or other unhealthy meal does, although everyone always talks like it should. 

I've been doing a WFPB diet for about a year now, simply because I think it's healthy long-term. Honestly it hasn't made me feel any different. Sometimes while traveling or with friends I'll break my diet and eat some processed unhealthy meat meal, and it doesn't make me feel any different - I'll still workout or do something active afterwards and the ""crappy"" meal doesn't affect me at all.

I'm &lt; 10% bodyfat and super active, so I don't expect diets to make my physique better but it seems like certain foods should make you feel certain ways. I try dietary changes to see if they can offer anything good for me, but they don't seem to do anything. Does anyone else not feel the usual effects of food that everyone talks about?

Help me understand this key element of Type-2 diabetes development.,"Hi.

I’m currently reading he book “The Diabetes Code” by Jason Fung. Great book; about half way through now.
The book is generally very easy to understand, but one area I’m struggling to get is the contribution of the liver in development ld the disease. 

As I understand the development of Type 2 Diabetes: Repeated spiking of insulin due to the ingestion of excess, refined carbohydrates creates a vicious cycle. In a normal person, Insulin is secreted to bring the high blood sugar down by carrying the glucose into the body’s cells. Excess glucose is stored in the liver to be used for energy later. 
Excessive spiking of this insulin/glucose mechanism due to the persons eating habits causes insulin resistance at the cell, whereby it is full with glucose and not wanting any more. This creates a problem with excess blood glucose. The overstuffed cells are not responding to insulins mechanism, and so the body attempts to compensate by pumping out more insulin. The result, at first, is that some glucose can be forcibly placed in the cell. Eventually though, no more glucose can be physically pushed into the overcrowded cell no matter how much insulin is secreted; the result eventually being chronically high blood glucose and high insulin levels. A vicious cycle ensues where by the more insulin creates more resistance .
The next part (providing I’m correct with the above) is where I get confused. Some interaction between insulin and the liver enables the large amounts of glucose to be converted into fat via denovo lipogenisis. Eventually even this mechanism cannot save the body, and the excess fat produced by the liver accumulates there (as fatty-liver) and all over the body as subcutaneous, visceral and internal organ fat; which is what we see eventually with the pancreas when all the excess fat surrounding it starts to destroy beta cells and inhibit insulin production. The combination of fat destroying the beta cells and insulin production plus insulin resistance causes the person to become diabetic (type-2).

Could someone who knows explain the liver/insulin relationship to me? I’ve read over it several times but I just don’t understand it. The above paragraph is all I can gleam from it and I know I’m missing large chunks.

Thanks very much!",nutrition,1539796186,NT202,1,1,True,2018-10-17

"What type of ""non toxic"" cookware should I be looking at for long term?"," 

I mean. I am so confused. Everything is toxic nowadays and I don't know what to stick with.

I need a pan for cooking eggs on the stove top, something to cook/bake chicken breasts in the oven (i like oven baked chicken..), a dish for baking banana bread,

and maybe a broiling pan.

and that's basically all I need tbh. Im a single guy in an apartment trying to eat healthy.

But what to buy? The internet has just made me paranoid on the subject!

I have a brand new non stick skillet I never use because I am afraid of Teflon!

Here's a past post with the information!

Okay, so maybe I'm getting in over my head and over thinking things with this whole ""non-toxic"" cookware...

What I've gathered so far (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is the following:

1. Teflon/PTFE-coated cookware is toxic if heated too high (I think like 450?). I'm sure we've all left a pan on the stove too long. Also, it is prone to chipping, and I don't want to ingest pieces of PTFE.
2. Aluminum cookware leaches aluminum into your food. There is something called anodized aluminum, but is it safe?
3. Copper cookware leaches copper into your food.
4. Cast iron leaches iron into your food, which I suppose isn't a bad thing if you're not getting enough, but if you already are, then it could be toxic.
5. Some glass cookware could contain lead
6. Some ceramic and ceramic-coated cookware could contain lead and cadmium.
7. Stainless steel cookware contains nickel, which is an allergen for some, including me.
8. Clay cookware can contain a variety of ingredients, including aluminum. Also, unglazed clay cookware is known to leach arsenic.

Taking all of that into consideration, I have searched for good, affordable cookware, but have run into the following problems:

1. Some of the supposedly ""best"" safe cookware is incredibly expensive.
2. Ceramic cookware is not very non-stick. Also, the only brand I've found is Xtrema, which is pretty spendy.
3. Ceramic-coated cookware still seems to chip. It also supposedly doesn't stay non-stick for long.
4. Enameled cast iron seems to not be very non-stick, and the enamel doesn't seem to last long.

That's what I've discovered so far through some internet research and Amazon reviews.

Any suggestions, insight, or education would be truly appreciated. Thanks!",nutrition,1539807173,lukasthomas1234,1,1,True,2018-10-17

Food &amp; Health - A No Bullshit Guide,"#### So, what’s the secret?

1. I am going to start with the point that will excite you the most. **You can eat whatever the fuck you want.** If you like carbs, eat carbs, if you like fats, eat fats. As of this writing, the most up to date scientific conclusion is that it. Doesn’t. Matter.
2. **Weight = calories in and calories out.** Nothing more. If you got sucked into thinking that “it’s the amount of fat you eat” or “the number of carbs you eat” or anything like that. I don’t blame you one bit. It’s what has constantly been shoved down our throats every single day of our lives.
3. **It has to be personal.** The majority (over 70%) of the calories you burn every day are actually burned just to keep you alive. Therefore the amount of calories you eat and the way your body utilizes those calories is incredibly different from person to person. The way you eat has to be personalized to suit your metabolism and biological identity.
4. **You are either in a calorie surplus or a calorie deficit.** Realizing this and controlling it to suit **your specific goals in health and in life** is how you will actually get there and achieve those goals.
5. **If you want to lose weight** you need to take in fewer calories than you burn each day. **BUT DO NOT TAKE THIS TO AN EXTREME. Please.** The reason 95% of people fail trying to diet, is they think that it’s possible to drop insane amounts of weight, overnight. Sure, you can do this.. but I promise your body is going to FUCK YOU UP as soon as you start eating like a normal person again. So how do you lose weight and keep it off? First, you want to eat for 2–4 at a level where your weight doesn’t change. Then you want to **slowly** start decreasing the number of calories you eat every day while increasing the amount of physical exercise you do. **“But omg, won’t this take months??”.** Yes, it fucking will. And if fucking needs to. Shit.
6. **If you want to gain weight (muscle)** you simply need to do the opposite, you need to create a calorie surplus. As far as I am aware there isn’t any guaranteed way to put on muscle just muscle and no fat. You are going to need to experiment with what works for you and in all likelihood, you are going to put on some fat as well. The majority of the equation has to do with the type of foods you eat in a calorie surplus (generally speaking avoid low-quality fats and refined sugars) and of course, your training. If you are in a calorie surplus and want to add lean muscle, you need to signal to your body that you are optimizing for muscle and strength by exercising.
7. **If you just want to stay the same.** I am glad that you are happy with who you are. That is perfect, and I hope that everyone reading this guide will eventually fall into this category. The advice here is simple. Keep enjoying what you eat and your relationship with food. If you are currently maintaining the same weight month after month, your doing the right thing right now. Just be aware that with time, our bodies do change, so if you find yourself putting onweight you don’t want, or losing weight you don’t want to lose you might need to make small adjustments to your calorie in/ calorie out equation.
8. **The quality of the food you eat is important.** While it doesn’t matter what macro’s your diet focuses on, the quality of those macro’s does. So just try to eat as much fresh, wholesome food as possible. Try to minimize processed food as much as possible because those chemicals just ain't cool. And try to maximize the amount of fresh and wholesome food that you eat.
9. **You need to find a way of eating that works for you.** Not for 1 week or 1 month or even 1 year. But for the rest of your life. Find a way of eating that is in the calorie range that you need to achieve your goals, a way of eating that you love and a way of eating that you can stick to for the rest of your life.

When I first started my journey on optimizing my health, wellness and day to day life what I didn’t realize was how many times I would think, that I had “cracked the secret code” and end up being completely wrong.

#### Veganism and Vegetarianism

I had been sucked into the Netflix rabbit hole of food documentaries and they were definitely convincing. I appreciate the fact the Netflix is fighting for sustainable eating, there is more to our eating patterns than our health. The way we eat directly affects the world and the creatures that we share this place with. And not in a good way. But you didn’t come here to read about mass farming and agriculture, so I am not going to dive into any of that today. But I think it’s important that we, as humans, take the time to think about our actions and their effects on the world outside of our immediate selves, as frequently and in as much depth as possible.

So, let’s address the first rabbit hole I went down on my quest for optimizing health, longevity, lifestyle, and diet. Vegetarianism or, if I could handle it, Veganism.

As we all know a vegetarian is someone who does not consume meat, but they do eat animal products like eggs and milk. And a Vegan is someone who does not eat (and sometimes does not consume at all) any products derived from animals.

What sold me the most on this way of eating was two-fold:

1. It’s potential to reduce chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.
2. The general “cleanliness” of the diet. It just made sense to me at the time.

The next step was to try it out, and, I found this extremely difficult. As someone who is trying to gain lean muscle mass or at least, maintain my current bodyweight, eating enough calories was an insanely difficult task. Combining that with the complete removal of a lot of what makes food and life good, was simply too much and I could not maintain the lifestyle long term.

However, I have incorporated some of what I learned into the way I currently eat. I usually eat 1–2 vegetarian or vegan dinners, 1–2 vegetarian or vegan lunches and all of my breakfasts are vegetarian.

#### Paleo

I wanted to start by just saying fuck Paleo and sorry to like 10% of the people reading this that are now googling my name to try and find my address so they can come and kill me.

The premise that your diet is built on makes myself along with a large part of the scientific community want to pull our hair out and scream. Not only have we been living on potatoes, grains, and legumes for the past 10,000 years but you just cut out some of the highest quality food sources that we have available to us today for no fucking reason. God dammit.

&gt;*My 100% main problem with this shit is that you remove high quality foods, not based on any sort of scientific approach, but simply so it makes the diet “sounds better”.*

Now… My giant rant about Paleo is complete, and here’s the twist — I actually think the majority of food choices and their general philosophy on clean eating, is a really great foundation for health. I bet you weren’t expecting that, yeah, I think the paleo diet is healthy.

But just fucking leave out the bullshit, I know you sell more diet plans if you call it a “caveman diet”, but it comes at a direct cost to the overall health benefits you could be getting out of your eating.

#### Keto

One of the biggest dieting fads right now is Keto and in all of my research, it seems like it deserves its current fame. Even though you only heard about it recently, the origin of the keto diet can be traced back to 1921 when Russell Wilde coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood.

There are thousands and perhaps millions of people more qualified than me to talk about the Keto diet so I am going to keep this short.

The Keto diet, from my research, is best used by people wishing to maintain a calorie deficit and lose weight, not put on lean muscle in a calorie surplus. While I am not suggesting that it is not possible, there are a massive amount of highly successful lifters and athletic performers that do eat Keto, I am just saying, it’s usually more effective for a calorie deficit, and weight loss.

The premise is to eat a high fat, really high-fat diet to achieve a number of it’s proven, and not so proven, benefits: Ketones can be viewed as a superior source of energy, potentially accelerated weight loss, lower appetite, reduced insulin levels, increase HDL(the “good”) cholesterol.

The downsides? As with any eating, if you eat this way into a calorie surplus there are a host of negative side effects that come with it. This diet does generally make it harder to overeat due to the appetite suppression qualities however it certainly is possible. The other main downside is that we simply don’t know enough about the long-term effects of eating this way and we just don’t know what those could be.

#### What do you do now?

1. Define your goals. Do you want to lose weight or gain weight?
2. Take note of the current direction of your weight, is it going up, down, or staying the same?
3. Count the calories that you are eating over a 7 day period.
4. Very slowly, increase or decrease the number of calories you are eating per day in the direction of your goals
5. Make a conscious decision to try and eat less processed food and more wholesome food that you enjoy. It might take time, but your taste and body will change, that’s just how it works.

#### Conclusion

I know that this was brief and there was alot more I could cover in alot more detail, but I guess that was also the point. I hope this starts a discussion, I know that our food culture has in some was replaced religion for alot of people. Which means when I say things like, it doesn’t **matter** what diet you are on, it is going to upset alot of people.

All I hope is that this opens the floor to more open debates and discussions. We should be attacking this with an open mind, and if you are someone that defiantly defends an exact diet, I get it. I am sure that it has worked for you and that is **fantastic.** I am extremely happy that you found something that helped you hit your food and health goals.

[QUESTION] Almond milk -- does it cause digestive and bowel disturbance?,"I've decided to be bold and mature and relate a very unpleasant experience that's happened to me three times now in the last week or so, which is losing control of my bowels and having to defecate in my trousers because the force of the expulsion was so great I couldn't even get from my driveway up one flight of stairs to the toilet.

I am trying to isolate a dietary item that might be responsible. In an effort to lose weight, I stopped eating bagels and creamed cheese for breakfast, and started eating supposedly healthy high fiber breakfast cereals with almond milk. I initially was drinking cow's milk, but it  cause tremendously smelly flatulence, so I switched to almond milk. Now during the period of uncontrollable defecation, I have started the day with different breakfast cereals, so I don't think that's the culprit. That leaves almond milk.

"Consumption of ‘Longevity’ Vitamins Could Prolong Healthy Aging, Scientist Says","https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/10/412016/perspective-adequate-consumption-longevity-vitamins-could-prolong-healthy-aging

&gt; A detailed new review of nutritional science argues that most American diets are deficient in a key class of vitamins and minerals that play previously unrecognized roles in promoting longevity and in staving off chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer and, potentially, neurodegeneration.

&gt; In the review, published Oct. 15, 2018, as a “Perspective” article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Bruce Ames, PhD, presents the conclusions of more than a decade of research in his laboratory at Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), which is affiliated with UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals.

&gt; These findings are presented alongside a detailed survey of additional evidence published by other scientists. Ames concludes that healthy aging can be extended by ingesting optimal levels of 30 known vitamins and essential minerals, and he suggests that these, along with 11 additional substances not currently classified as vitamins, should be recognized as essential “longevity vitamins” because of their potential to extend a healthy life.

Eat these 5 foods to clean your lungs," 

## Consider these 5 foods that are potentially beneficial to your respiratory health.

### Citrus Fruits

It’s been shown that high vitamin C content reduces numerous health issues. Lung cancer is among these issues reduced by oranges lemons and tangerines to name a few.

Simply put the more vitamin C you consume through citrus fruits the healthier your lungs will be and the less time it will take to recover from respiratory illnesses.

### Foods High in Beta Carotene

Most people associate beta carotene with carrots and improved eye sight. Yet this pigment that gives many foods their orange color is found in a multitude of plants vegetables and fruits.

It’s transformed into vitamin A which has been shown to reduce damage to the lungs by such diseases as COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

In order to improve the health of your lungs eat a diet rich in sweet potatoes apricots red bell peppers and pumpkin.

### Green Leafy Vegetables

Moving down the list from vitamin A to vitamin B, we discover that this second vitamin group also is important for the respiratory system. That’s because it contains folate a powerful weapon in the battle against respiratory issues like bronchitis and asthma.

That’s why green leafy veggies like mustard greens collard greens spinach and kale that are high in folate are recommended for healthy lungs.

### Dark Chocolate

Yes! There is a food that’s both good for your lungs and good for those who loves sweets.

Dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate is high in antioxidants, substances that delay or prevent cell damage.

It’s that kind of oxidation that leads to many lung-related illnesses including lung cancer.

### Blueberries blackberries and cranberries

They Are also high in antioxidants and appear to be very beneficial to healthy lungs.

Does Ice Cream Contain Any Actually Nutrients? Why Do I Feel Better Days After Eating It?,"3-4 years ago I developed a ton of food intolerances after having thyroid issues.  Currently I don't eat gluten, soy, eggs, oats and I try to keep dairy fairly low (just coffee creamer and some cheese).

A few months ago I was feeling just horrible... depressed, anxious, upset stomach, etc. 

I saw a pint of Haagen Dazs on the shelf and figured ""what the heck... im not going to get much worse"".  And it made me feel better... like, a LOT better and it lasted for a few days. Since then I've tested it a few times and it always seems to help me feel better mentally... happier, calmer, less anxious.  

I'm sure there's some placebo effect, plus it's fun to eat ice cream, but the fact that I feel better for a few days after eating it makes me wonder if there's some nutritional aspect that I'm missing.

Is there a nutritional reason why ice cream could make me feel happier for 2-3 days after eating it (besides the obvious placebo)?  

The ingredients in this pint are - cream, skim milk, sugar, cocoa processed with alkali, egg yolks

**Here's the only caveat**...  I have lower back issues and when I eat too much dairy my back hurts like crazy, so eating ice cream regularly probably isn't a good idea.",nutrition,1540042017,wlmsn,2,1,True,2018-10-20

Advice for someone with ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder),"Hello. This is a very niche question and I will try and explain the situation as best as possible.


I have ARFID. When I was 30 months old, I all but stopped eating completely. This was never addressed, and as such I stopped eating most foods at two and a half years of age. I can't remember what I ate before then, so essentially the vast majority of foods I have never tried at all and have no idea how they taste/feel.


I am now 24, and female btw. I love cooking food for family and friends. I love flavours I'm familiar with. 


But when it comes to trying new foods. My body won't physically let me. 


I've tried smoothies, thinking they'd be easy to swallow with nutritional benefit. But my stomach heaves constantly before I even get to swallow it. And that's basically what always happens. My stomach expels gas and I heave, So I can't take anything down. I've been told by therapists that food has been linked to my primal fear response, So my body really does believe that food is going to kill me. 


Some foods I have tried and I can swallow but still find the process very hard. I've tried falafel for example recently, only a few small bites. But I didn't heave during. 


(I'd prefer a meat free diet.)


I also have a genetic neurodegenerative condition that affects my nerves and muscles, they are wasting away, and obviously this eating disorder isn't helping at all. Currently all I really eat is bread and basic snack foods like chocolate and such. No veg. No fruit. Ever.


Anyhoo, sorry for the essay but I figured background info would be useful. I need nutrients, and I need it at first in incredibly easy to handle ways. I love food. I want to love new food. 


The idea of sliminess puts me off. So mushrooms, fried onions etc have always been something I thought was unthinkable.

Mixing of textures I also find very difficult. 

Please. Help me love healthy food! I'm tired of staring at pictures of beautiful recipes with a growling stomach, and not being able to know how good they are. :(

How bad is my diet,"I am average in weight but I think my diet is really bad, I want to no what you think and maybe give me some pointers to sort it out! 
So for my breakfast I normally eat biscuits. I get up at 5 for work so I have no time to make anything. Sometimes I do have cereal. 

Break at work. Flavoured Porridge pots. Like syrup or cinnamon porridge you add boiling water to. 

Lunch at work. Normally sandwiches, chicken with salad and peppers in white bread, with a packet of crisps. Sometimes I might have a pie but that’s like once a month If that. Then once every 2 weeks a pot noodle. Sometimes I will just eat fruit. I think at work I don’t do bad it’s not that I really want to change this is. 

Dinner at home. A lot of different things, pasta, some kind of meat with potatoes and veg, a Microwaveable meal. Normally have one each of them sometime during my working week. It’s the snacks that’s the problem I will eat chocolate, biscuits, ice cream, crisps and sweets every night of the week before I go to bed. 

Then at the weekend more snacks, I normally get a takeaway Saturday night I would say I have 3 takeaways every month. Which I don’t think is bad. I drink water and coffee at work. At home fizzy drinks, ale and wine, but mostly in moderation apart from some weekends as you do! 

Do you think it’s just the snacks I need to cut out? I don’t think I do terrible with my meals. I normally get 3-5 of my day in. To be honest I am happy with that I’d rather get 3 of my 5 a day over none at all. How can my nutrition get better?

Do you need probiotics in your diet?,"Probiotics have become one of those fancy health-food terms used applied to many products on the market. While advertiser may hype probiotics as something you “need” in your food, there is a time and place for probiotics. So before you spend extra money pumping up your daily meals with excess probiotics, it is important to know if you actually need them. To understand the benefit of probiotics and assess your need for them, it is important to first understand how your intestinal lining operates.

Each of our intestines house trillions of microorganisms from many different species. There are bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses. (Don’t freak out! This is normal and essential to smooth digestive function) The term for these organisms is microbiota and each microbiota live in union with your digestive tract. They get fuel to live from the foods you eat while also helping to break down the food your stomach may have been unable to digest completely. In addition to breaking down our undigested food, microbiota are responsible for managing potentially toxic food compounds as well as creating certain vitamins and protein components that are vital to our bodies. 

What does this have to do with probiotics? Well, probiotics are simply a fancy word for foods that contain the bacteria our microbiota need in order to thrive. They are essential to the proper digestion of food and arrangement of your microbiome.

If you are a healthy adult who eats fruits and vegetables, you likely already have all of the probiotics you need in your microbiome. Keep feeding them fruits and vegetables and they will keep working for you. That being said Sometimes it is necessary for us to destroy bacteria. A common example of this is when you need to take an antibiotic. Antibiotics do their job killing a bacterium in your body that may be causing harm. Unfortunately, they also kill the good bacteria with it. This would be a great time to start consuming some probiotics. You can get this from yogurt, keifer, sauerkraut and many more common grocery staples. Another time it can be important to consume probiotics is as a child or senior. It is at these age ranges that our microbiomes are not as strong and need assistance. 


Okay, so your standing in the yogurt aisle at your local grocery store and you grab a “probiotic” yogurt that contains something like L. casei bacteria and you likely think to yourself, “This must be a good source of probiotics. It says probiotics right on the container”. Well, the first thing you should know is that ALL yogurt products contain probiotics. They all contain live bacteria that play a role in the health of your microbiome. This particular yogurt your holding may have “added” bacteria, but do you really need added bacteria? Probably not.


The moral of the story here is that probiotics are absolutely essential to rebalancing a distraught microbiome. However, if you are a young or middle-aged adult who generally consumes a balanced diet that contains a variety of fruits, vegetables and fiber sources, there is no reason to put extra emphasis on probiotic consumption.

The Importance of Vitamins in Your Diet,"Vitamins are a tricky part of the diet. Many don't really understand why we need them (if we even do) and then there are questions of which ones and how much and where can I get them? For a long time nobody really knew what vitamins did and it wasn't even until the 1920's that they were even called by the name ""vitamin"". By now a lot more research has emerged about what vitamins are and what they do for us. Generally speaking, most people consider vitamins to be a good thing even if they aren't really sure why. Whether you actively seek out foods that contain vitamins or make sure to take a multivitamin pill, is it really something you need to do?

&amp;#x200B;

The basic answer to this question is yes. However nobody really knows how much of each vitamin you really need. The only judge of this is if you have a deficiency of a certain vitamin that may cause adverse side effects. But while you do need vitamins, you don't need to be taking a multivitamin. That is a common misconception. Vitamins can be artificially produced, which is why many take multivitamins, but they are not necessary. As long as you maintain a healthy balanced diet, you shouldn't have to worry about a lack of the right vitamins. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with this thinking is that many people are lacking a healthy AND balanced diet. With a large prevalence of processed food, more and more people are missing out on essential vitamins. During the processing of food, vitamins get destroyed so the initial ingredients which may have contained vitamins, now how been stripped of them. Some companies attempt to add these vitamins back into their foods chemically and as a way to sell the food as ""healthy"", but that has led to a whole other issue of problems. Another dietary restriction of vitamins is not necessarily the lack of a healthy diet, but instead of a balanced diet. For someone who follows a vegan or vegetarian diet, they might have a harder time getting all the vitamins they need with the limited food choices they have, so taking supplements is actually very important.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, the main take away is that vitamins are important to your diet. Whether you are getting enough from your diet, or need a multivitamin to supplement you, they are essential to many body functions and shouldn't be ignored anymore.

Im using MyProtein now but i wanna buy more and i found out about BulkPowder... They say on their webpage that they WheyProtein is from Grass Fed EUROPEAN cows...

There are info on net that MyProtein (as majority of other protein vendors) source their protein Powder from China...

I adapted a bodybuilders diet to a general health diet. Thoughts?,"PREQUISIT to attaining diet (skip ahead if not interested)

I've made it a goal to be more healthy overall. My and my brother were working out but in our back yard for a week or two, but stopped because we ran out of protein shake, broke routine after break day, and didn't know enough about a balanced workout to make a habit of it, and it's now getting cold outside. My cousin's step-brother is an award winning professional bodybuilder and gave my cousin his diet he took about 5 weeks before the competition. It's designed to make this lose weight and gain muscle. He stuck to this diet with one cheat day a week and the results were very good. Me and my brother decided to give it a shot as well.

ORIGINAL DIET

2 scoops of protein shake in the morning and at night
6-8oz chicken or turkey 3 times a day
6-8 ounces sweet potato OR 3/4 cups brown rice
As many greens as you want, preferably broccoli
One cheat day a week

I've been trying to recommend this diet to more people, but I almost feel like it's too specific for most people to adapt to, as well as lacking in sugar and some fats, so I've made the following adaptation:

ADAPTED DIET
No protein shakes
6-8oz *any meat, *or healthy protein source, *fat included
6-8oz sweet potato or 3/4 cup *any rice
As many greens as you want
*Greek yogurt and fruit as snacks
*You can snack on any ""junk"" you want but try to make it amount to less than 10% of your calorie intake

Protein classification ideas,"Lipids are classified by Saturated, polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and trans fat, and Carbohydrates are classified by sugar, added sugar, sugar alcohol, soluble and insoluble fiber

There could be two subcategories of Protein; Essential amino acids or complete protein. Essential amino acids would be calculated by adding all 9 essential amino acids together, while complete protein would be calculated by finding the least abundant essential amino acid and multiplying by 9.


Examples:


1 BK Double Whopper with cheese (399 g)

___________________________

**Protein**			58g

  Essential Amino Acids	20g

  Complete Protein	 	  4g
___________________________

The least abundant amino acid was Tryptophan at 399mg, multiplied 339 by 9 and got roughly 3.6g, or 4g of complete protein


1 BK cheeseburger (133 g)

___________________________________

**Protein**			   	   20g

  Essential Amino Acids	     	     7g

  Complete Protein	      Less than 1g

As part of my own professional and knowledge advancement, I have attended Eating Disorder education classes to expose myself to different issues regarding health and nutrition. In this case, however, they’ve used Set Point Theory to say that your body has a genetic “normal” that it will always try to maintain this normal.

I have a strong digestive system, no adverse effects yet(been doing the beans thing for a month).Lots a carbs, very little fat in these mung beans. 

However, i stray way from a lot of meat. The bulk of my protein requirements come from two main sources :

1 ) protein shakes ( 50 g, 2 scoops)

2) Within that protein shake is 500 grams of raw ( when cooked is about 1.25kg, has about 120 - 130 grams of protein )of MUNG beans. Yes it might sound disgusting but you can't even tatse it. This saves me a shit ton of time daily. This classifies as regular food right?

Apart from this, i eat regular food aswell( pretty much whatever is cooked at home which gives me more nutrition(apprx. 50 g of protein)).

What do you think about humans drinking cow milk?,"A while ago I found myself questioning whether or not cow milk is actually “healthy” for humans. 
I’ve read a good amount about colostrum and despite what some say, I personally think we can benefit from it as long as it can be absorbed. But there’s practically no colostrum content in milk as colostrum is only present within the first 72 hours of birth if I’m not mistaken. So what’s in regular milk? That I’m not quite sure. &amp; im sure we’ve all read the disturbing things online fueld by videos of deranged dairy farms. Blood, puss, I mean they do bleach the milk so it wouldn’t be impossible to hide... But aside from all of that , what we know for sure is that just like us, or any other mammal , cows have hormones of course(aside from the ones they get pumped with)
That brings me to this - in most cases , the cows are treated like crab , some have infections, and on top of it they’re pumped with hormones and antibiotics... If they’re free range and happy , I believe it can be healthy. But these animals that are bred in coupes shoulder to shoulder are loaded with cortisol. And research has shown that eating meat from animals with high levels of cortisol can carry over and influence our hormones directly. If you don’t know it already cortisol is a stress hormone and it can cause a cascade of problems. I’m not “bashing” milk , but I certainly have a negative bias on it.

"Effect of LCHF [keto] diet on LDL cholesterol and gene expression in normal-weight, young adults: A randomized controlled study [Retterstol et al., 2018]","[Sci-Hub link to full paper](http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915018314321)

&gt;Background and aims

&gt;The effects of a low carbohydrate/high fat (LCHF) diet on health are debated. This study aim to explore the effects of a diet with less than 20 g carbohydrates per day (LCHF) on plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in young and healthy adults. Secondary aim was the assessment of lipid profile and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene expression.

&gt;Methods

&gt;This was a randomized controlled parallel-designed intervention study. Participants were either assigned to a three-week LCHF diet or a control group continuing habitual diet ad libitum, in both groups.

&gt;Results

&gt;In total, 30 healthy normal weight participants completed the study. Nine subjects did not complete it due to adverse events or withdrawn consent. In the LCHF diet group (n = 15), plasma LDL-C increased from (mean ± SD) 2.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l before intervention to 3.1 ± 0.8 after, while in the control group (n = 15), LDL-C remained unchanged: 2.5 ± 0.8 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.001 between groups). There was a significant increase in apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids, uric acid and urea in the LCHF group versus controls. Plasma levels of triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), glucose, C-peptide or C-reactive protein (CRP), blood pressure, body weight or body composition did not differ between the groups. PBMC gene expression of sterol regulator element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) was increased in the LCHF group versus controls (p ≤ 0.01). The individual increase in LDL-C from baseline varied between 5 and 107% in the LCHF group.

&gt;Conclusions

&gt;An LCHF diet for three weeks increased LDL-C with 44% versus controls. The individual response on LCHF varied profoundly.

And before anyone exclaims 'LDL-C is not a good predictor of CVD risk!' keep in mind they also measured ApoB and that value increased significantly as well.  In fact, in 6 out of the 15 subjects, ApoB increased by more than 60%.

My TL;DR takeaway from this is that the keto diet is CVD-risky for a significant portion of the population and that if you decide to go on the keto diet long-term then please get your LDL-P or ApoB measured every so often to make sure you aren't increasing your risk for CVD.",nutrition,1540403695,dreiter,27,1,True,2018-10-24

I've been wondering why I'm so lethargic lately and realized it's probably lack of food, but it's so freaking hard to eat. I'm in grad school so out most of the day. We aren't allowed to eat in the lab (sometimes I do with a protein bar though). When it's lunch break, I'm rarely hungry. When I feel hunger, I'm busy during class.

I'm trying pre-made frozen meals/leftovers, finger foods like cheese/hummus and crackers, big protein shakes in the morning, and try to focus on getting in proteins because the other macros come easier. Food just doesn't taste that appealing anymore and it's SO hard to get myself to prepare food when I'm not feeling hungry.

The shakiness and dizziness kicks in so suddenly after I forget to eat for a while and I think my lack of energy and dip in mood lately is partially due to lack of nutrition. I've noticed lately I've been so focused on class and assignments that I forget to track my intake or eat in general. I need to fix this pronto.

The Longevity Diet and Nutritional Gray Areas,"Newb here.  
My main question is the last one, #4, esp. for those who've read the Longevity Diet.  
Just did a two-hour internet binge on longevity. I’ll start reading LD today, but want to at least get started with some groceries today until I understand more. I’m not wealthy so can’t afford anything too fancy.

Conclusions from my research binge (lmk if anything’s drastically off)

1. When: Twice/day + snack (low calorie/sugar). Small time windows. Bigger meal first, last meal 3-4 hours before bed. Do a FMD 4x/year
2. What: plants and fish
   1. 0.36 grams protein per pound. 30 grams of which consumed in a single meal to maximize muscle synthesis
   2. Every 3 days: multivitamin
   3. What not: sugar, white flour, processed foods, most meat
3. How much? (Question 3 below)

QUESTIONS

1. GRAY AREAS: Fruit, fish, sheep/goat dairy, eggs, dark chocolate, alcohol/wine, ketogenic diet  
\-I see different opinions on all these. What are yours (in a nutsheel, if possible)  
\-I like fruit, but not married to it. Can/should it be cut out because its sugary?  
\-I see a lot of no/low meat, but Longo says fish3x/week. Is this actually *advised*, or merely allowed (“it’s okay to eat a bit of fish if you *must*”)
2. Every three days: just any old multivitamin? Also read somewhere: multivitamin, mineral pill, AND fish oil pill. So should I shop for three kinds of pills?
3. What is the peak minimum of food quantity before it’s bad for you? Is intermittent fasting just as good as caloric restriction, or is it merely a “kinda okay alternative” to eating close to nothing, for those unwilling to go to extremes. I’m willing either way.
4. If you HAD to advise the exact same two meals everyday, what would they be? Bonus if it uses under 12 groceries.  
\-I love simplification and constancy, been eating the same exact three meals for the last six months. That said, if there’s no way to make this healthy, lmk and then your opinion on the lowest variety that works.",nutrition,1540406901,jackchak,2,1,True,2018-10-24

- about an hour or so later I usually have two hard boiled eggs with an avocado. 
-another 3 hours later I have either a salad with chicken or yoghurt with granola.

Thoughts on Keto or other diet changes to spur weight loss? Newbie here...,"Hi everyone!

I had a visit with my doctor and she said I’m just starting to enter into the ‘overweight’ category. All in all I’m very healthy, no current medical issues or concerns, but I would like to lean out a bit. As I work out several times a week, I know my diet is the culprit.  I’ve got a bit of fluff. My doctor did suggest keto, or altogether cutting carbs and focusing more on protein and vegetables. As I’m new to all this keto information, I was wondering how strictly I’d need to adhere to the diet to see changes? I can definitely cut out a lot of carbs, but if I had some occasionally would that ruin all progress?

2) I know that it's calorie free, and I have never really paid attention to calories, however as far as converting over to body fat in a way that regular sugar does, how similar is it? 

3) I suppose I would classify my diet as paleo, mostly chicken, eggs and fish with a lot of veggies and nuts and an occassional protein shake. That being said, does stevia negate my progress? Similar to question #2, would this be converted into carbs?

Guide to Vitamin B12,"**Guide to Vitamin B12**

**General Info:** Vitamin B12 is also known as cobalamin. It has a large cobalt atom at the center. Vitamin B12 is an interesting case because it's the only essential nutrient that is synthesized by microbes (bacteria and archaea in this case). Animals bioaccumulate B12 in their tissues, which is why B12 is scarce on a vegan diet. The liver stores most of your B12 and replenishes your bloodstream with it. We used to get the majority of our B12 from untreated water, but nowadays we clean our water to get rid of bacteria. However, there are vegan foods that contain it (nori, shiitake mushrooms, etc.) just not in quantities large enough to be a sufficient source, which is why supplementation is . However, vegans aren't the only ones to have B12 deficiencies; around 40% of people have low serum B12 levels (under \~250 pmol/L). The cutoff for deficiency in the US is typically around 250 pmol/L, but some countries such as Japan have cutoffs at 500 pmol/L. I recommend getting your levels over 500 pmol/L, and I would consider anything under 350 pmol/L deficient. B12 deficiency rates in the elderly are even higher because of reduced absorption as we age. 

B12 deficiency can cause many neurological symptoms (headaches, neuropathy, increased risk of dementia, and hollowing of the spinal cord) and also pernicious anemia.

B12 is also important for heart health, nervous system health, immune health, and healthy blood cells.

**Dietary Sources:** Significant sources of B12 include liver, bivalves, and some fish. Farm animals are almost almost given B12 supplements since they don't get enough from their diets, so they are a poorer source of B12.

**Supplementation:** Some are concerned about the cyanide in cyanocobalamin (which is the most common, the cheapest, and the most stable form of B12 found in oral supplements). However, there is nothing to worry about unless you have kidney issues. The human body is well equipped to deal with cyanide, as it is commonly found in natural foods. Flaxseeds contain hundreds of times more cyanide than cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is broken down by our bodies into hydroxocobalamin, which is then turned into the active coenzymes methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Some argue that methylcobalamin is better than cyanocobalamin. This is only true if you supplement both methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, as methyl can't be converted into adenosyl, which is the mitochondrial form of B12. I don't recommend taking methyl without adenosyl. Cyanocobalamin is in my opinion the best choice due to cost and dose consistency.

I recommend these groups take B12 supplements: vegans, vegetarians, people over 50, people with gastrointestinal nutrient absorption problems, people with anemia, and people who don't eat high B12 animal products daily. So essentially most people should take a B12 supplement. 

Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin, so there is little risk of overdose. 250 mcg daily doses of cyanocobalamin seem adequate for maintaining B12 levels, and up to 1000 mcg a day is fine as well. 2500-5000 mcg weekly doses of cyanocobalamin may also work. If you choose to take methyl/adenosyl I recommend 1000 mcg daily. 

There was a small association found between B12 supplementation and lung cancer in smokers, but it only raises your risk by like 1/1,000,000.

Additionally, both B12 supplements and topical B12 have shown promise for canker sore treatment.

Effects of eating moldy coconut,"Hello there.
  
I've recently been eating some moldy coconut and after my colleagues were alarmed about the health risks of that. First of all: it was not mushy and the smell was a little off but still within bounds.

I took two small sips of the water and when I felt it was racing I threw the rest away.

Diet advice-does this sound like something that can be successful.,"So last night i got home from work late and was starving. I ordered a big chicken parm dinner that came with pasta and bread and decided to order 6 wings too from a local pizzeria. I stopped at Walgreens on my way home and was checking out and bought a bag of Reese’s. I ate almost all of it last night.

My point is that when I wait to make decisions when i am hungry i make bad ones. This AM i decided I needed to be more structured. I am a pretty big guy and moderately active. All in i burn probably 2900 to 3300 calories a day but need to lose about 50lbs, my cholesterol is also a bit high and i would like to nip this in the bud.

My plan is to eat the same thing for breakfast and dinner everyday and eat whatever i want for lunch.

I am thinking about eating a bunch of egg whites, spinach, maybe tomato/onion, half an avocado, salt for breakfast. 

A lunch that is around 1k calories of whatever i want.

Then  for dinner 300 calories of a whole grain, oatmeal, barley, etc and 300 calories of fruit and or vegetables(including sweet potato). I will cook this with no fat as the point is to eat it because i am hungry and not because it taste too good.

After a month i will adjust the diet/maybe allow a bit more wiggle room on either Saturday or Sunday.

Any suggestions or modifications you would make to this plan? Any pitfalls? Do you think this is a good/bad idea and why?

"Which is worse, saturated fat or cholesterol?","Any idea how cholesterol in food compares with saturated fat? For an example, most red meat is supposed to be bad for you due to high levels of saturated fat. Seafood is often cited as good. So taking a random option from each...

Filet mignon, 100g, has 9.7g of saturated fat and 85mg of cholesterol.

Shrimp, 100g, has .3g saturated fat and 195mg cholesterol.

How does water and salt triple the nutritional values?  That can't be right. Should I be reducing the cooked values to 1/3 because the beans become bigger?  That kinda makes more sense to me.   So I would have to pack for lunch 114 grams of cooked beans to get 70 g of calories and 9 g of protein.

How to drop Optavia and shop/cook groceries smartly?,"Yes, I buy Optavia, don't throw things at me.  I'm not drinking the Kool Aid and I have no interest in spreading the word.

At a time when I was frustrated with my body fat percentage despite great gains in my fitness levels, I decided to see what meal program my Facebook friend was rambling about.  She sold me on Optavia.  I was apprehensive because I normally get with my physician and a personal trainer to discuss fitness goals, so I was breaking my own rules.  I bought it because multiple small meals a day was something my dad bugged me to do for about twenty years.  And I *was* happy with the results.  I lost weight, and a recent Bod Pod scan confirmed it *was* body fat.  My run time also improved (but that may have been more of her HITT suggestions.)

During the week I go through five program meals and one large lean n' green in the evening.  Food on the weekdays is just a utility to me so I don't mind when its boring.  Its nice having a convenient set of small meals with good macros planned out.  But this stuff is expensive.  I'm ultimately dodging my responcibility to buy and cook groceries smartly.

Before Optavia, my shopping list was simultanously healthy and lazy.  Multigrain bread, brown rice, eggs, plain nonfat yogurt, berries, maybe bananas, chicken thighs or chicken quarters, and bags and bags of frozen veggies (usually california blend.)  On special occasions I cook a mean paella or lasagna.  But the big picture was two things: I'd rather have an empty refridgerator than spoiled food, and I didn't mind eating the same boring dinner of chicken + veggies and brown rice if it meant less time cooking/shopping.

I wouldn't mind going back to that, but how do I do so while maintaining the body fat loss I have achieved so far?  How does one take all these raw groceries and make multiple small meals of them throughout the day (if that's even a good idea).

So, let's say I want to **limit** my exposure to grains, a good diet, in a nutshell, would consist of:

* lean animal protein sources like meat/fish: chicken breast, lean beef, lean pork, fish, shellfish, egg whites....
* vegetables (no-grain) which most often have very little calories / very little carbs; and some fruits
* healthy fats: let's say avocados, nuts (in moderations) and olive oil.

I am pretty sure that most people would agree that I can't get the vast majority of calories from animal sources of protein; and the veggies and fruits won't have a significant impact either.

So, should I get a good portion from fats/nuts?  Is that what the true Mediterranean Diet used to be before the Industrial Revolution only 100 or so years ago? Or pre-agriculture diet?

Then when I arrive from college I eat 2 of the same sandwiches that I have for breakfast, with a coup of tea or juice, and then I do not eat anything else until the next day, but at night I'm really starving.

I barely eat vegetables or fruits (not because I dont like them, but because I'm lazy to prepare salads or I forget to buy fruits when I go to the supermarket) 

Thing is, I dont really like to cook, I find it a waste of time, being on the kitchen while I could be somewhere else doing stuff. 

I'm allergic to seafood, I cant eat non-organic chicken (I'm allergic to the hormones they put in chickens to make them grow in weeks), and I'm a lil bit lactose intolerant, and I was born with reflux. 


I really wanna start going to the gym and have a diet, a good diet, to gain some muscular mass, since I'm too thin, but the thought of cooking every single day is exhausting.

Is milk a good option to prevent bone loss?,"Hello there,

Future family doctor here, nowadays learning my way through rheumatology, which, besides many other diseases, takes care of Osteoporosis. 

For those of you not acquainted with the term, Osteoporosis happens when the bone loses density, hence becoming more fragile. Diets low in Calcium have been linked to an increase in osteoporosis, as well as not enough exercise, early menopause... I don't want to ramble on :).

During our interviews, we question people on their calcium intake, asking mainly for Milk, cheese and yogurt, alas, all of them dairy products. (not sure if my use of alas is correct here, but I always wanted to use the word)

My question is the following:

Is milk really a good option to prevent bone loss? Is it an easy calcium to absorb or could you also resort to nuts, leafy greens...etc? Is it true that dairy products increase the acidity in the body and you end up losing more calcium? 

I asked the people I work with, all of them fancy doctors, and they don't seem to know &amp; they just follow the dairy flow without questioning. 

If someone could link me any studies, I'd love to be able to recommend to my patients more options than just milk or cheese.

""Is it possible to hinder inflammation recovery by overeating anti-inflammatory foods? ""
submitted 4 hours ago by HarrisonCO1
_______________________________________________




* NO REFINED SUGAR. the thing you want to eat is a negative:  including any PROCESSED carbs that easily convert into sugar. That's #1 response, invariably. also cut your red-meat consumption, andgo to fish, or chicken for a bit. indirectly, dairy, eg. lactic acid build up can cause blockages, and slow down your lymphatic system. 

* EAT MORE LEAFY GREEN VEGGIES. I am huge into super greens, also spirulina and chlorophyll, which also help detoxify.

* There are also whole traditions that specifically address non-inflammatory foods, such as  Ayurveda and Chinese medicine, and I would start within those regimens as more reliable  than your average search. also Tumeric (Fresh) is a massive staple in ayuveda for such things...

* Any foods with high potassium, magnesium, and vitamin C are good.


* as my token outlier response, beyond not sugar, is just... not eating. intermittent fasting is exceptional for removing the underlying processes that cause inflammation. I am a huuuge IF guy, as a competitive athlete who has seen accross the board results, I can tell you that sustained energy and recovery are 2 of the most suprising results. 

* If youre serious, and cant get results, SEE AN ALLERGIST. SEE AN ALLERGIST, and do a skin panel NOT a blood panel. they're typically covered, if not, it's about 400$ x2. what happened with me, is there are soooo many diets out there saying EAT THIS! EAT THAT! and you can run straight into hard core allergies, then double down on them. for me it was Avocado and various nuts, and I was having intense reactions, including inflammation, and symptoms that dont appear to be allergic.

*ps- if anyone reading this has direct experience with DRY FASTING, and have effectively used it to cut their inflammation, I'd like to hear: or if you have links, lmk. that is an alleged benefit, and I'm curious if science/concensus supports claims

What is the current consensus (if any) on dietary cholesterol? Does high dietary cholesterol consumption (e.g. keto) = high blood cholesterol levels?,"I've read a few posts on several keto-focused subs which claim that a keto diet, which is typically high in animal products (meat, eggs, dairy), will not lead to elevated cholesterol as dietary cholesterol does not relate to blood cholesterol levels.

To me, this sounds very dubious - I know our bodies can create cholesterol without food, but why would someone who eats a WFPB diet (whole food plant based diet) for instance have very high cholesterol if they were a normal/healthy weight?

Surely what we eat directly affects our blood composition? If I completed eliminated or consumed to excess a certain vitamin for example, I would expect to see either a deficiency or elevated levels in my blood after a period of time. So why would this not apply to cholesterol?

* Is there any current 'consensus' on how dietary cholesterol affects blood cholesterol levels? 

* Why do some who follow a ketogenic diet for a considerable period fo time (e.g. 1+ years) sometimes report low/acceptable cholesterol levels despite eating high amounts of cholesterol from meat/cheese/cream/eggs?

"Trying to eat healthier. I came up with this dish as a good way to eat potatoes, tomatoes, and avocados. Is this ok?","https://imgur.com/a/lT5Vznl


It starts off with a small / large golden potato with skin in the sous vide for an hour or more. 

While that's happening I prepare the tomato by pealing the skin and cutting in half.

When the potato is done I squash it. Then I put it in the pan with olive oil on low heat to brown the bottom. I season with a little salt, pepper, thyme, rosemarry, and whatever herbs.


In goes the 2 tomato halves, olive oil on top of the potato and tomato and I stick it in the broiler (oven) to brown the top and roast the tomato.

When it reaches the desired color I take it out of the broiler. I place the potato in a bowl along with the tomato halves. I add the avocado, some pistachio bits for texture, a teaspoon of sour cream, chives, and olive oil to finish. And small basil leaves to garnish over the sour cream.

Here's what I'm worried about:

The olive oil in the pan when browning the potato and roasting the tomato. I know heating oil takes the healthy properties out of it, but I make sure it never goes above it's smoke point.

And the sour cream. I can do with out it tbh.

Meal replacements for busy guy.,"I am super pushed for time- have been for years so it's hard to get regular meals in.

One way I get my nutrients is by blending up raw vegetables and throwing it down twice a day- usually 2 litres of cabbage, carrots, celery plus some fruits to sweeten up the deal. I get some kind of quick noodle/ chicken and rice on top of that during the day and then have a very good dinner- so it works. I'm also happy to chuck down a few supplements to polish things up- mainly zinc, vit C, general minerals.

With starting up more in the way of weight training and rowing over the last 6 months, I have found I need to get more food in. It's been hard to make the time. I started with adding raw eggs to the blend, which worked fairly well. Not enough carbs and protein it seems though so I've started adding whey poweder into the mix instead.

I also read on Google you typically don't want high portions of nuts and that it's better to dehydrate them first.

What things matter for body composition?,"Hey everyone! I know the big things for minimizing body fat and building muscle are proper calorie intake, proper protein intake, and minimizing sugar, as well as minimizing inflammation in general. I was wondering how much the following matters, if at all:

- Low glycemic load foods (is whole wheat pasta okay?)
- carbohydrate vs fat intake
- inflammatory oils (and which oils are inflammatory, although last time I asked about oil I caused absolute chaos and there seem to be conflicting studies for all of them except extra virgin olive oil...)
- soybean oil
- carbs versus fat (glycogen for muscles? Being in a state that preferentially stores fat? Apparently fat is directly stored as body fat first and then burned?)
- eating carbohydrate and fat in combination
- saturated fat vs polyunsaturated fat? Apparently anecdotally, some people in bodybuilding circles claim better aesthetics eating more unsaturated fats, some vice versa.

I’m just trying to figure out what actually matters. I already don’t eat any added sugar and I eat enough protein, but I’m currently in college and man it is hard to eat as clean as I would like. It’s hard just avoiding added sugar because it’s in all the sauces and stuff, and there’s soybean oil in everything. Even the rice is cooked with canola oil, which I can’t avoid anyway because all the chicken breast is cooked in it too... I’m having difficulty hitting my calorie goals eating just oatmeal, vegetables, and (canola oil) grilled chicken breast.

how common is damage to the metabolism through dieting/eating disorders?,"so, i’ll try to make this short. 

i’m basically a disabled 19 y/o. i have very low blood pressure as well, and it’s all a mess at times. 

i was eating roughly 1200 cals a day for a while when i was able-bodied and weight lifting and only getting 50-80g of carbs a day. I now know this was horrendous for my body and my personal needs, but i was seeing results and stuck with it. I’m 5’4 so i don’t need terribly much food, especially since i barely get to 3,000 steps a day and only do light yoga as exercise at the moment. but it still felt excessive and was disordered. 

after talking with an ED dietician i learned about how damaged my metabolism could’ve become since id basically been doing 1200cals for years. ive slowly upped my intake and i genuinely have a greater relationship with food now. i follow a lot of nutritionists and work with my doctors and i feel truly healthy. despite my lack of exercise due to my failing body. 

my hinger has surged lole crazy. i eat a lot (a lot to me, that is) even though i barley move. i get 1600-1700cals a day now. 

it made me wonder a few things-
could this be eating disorder related and my body is just making up for the lost years of the lack of nutritious food and me neglecting it? or could this be related to my metabolism in any way and it’s damaged for the same reasons?

Questions about Electrolytes/minerals (Magnesium in particular),"Is it true that potassium will not be absorbed with a magnesium deficiency present? 

I have seen to correct a magnesium deficiency is tricky because only 1% of magnesium resides in the blood the rest is in organs, bones and our muscles and that you can do it orally with megadoses of 500-800mg daily four times a day but other sources say going over 350mg or 400mg RDA in men can cause side effects and possibly overdose 

Also I have seen processed carbs, Alcohol and fizzy drinks along with coffee and tea can flush magnesium from the body or prevent absorption.

Question about minerals and PPIs+low carb diets,"*Story

I'm a 19 year old male was previously on a vegan diet albeit beige one with some fruits and vegetables I was put on a PPI for 6 months due to an ulcer near the end of the six weeks I started devolping cramps in my calves and pain in my joints a low carb diet in around 2 weeks into this and the symptoms got worse I ended up in hospital I went to an emergency clinic because of extreme muscle cramps and tingling I had the hospital discharged me after an X-ray and blood test and told me to go to my GP.

My GP ordered some tests and said It sounds fine and was highly unlikely the PPIs they can only cause deficiency after a long long time I thought it was B12 at the time. On a return visit he told me the bloods where clear and it's probably all in my head or stress but he would send me to the hospital and the hospital said I seem perfect and sent me home but my muscles where visibly spasming   . On a return visit to the GP office but to a different Doctor she said it doesn't sound  good and she wants me to see the neurologist so I was up in front of the neurologist they did a psyhcial check and said it looks good only some hyperreflex in the leg, They did a CT which was clear and also called me back for an MRI which was clear the neurologist also said the PPI was unlikely to cause deficiency. 

*Questions

Can PPis cause deficiency? and also how does a low carb diet come in here I maintained it during all this for 6 months and only recently gave it up im a bit better but my muscles will ache and buzz after a hard workout. They visibly twitch every now and again and I have a tingling in my fingers and toes I did some research online which pointed to electrolytes and then it clocked PPIs block electrolyte absorption and low carb diets are naturally low In these I never supplemented and I took in copius amounts of Coffee whilst maintaining my exercise would have done something.

Prove to me that a diet with moderate carbs and fats does NOT eventually cause atherosclerosis/CVD.,"I know, the title could do with some work.

Firstly, I just wanted to state I am neither anti-fat nor anti-carb.

Anyway. 

* Pretty much all studies of the longest living populations in the world have concluded that the macro ratios of their diets were high carb with very little fat (as low as 5% fat in some instances).

* Consuming a diet that has moderate or high amounts of both carbs and fats results in higher amounts of AGE (Advanced Glycation End-Products) formed within the body which are associated with inflammatory disease and ageing. AGEs are formed when fats and sugars interact within the blood. Therefore, if we consume very little fat OR carbs, the risk is lowered significantly.

* One of the biggest causes of inflammation in the body is a high/disproportionate intake of Omega-6 PUFAs compared to Omega-3 PUFAs. These are obviously fats, and therefore a low intake of fat overall means a low intake of inflammatory Omega-6 PUFAs.

* The 'Standard American Diet' which is notoriously moderate/high in both carbs and fats, is widely seen as associated with atherosclerosis/CVD.

------------------------------------------------------------

With all of the above in mind, can you or anyone prove to me that a diet which is moderate/high in both carbs and fats (**even ""healthy"" fats and complex carbs**) does NOT cause eventually contribute to atherosclerosis/CVD?

People on here and elsewhere (including most nation's health boards) advise eating a ""balanced"" diet of both complex carbs (e.g. wholegrains, fruit, vegetables) and ""healthy"" fats (e.g. MUFAs and PUFAs), which means a diet with moderate intakes of both carbs and fats - they claim it is ""better"" than the Standard American Diet because the carbs and less refined or completely unrefined, foods are whole and the fats are healthy and don't contain industrial oils or trans fats.


But what if that wasn't the issue? All the evidence IMO suggests that it's not necessarily the quality of the carb/fat source, but the actual macro ratio of our diets - i.e. moderate or high intakes of both carbs and fats are inflammatory in themselves when consumed together.


-----------------------------------------

**TL;DR** Prove to me that a moderate/high carb and fat intake does NOT contribute to CVD.

"Is it normal to feel nauseous when starting a new diet, or is that a sign that I'm doing something wrong?","So, right now I'm focused purely on cutting costs to finish paying off debt. Frankly, I'm stressed out enough that I'm just not bringing a new diet into that equation just yet. However, in one month I should be completely debt-free, and I'd like to be ready to jump right into a healthier diet.

Something I've noticed in the past is that, when trying a radical change, I usually wind up feeling very nauseous, which has definitely proven a barrier for me (not *always*, but definitely most of the time).

I'm curious; is that my body just rebelling against anything that isn't the usual garage I'm eating? Or is that a sign that I'm genuinely approaching a diet the wrong way?

For the record, I have a difficult time with ""gradual change"". For example, when I started working out this year, I had to force myself to go every single day for an hour; if I give myself any sort of leniency, I know myself well enough to know that I'll just abuse it and use any excuse to get out of doing it (ie. ""Ah, I'm just not feeling it today, I'll go *tomorow*"", etc).

But, you know, I had tremendous success with keto a few years ago, but I also wasn't working full-time either, plus I had my dad to lean on for helping cook (he did it with me; in all honesty, looking back, it was actually sort of fun both of us experimenting with new ""keto recipes""). I worry if I'm capable of sticking with it now, or if I need to look into something else.

Just ""cutting calories"" has never been a good fit for me, though. Probably because I have the freedom to still eat garbage, but so little of it that I still feel hungry all the time. So I may need some guidance in that department.

Anyways, I'm just rambling at this point.

TL;DR

I often feel nauseous when beginning any sort of diet. Is that ""normal"" for people changing from an extremely poor diet, or is it more likely that I'm just eating the wrong kinds of foods on whatever ""new"" diet I'm moving towards?",nutrition,1537193627,Jcorb,3,1,True,2018-09-17

I've been vegetarian/vegan for four months. I never supplemented Vitamin B12 during that time.

It doesn't feel like the brain fog I feel if I eat a bunch of bread in the morning. This is different; it feels like my brain isn't firing properly, like there is less brain. My brain feels like it's slowly stopping and it's terrifying.

I did my research and bought B12 supplements. I took 10000mg Cyanocobalamin yesterday and today, and haven't noticed much improvement, and the fog seems to be getting worse (could be enhanced by my worrying).

I ordered sublingual Methylcobalamin B12 and it comes tomorrow, and I'll start taking it. My question:

&amp;#x200B;

Could I have something like MS? I read B12 deficiency can take three years, but it's only been four months. I do not want MS but my brain seriously feels like it's broken, as if it's not working how it should be.

5 Signs You Are Not Eating Enough,"
5 SIGNS YOU'RE NOT EATING ENOUGH
9/12/2018 0 Comments
 
When it comes to fitness goals, especially weight loss, nutrition is the biggest and most important piece of the pie. Yet one of the most common things we see with people's diets, especially those with weight loss goals, is that they're not actually eating enough. 
​This can be for lots of reasons, including underestimation of calorie targets, subtracting too many exercise calories or simply not knowing the correct information when it comes to nutrition and dieting. Regardless, not eating enough calories can have major implications, therefore knowing the signs are your first lesson in ensuring you're fuelling your body properly.
Regardless of your diet, it's important to know two main things when it comes to calories: 1) Ensuring that you’re getting enough calories for your basal metabolic rate and 2) your current activity level. Both of these can be calculated using our macro blueprint (even if you’re not interested in knowing your macros) to ensure you're eating enough every day. If you think you might not be, here are some signs you're not eating enough and what you can do to fix it.
#1) You have that 2pm crash

Calories are energy. So if you’re not getting enough calories you’re not going to have enough energy - it's that simple. Even if you’re not exercising or dieting, you need to be able to consume enough calories per day to support basic body function (known as your basal metabolic rate). If you're not exercising and eating below 1,000 calories this can slow metabolic rate and cause fatigue. Additionally if you are exercising but not eating enough to support that activity, surprise! You'll still feel tired. We see this most in people who say they hit that 2pm lull. So it's obvious that not adequately fuelling your body will effect your energy levels, causing physical tiredness and mental fatigue. So rather than relying on an additional cup of coffee in the afternoon, ensure you're getting enough calories.
​How to avoid this: Be sure to eat early in the morning, especially meals containing healthy fats (like nuts and seeds, olive oils and avocados) that promote cerebral function. Additionally, if you know you're prone to the hitting an afternoon wall, prepare an afternoon snack.
#2) You're ravenous by late afternoon/early evening

Hunger is an obvious sign of under-eating, but it's been found that hunger and specific food cravings increase in response to restricted calories due to changes in different hormones that control hunger and fullness. Additionally, under-eating will likely increase the production of cortisol, which is also linked to hunger. 
How to avoid this: Eat in the morning, even if you're not feeling particularly hungry. Eating early will help control cortisol levels and go along way to managing hunger throughout the day. Ensure you're eating foods that are high in protein that will keep you feeling full. 
#3) You're irritable

Hanger is for real people! If you’re not getting enough calories you can have a drop in blood sugar levels which can cause irritability. This can even extend further into headaches, feeling lightheaded and nausea. No one
How to avoid this: Try eating smaller meals more often. Also, don't forget the obvious solution and eat as soon as you feel irritability setting in.
#4) You're not regular (period and/or poop wise)

It’s not surprising that if you don’t have enough going in, you’re not going to have enough going out. And while some people may not be comfortable talking about, your stool/bowel movements and your period (for the ladies) say a lot about your diet.

When it comes to your poop: When you have less food to convert to stool, it can mean having fewer bowel movements and/or harder stool. Though fibre is considered the most important in maintaining regular bowel function, even eating enough of that won’t help if you’re not eating enough calories in general. This can lead to constipation (classified as having fewer than 3 bowel movements per week) and harder stool that's difficult or painful to pass. 

When it comes to your period: Not getting enough calories can also negatively affect your hormone production and thus your period, and more seriously, your reproductive success. This is because if your body feels it's not getting enough calories, it will ""think"" that something’s wrong and start prioritizing your physiological needs. This means basic acts like breathing, swallowing and circulating blood take priority over non-essential functions like getting your period. Hormone production becomes impaired and you may lose your period and/or feel reduced sexual desire. This can also happen to especially active individuals or those with low body fat percentages.
How to avoid this: Eat! Ensure regular meals and calories that meet your daily demand and account for your activity level. And don't forget water and fibre!
#5) You're not sleeping well

You know how they say ""when your stomach is empty and your mind is full, it's very hard to sleep""? Well we know that the first part of that saying is definitely true. Studies have linked strict dieting and reduced calorie intake to poor sleep, in addition to making falling asleep more difficult and spending less time in deep sleep. If you feel hungry when you're trying to fall asleep or first thing in the morning after you wake up, it's a sign you're not getting enough to eat. This can then also feed in to the other signs we mentioned above like irritability and lack of energy.
How to avoid this: Don't be afraid to eat at night! First of all, calories don't know what time it is, so that myth that eating after dark will cause you to gain weight has been long since debunked. Instead ensure you get enough protein and healthy fats before bed to ensure proper restful sleep and avoid late-night hunger and the common associated problems like late-night binge eating.
Moral of the story

It’s easy to see how all of these things can affect other areas of your life include mood, anxiety, school/work performance and your social life. Therefore it's important to be aware of your body and what it's telling you. Note if you have any of these signs and consider if it could be because you're getting enough calories. Remember that calories are not the enemies and you need to be eating enough of the right foods to maintain your metabolism, physiological functions and energy levels. 

Lastly, remember that it's so important to be smart about weight loss. You should never just stop eating in order to lose weight. Your body needs calories to survive and the proper proportions of macronutrients (yes, even carbs) to support your body and daily activities.",nutrition,1537292657,MadisonChebonne,2,1,True,2018-09-18

Let's say, for the sake of argument, that one was completely turned off by the near religious zealotry and wackadoodle fanaticism of both sides and opted to eat a diet where the macronutrient ratios weren't extreme.

Religious zealotry and ideological nonsense and agendas aside, what can be said about a diet that looks something like 50% carbs, 30% fat, 20% protein?

I have a history of disordered eating and if I see the amount of calories I'm eating then it's very likely that seeing a four digit number will freak me out a bit and lead me to restricting again. If anyone knows of an app that has an option to hide your caloric intake, that'd be really useful to me. I'm not sure if such a thing exists, so if all else fails I could just try using a regular nutrition app and see how it goes.....or just continue doing what I'm doing now and not get too caught up in specific numbers.",nutrition,1537309092,rosequarks,20,73,True,2018-09-18

Question about Plant vs. Animal Proteins - Inflammation and Crohn's,"[This](https://nutritionfacts.org/2012/09/20/why-meat-causes-inflammation/) article by Michael Greger, M.D., argues that meat is inflammatory.

[This](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/preventing-crohns-disease-with-diet/) video of his about diet and Crohn's has an excerpt from a study that says ""diets rich in animal protein and animal fat cause a decrease in beneficial bacteria in the intestine"".

Weekly Diet,"I'm doing a diet I can stick to, I just want to know if it's too bad from a nutrition standpoint. I'm a 25 year-old male of about 82kg.  


Most of the diet consists of:  


Breakfast(12:00)  
\- 2 whole eggs(140 cals)  
\- 2 slices of ham(40 cals)  
\- Frozen Veggies(70 cals)  
Sometimes I have some cheese(80 cals) or egg whites as an extra. This is around 250-340 cals of breakfast and very satiating.  


Lunch(3:00)  
\- Protein of different sorts, 200 grams. Most of the time it's chicken, 95/5 lean ground beef or fish(260-300 cals)  
\- Frozen Veggies(70 cals)  
Sometimes I add some cactus tortilla quesadilla w/ham for 150 cals.  


Snack(6:00)  
\- Cappuccino(80 cals)  
\- Sliced cucumber with salt and lemon juice(40-80 cals)  
Sometimes I have an apple or frozen strawberries or even cactus tortilla quesadilla with ham, depending whether I was satiated or not  


Dinner(9:00)  
\- A bowl of high fiber cereal(30-40 grams of high fiber cereal which is about 110-140 cals + delactosed milk which is around the same)  
If I still want something else I can make a cactus tortilla quesadilla w/ham(I really enjoy those), another bowl of cereal, or another bowl of non-fiber cereal, or frozen strawberries.  
I'm thinking of switching this for a higher protein dinner. I've found a place that sells tuna(which I LOVE) for about $1.5 the pound, so I can buy enough of it for a budget.  


This is mostly all my week, and I enjoy it and find it easy to stick to it. On thursdays for lunch I go visit my dad and brother's and basically eat whatever it is he serves, which is mostly steak w/ pasta.  
On the weekends I can or cannot break this. I mean, I follow the same format of veggies + protein, but sometimes I can snack on cereal, or eat a chocolate. Or if I go out I eat whatever(mostly on dates, so it's either something from the cinema like soft ice-cream, or a coffee, or a sandwich)  
I've noticed fat loss(which is the main focus), but as I had an injury and find it hard to go to the gym I had stopped going to the gym, and seeing that I would be somewhat low on protein and very low on calories, I don't want to lose muscle instead of fat and now that I'm better of my injury(I'm not sure what it was because it wasn't gym-related, or it didn't seem to be gym-related and afterwards I COULD go to the gym but I was carrying heavy weights and decided to go safer in recovery) I will go to the gym and again and basically do 5X5 which has always worked very well for me.  
I'm also thinking of increasing veggies and protein intake by switching the dinner for another protein/veggie combo.  


What do you guys think? The main focus is to lose fat without it being unhealthy(hence a lot of different kind of frozen veggies). As for the stickiness and consistency of the diet, I find it to be easy to follow, tasty and satisfying, so mainly it's the not-being unhealthy part",nutrition,1537375148,sismetic,0,1,True,2018-09-19

What is the Healthiest Cooking Oil?,"Hi r/nutrition Community. Here's a question that's stumped me: what's the healthiest vegetable oil for cooking? Before answering, considering the following scientific hypotheses that have received empirical evidence in nutritional literature:

1. A diet low in saturated fat reduces cardiovascular disease risk by increasing HDL and decreasing LDL. Thus, the optimal vegetable oil is one with **lower saturated fat, like Canola, Safflower, and Flaxseed oil.** This is intuitive, given that animal products are high in saturated fats.
2. A diet with either high Omega-3 fatty acids and/or a lower Omega-6:Omega-3 fatty acid profile is beneficial for cardiovascular health, mental health, and reducing the risk of cancer and inflammation. Thus, the optimal vegetable oil is one with **more Omega-3 fatty acids, like Flaxseed oil.**
3. Cooking oils lower in polyunsaturated fats have lower smoke-points, and thus can produce reactive free-radicals under high heat conditions, thereby increasing the risk of cancer. Thus, the optimal vegetable oil is one with **less polyunsaturated fats, like Safflower oil and Olive oil.**

Obviously, there are some conflicting views here. What do you think? I look forward to your insight!

To what extent does caffeine interfere with bulking?,"To what extent does caffeine interfere with bulking? 


The new leangains book mentions that caffeine does improve the thermic effect of food/ muscle glycogen synthesis.

High protein diet and aging - is there a real correlation?,"I was talking to my mom today about macros and how I'm reassessing my ratio. I used an automatic calculator online and selected ""low-carb"" (I really like fat, and don't have anything against carbs - I just prefer to use my calories for avocados/nuts rather than bread). The calculator suggested my macro breakdown should be such:

68grams carbs a day (20%)  
68grams fat a day (45%)  
118grams of protein a day (35%)

Now - the 118 grams of protein surprised me, but I know that body-builders tend to consume that much, so I didn't blink too hard. 

Anyway, I mentioned this to my mom and she started going off on how super-high protein diets are being linked with premature aging, and how I shouldn't eat that much, etc. Here's the thing - my mom tends to jump on board with anything Dr. Mercola farts out, and I'm a little dubious of her opinion as a result (she jumped on the antioxidant craze too, and is all about Keto and IF right now). ^(I have nothing against those diets or people who practice them, but I am really conservative when it comes to scientific studies etc; I'd prefer to stick to general consensus nutrition advice - Keto and IF proponents, please don't debate the merits of your diets here - that's not the topic at hand.)On the other hand, sometimes she's really right about nutrition-things ahead of the curve. It's a mixed bag.

My question is this: is there any truth to what she's saying? Have high-protein diets been linked to premature aging? Is the science robust enough to take seriously at this point, or is it still preliminary? 

And also - I do feel that 118 grams of protein is a lot. What do you think, reddit? ",nutrition,1537399300,anon194029,5,3,True,2018-09-19

What's the deal with soy? (Sorry if this is not the right place to ask),"My mom recently bought these supplements that are supposed to support vagina and bone health. What I found interesting was that on the package, it said that it contained no estrogen or isoflavones, despite having soy in one of the main ingredients. I checked the soymilk in our fridge (Trader Joes) and at the very front it says that the soymilk has isoflavones. 

Are isoflavones bad or something? Does soymilk really mimick estrogen? And to what extent? 

I'm curious about this because I was diagnosed as lactose intolerant at the age of 2, so my mom put me on toddler soy formula and from that point on, I just drank soymilk. I also heard that soymilk can cause early menarche. I got my first period when I was 12. My sister was never lactose intolerant and didn't drink soy, just milk, and she got her first period at the age of 12 also. My mom never drank soy growing up, just milk, and she got her period at age 11.

These studies, however, seem to say that soy can cause early menarche. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3443957/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3443957/) 

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221822961\_Early-life\_soy\_exposure\_and\_age\_at\_menarche](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221822961_Early-life_soy_exposure_and_age_at_menarche)

These suggest that it doesn't have an impact on age of menarche, but soy could potentially cause longer period cycles:

[https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-13-54](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2891-13-54)

[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194106](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/194106)

Doesn't dairy also have estrogen? The estrogen found in soy is a phytoestrogen (plant estrogen) and in dairy the estrogen is an animal estrogen. If anything, shouldn't dairy be causing early menarche? Since it's an animal estrogen.

C-vitamin and exercise,"So I've been thinking: is c-vitamin linked to recovery from a fast paced aerobic exercise? Particularly sprinting aka interval training. I've lately noticed that usually after when I've  done these interval runs then I feel this unbelievable craving for orange juice. Icy blackcurrants in a shake will do too. I wondered if it's about sugar, but I don't crave for candies or chocolate or bananas at that point at all. Just juicy orange juice or something cold that has citrus fruits in them. 

Now that I think about I've always liked citrus fruits. When I was young I drank orange juice all the time. I love lemon and lime too. There must be some evolutionary reason for this right?
I'd add that I have the type of muscles that are good for explosive training. I run really fast short sprints but I suck at long distance runs. I read that explosive strength is correlated with testosterone levels. It just so happens that I have pretty high overall t-levels. Isn't c-vitamin supposed to have a connection with testosterone? 

I didn't find any studies conserning c-vitamin and interval training. All I could find was that c-vitamin maybe bad for the recovery after anaerobic training. So I was wondering if you guys have any experience about these sorts of cravings in relation to exercise. ",nutrition,1537447573,carnivalcrash,0,1,True,2018-09-20

Food sourced VS Synthetically Sourced Nutrition🤔,"

I grew up taking vitamins like the Flintstones vitamins and even vitamin c for extra support 😅 , but I would still get sick and I would see people who were eating healthy and taking daily vitamins also get sick or even come down with chronic conditions like disease and even cancer. So I believed it was just something that happened to some and not others 🤷‍♀️ but after learning more about nutrition I see why it is happening to so many of us...

Today's nutritional content in food is at an all-time low. We have to eat 8 oranges to get the same amount of vitamin A that our grandparents got from 1 orange 🤯 on top of that 95% of the vitamins available (including vitamins prescribed from doctors!) are synthetically made. Because of this they are missing co-factors like trace minerals, lipids, amino acids, and the phytonutrients.

Since this is what we have to work with I would suggest that everyone take food sourced vitamins each day to make sure we are all the way covered. My family and I take the daily vitamins suggested by Dr. Erik Reis and other healthcare professional who encourage and integrative health approach because they are completely food sourced, cover all the recommended daily vitamins that are recommended in one product so it keeps me from buying a bunch of different vitamins and also provides me with minerals, probiotics, digestive enzymes, and immune support.

The nutritional information is listed under fact sheet and Dr. Erik Reis goes into more detail on the video linked to his name above.

Knowledge is valuable and sharing it is key!! 🗝️ Hoping this helps someone else as much as it has helped me and my family. ♥️ If anybody has any specific questions I would be more than happy to ask my acupuncturist who specializes in gut health or my nutritionist who specializes in diabetes.. or I could connect y'all if that is easier lol

Lower triglycerides and cholesterol?,"Are there any particular things I can do or eat to lower these both?
I just don’t want know what to eat at this point. 

What I usually eat throughout the day.

In the morning: 
A fruit, usually a nectarine.
1-2 oz of almonds
1 Apple and 2 Cups of Celery

Afternoon:
1-1.5 Cup pumpkin seeds
Salad with kale, cabbage, brocolli, and Brussels
Lunch with usually either eggs(rarely)or wild caught salmon (with asparagus, spinach, brocolli, cauliflower, Brussels, and zucchini on the side. 2-3 cups of vegetables total) I know eggs raise cholesterol but I usually eat salmon more than eggs anyways. Eggs I eat not too often.
Smoothie: Banana, 2/3 Cup berries, 1 Cup almond milk, 1 Tbsp chia seeds

Night:
Same Salad
Probably another fruit like kiwi, watermelon, or more berries
Dinner: Same as lunch but I add an avocado too.

"Does anyone else have ""healthy"" cravings?","Hello everyone, I have a few questions surrounding one topic. 

I get my bloodwork done only about every other year or so, so I don't always know if I'm deficient in something or not (I don't think there are people out there who get it done more than twice a year, so I gues I'm not the only one.).   
But sometimes I just start craving certain foods, and not the kind of food you'd assume one would crave like ice-cream, pizza or chocolate (high-fat, high-carb, highly processed and palatable). I start craving lentils (just plain lentils, no salt, just cooked in water), plain raw butternut squash, melons. For example, last week I ate about 1lbs of lentils everyday because I was craving them so badly and they tasted amazing to me. 

And now to my questions: Does anyone else get these - how should I call them - healthy cravings, whole-food cravings, nutrient-dense-food cravings? Are there reasons for it, like, does the body know it's deficient in iron or something and then starts craving these specific foods? Is this the reason that they taste better if you eventually eat them when you crave them (because I'm not particularly fond of unseasoned lentils or plain steamed broccoli normally)?

Daily Protein Requirements for Weightlifters,"I read someplace that there's a limit to the amount of protein that can be absorbed for use in single meal.

Some people recommend consuming, say, 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (I may be off on the exact figure, but please bear with me).  My question is: is this type of protein recommendation being made because you need that much protein for rebuilding muscles, or are they keeping in mind that some may be converted into glucose, so they basically ""guess high""?

ELI5: To what extent is the “calories in &lt; calories out” model dependent on the type of food being consumed?,"I’m a moderate exerciser and have experimented with my diet for quite some time now.

What I’ve always regarded as gospel is the “calories in vs calories out” model, which states that regardless of food type, as long as you’re burning more than you’re consuming, you will lose weight.

While typically this has proved true with me, ever since I started intermittent fasting, things have been getting complicated.

I figured since I have only one big meal a day (usually a snack for lunch and a big dinner) that I could start eating more pizza, fast food, generally carby foods and whatnot.

Keep in mind that I have a good eye for calorie intake and am mindful of everything I eat.

While I have stayed in my calorie deficit, I have noticed that the fat loss isn’t as apparent as it used to be, even when I was eating more meals and seemingly more food.

I’m beginning to think that content of what is eaten plays as an important of a role as the number of calories themselves.

I know I sound like a noob here, but coming from my mind, which has always assumed the calories in/out is the only factor in fat loss, Im surprised and realized I have a lot to learn.

Sulforaphane ft. MSM powder (aka Methylsulfonylmethane),"Hey r/nutrition, I’ve got some questions and hope you guys might have some answers.

I started getting into Dr. Rhonda Patrick’s podcasts and enjoy her approach so far. If you did the same you probably noticed she’s really into Sulforaphane, you can see her talk about it [here](https://youtu.be/0UqxC2RDF64) . 

Prior to finding this, I knew absolutely nothing about this supplement (and still know very little, tbh), but I looked up the formula and it reminded me of the formula for MSM, which I’ve used before, and it was the only supplement (except some B-complex kinds) I used and can vouch for its effects - my heavy PMS disappeared for 6 months, my hair grew like crazy and the afternoon sluggishness was gone. Needless to say, I can’t wait to get into it again after this long pause I’m doing now.

From what I hear from her in this podcast, the effects are fairly similar for both of these supplements, but my knowledge of organic chemistry is laughable so I can’t discern the difference from their formulas alone. 

Does anybody have any experience with this? Am I completely off with my thinking they are similar?

"Which of these two types of cheese would be my healthier bet: cheddar dyed yellow, no modified milk ingredients, or undyed mozzarella with modified milk ingredients.","I live very rurally, and my grocery store has stopped stocking what I considered to be all around the best cheese on the shelf: undyed cheddar with no modified milk ingredients (mmi). Made in my country, too. 

I did a bit of digging with regards to mmi, and couldn't decide for myself if it seemed a good idea to avoid or not. I read about inflammation. All in all, I feel like I'll probably be better off to avoid it. The presence of mmi in my food does change the taste and make me eat more cheese (which is not my goal here - I want to eat a small to moderate amount only). 

I'm also pretty certain that dyes aren't great to consume either (I really do NOT understand why this is allowed in the first place).

Questions about carbohydrates and glycogen storage in relation to soccer/football,"Hi guys. I'm a semi-professional footballer in Denmark looking to understand how i can fill up my glycogen stores before games and how it all works and hoped to learn a bit from some of you. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What (i think) i understand** is that carbohydrates will be converted into glycogen which will then be available to help optimize performance in games so eating a lot of carbs is the aim.

&amp;#x200B;

**What i don't understand**

how long does it take for carbs to be converted into glycogen and how long will they be stored for until they'll be converted into fat?  

How much can one store and how would one achieve full storage? Does it take a whole week or can you do it the day before a game?

Does it matter where you get the carbs from? I mean i'm pretty sure you can't just eat spoons of white sugar and be good to go but why not if it all ends up as glycogen?

For example, we have Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in Cyprus that do not list the calories.

A thorough-looking collection of factors that affect iron absorption and bioavailability,"I personally find balancing my nutrients to be really difficult, so this article helps me understand the factors that aren't always talked about. It is just a collection of a lot of research that talks about all the factors. I feel like it should be handy for people to understand how to get the best balance for their diet.

It's technically published in a research journal, but it's old research. So, does this count for research discussion? let me know. I'll repost if needed.

[https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/91/5/1461S/4597424](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/91/5/1461S/4597424)

ABSTRACT

Iron differs from other minerals because iron balance in the human body is regulated by absorption only because there is no physiologic mechanism for excretion. On the basis of intake data and isotope studies, iron bioavailability has been estimated to be in the range of 14–18% for mixed diets and 5–12% for vegetarian diets in subjects with no iron stores, and these values have been used to generate dietary reference values for all population groups. Dietary factors that influence iron absorption, such as phytate, polyphenols, calcium, ascorbic acid, and muscle tissue, have been shown repeatedly to influence iron absorption in single-meal isotope studies, whereas in multimeal studies with a varied diet and multiple inhibitors and enhancers, the effect of single components has been, as expected, more modest. The importance of fortification iron and food additives such as erythorbic acid on iron bioavailability from a mixed diet needs clarification. The influence of vitamin A, carotenoids, and nondigestible carbohydrates on iron absorption and the nature of the “meat factor” remain unresolved. The iron status of the individual and other host factors, such as obesity, play a key role in iron bioavailability, and iron status generally has a greater effect than diet composition. It would therefore be timely to develop a range of iron bioavailability factors based not only on diet composition but also on subject characteristics, such as iron status and prevalence of obesity.",nutrition,1537816392,SlapstickVampire,0,6,True,2018-09-24

Satiety - calorie density or volume?,"Which one is a better one to deal with satiety? For example, when shopping I aim to get products which are 200-300 calories per 100 grams. Today I saw some products in the 375-500 range, however they seemed to have plenty of volume (suggesting that they are lighter by mass - take more space with the same weight), like rice cakes, for example.

I have read recently that apart from good protein and fat being better than processed carbohydrate, and also the necessity to have fiber, it is the weight of a product which helps with satiety (as well as product beneficially being made largely of water, like cucumbers), hinting on the need to get as little as calories per 100 grams (subjectively - for example, 250 is better than 750 in this case).

However I would like to know how good is it to get more calories per 100 grams if the product seems to take more volume? Or is it outside only and in the stomach in gets squashed and it goes back to have as much weight - less calories per 100 grams?

I was thinking about such volume products like popcorn (also read anecdotes people mention they help with satiety, despite being 375-500 calories per 100 grams), rice cookies, etc.

So if I workout and then eat 55 grams of protein,  35 of which will go towards muscle repair, what happens to the 20 ""unused"" grams of protein? Does it really just become fat? Or will our bodies use it for energy like carbs and dietary fats?",nutrition,1537900084,MyKeyblader,1,1,True,2018-09-25

"Oxalates, kidney stones, and juicing","Hello everyone. I have a question about oxalates and kidney stones. I can not eat a lot of fiberous veggies, like just eating large amounts of raw or even cooked greens. I know that increasing calcium in the diet reduces oxalate-calcium kidney stones, but calcium supplements actually increase them. I was thinking about taking low oxalate greens, like watercress and kale and arugula, and juicing them in order to get the calcium from them. But since I am not consuming it in it's ""whole"" form, does the calcium in the juice isolate the calcium from something in some way that makes it no better than taking a supplement? I don't really want to have to eat dairy at the moment because I found I felt better removing it, but I'm finding it hard to get enough calcium from sources that aren't super high in oxalates and other antinutrients, like almonds or soybeans, other than sardines. I'm hoping juicing low oxalate greens will be a good way to get a little bit more in. Thank you.",nutrition,1537905832,thejakesummers,2,1,True,2018-09-25

ON the surface they both eat very healthy, but I think their macro nutrients are completely unbalanced which is ultimately causing their weight gain. Neither eats junk food but they both love sweet potatoes and they will often each eat a large serving of SP as a snack. I could be completely wrong but my understanding is that unless you are mid workout or refueling after one the majority of the carbs will be stored as fat because the body doesn't need that much instant energy. If anyone could share any articles that explain this process I would be really thankful. If im completely wrong, I guess this will be a learning experience for us both!

Their appetite is nearly gone, so when they can't eat normally, they prefer this stuff (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001W6RHK2/ref=ox_sc_act_image_3?smid=AG47OA4F4J6V8&amp;psc=1), as it goes down easy, doesn't make them ""feel full,"" and doesn't have that milky/chalky typical ensure/boost texture/taste.

The only problem here is, the sugar content. This person gets very jittery with added sugars in their diet. So, I was wondering if there is any way I can make a blend to my own, with the same amount of calories (much needed), without the high sugar count? *Some* sugar is OK, but not as much as this stuff!

Question about No Meat Days,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

This is a question for all but perhaps more appropriate for those who pursue a whole foods, plant-based diet for the most part. I was wondering for those of you who do integrate meat into their diets how many days a week do you do no meat? And on those days do you allow yourself eggs, dairy, etc. or just go strictly plant-based on them? What are some of the benefits of integrating no meat days into weekly nutritional profiles?

1) Nutritiondata.self.com's estimation that 100 grams of carrot contains more than 300% of the recommended daily amount of vitamin A, and 
2) Cronometer (the calorie++ tracking app) estimating more than 500%. Basically, the person who reacted wondered whether these numbers were misleading, given the possibility of the body absorbing the vitamins inefficiently.

Curious about mood and nutrition,"I have been dealing with moodiness for the past year and just recently have been getting a handle on it.

So I have noticed that eating low carb generally keeps my mood elevated. Now I have also recently heard that a carnivore diet does an even better job of this. Perhaps this combined with a eating less frequently further improves this. What seems to be happening is that the blood sugar is being stabilized. 

Another thing that I have personally is consume curcumin with biopeperine, fish oil, and grape seed extract. The first two lower inflammation which affects mood while the second lowers aromatase.

The last thing I am doing (while struggling) is lowering caffeine and ￼alcohol. My thought is that they impact sleep, but also spike dopamine levels for a while which I assume down-regulate them later. Is there much noticeable difference with this?

TEF and large amounts of calories,"Talking OMAD and caloric surplus, let's take a person with a TDEE of 2500 who eats 5000 calories that day

We assume a fair macro split despite relatively a cheat meal (/day - since it's an ""OMAD) (why else eat so much if not to cheat?)

I heard about a higher TEF for protein first and then carbs (25, 10%), and then like 2.5% for fats

Lastly the person will run a 500 deficit for 5 days to compensate and keep real weight the same

My question is if this 5000 OMAD will all get absorbed or if TEF (average of 12.5% (?) here) will make a difference? Usually TEF is like 5-10% (125-250 cals on TDEE of 2500)

The point is if I eat 2500 over maintenance will all 2500 go to fat or due to TEF it will be less? What about 5000 over maintenance?

What exactly is wrong with sugar?,"The way I see it, sugar is just a glucose molecule connected to a fructose molecule. The individual molecules are then split apart somewhere in your digestive tract. So already 50% of the energy from sugar is just regular old glucose no different than that from any other food source. Then there's the 50% fructose. From what I've read, it goes to your liver where it's converted into glucose, lactate, glycogen and fatty acids. The first two are used as energy, the third is a store of energy. Could the problem be from the fatty acids? According to wikipedia, under 1% of fructose contributes to plasma triglycerides. But if the triglycerides were a problem then eating regular fruit would be a bad idea since the fructose has the same metabolic fate regardless of the fiber in the fruit. 

Some quick, back of the napkin calculations: If you ate 100g of sugar, that would be 50g of fructose. Assuming 1% of that gets converted into plasma triglycerides, you would increase the total amount of your plasma triglycerides by 0.5g or 500 mg. Assuming you have 500 decilitres of blood, you would increase you plasma triglycerides by 1mg/decilitre. Normal triglyceride levels are &lt;150mg/decilitre. So you would have to eat copious amounts of sugar to increase your triglyceride levels by any meaningful degree, so that surely couldn't be the culprit of its harmfulness.

"If you reduce calory intake, does the body start using stored fat to fuel the brain instead of slowing it down?","I have watched some videos, and it said the body first use food, and then use stored fat, and then the muscles. Also, it said that the body lowers energy consumption by slowing down the brain when we don't eat food.

So, what if we eat food, but lower calories? For example, most people eat grains like bread, boiled rice, etc. I guess they make up a great portion of calories. So, for example, if you eat as you usually do, but with smaller portion of boiled rice, as smaller as to make the total calory intake is slightly below your required calory intake, does the body start using stored fat (let's assume that you still have unnecessary fat somewhere like your belly) immediately, not trying to save energy by reducing brain functions?",nutrition,1538315597,evolution2015,23,74,True,2018-09-30

Due to not feeling so swell the last couple of months and having trouble sleeping, I had some blood work done.

Guaranteed Feel-Good Healthy Smoothy,"I know how to create smoothies that make you feel much better and help your health. I started making this because the ingredients are good for healing your teeth naturally with nutrients, but it also does a lot to make your body feel much better. Junk food makes me feel sick, sluggish, and tired, but the smoothie makes me feel good &amp; normal. Your teeth need vitamins A, E, D, K, and K2 plus magnesium and minerals to repair themselves. Teeth are living bones just like the bones in the rest of your body, which also continuously rebuild themselves. Dentists lie and say that teeth are just inanimate objects that can't do anything for themselves and can only be repaired with drills, fillings, and crowns. Bullshit. Teeth have pulp, nerves and blood inside them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok first of all, you can use some highly nutritious fruits such as papaya (including the papaya seeds) and berries, but this part is optional.  OK then you put in a few leaves of kale, torn into small pieces. Then add 1 tablespoon wheat germ oil, because it has a lot of vitamin E and other healthy things. Then add 1 or 2 tablespoons of bee pollen, which is a superfood with a huge amount &amp; variety of nutrients and 5000 different enzymes. Then add a tablespoon of Kerry Gold butter, which is grass fed butter and has vitamin K2 in it. Cheap butter doesn't have K2 because it's not grass fed. Then you put in a tablespoon of kelp powder. This is for minerals, which you're probably not getting enough of due to food being grown in depleted soils by farmers who don't care about your health. Then you blend this up and drink a cup of it. Then you also take some cod liver oil. I take two capsules of it. It has high amounts of vitamins A &amp; D. Then you also take a magnesium pill because vitamin D can't work without magnesium. I guarantee that a few hours after you drink this and take the pills, your body will feel good and if you have any tooth discomfort, your teeth will feel much better too.

Why is sugar such a problem,"It's not the calories. Fructose is exceedingly rare in nature and as such our bodies did not evolve to digest it. Glucose is used for energy by all cells in your body, while fructose has to be converted in the liver.

It has negative impact on:

\- Insulin and thus leads to diabetes and obesity and then heart disease. This affect satiety: all the calories are stored so the body wants more food

\- Digestion - evidence it contributes to creating holes in intestines, and creating harmful bacteria that disturb your microbiome

\- Liver fat because it has to transform the fructose into fat and cannot send it out quickly enough

\- Alzheimer, also called Type 3 diabetes because it messes with the insulin resistance of the brain (yes there is such a thing)

\- Gout due to uric acid side-product

\- Cancer: due to repeat harm to multiple parts coupled with creation of excess free radicals in its metabolization

\- Rotten teeth: English royalty were the first to eat sugar. Commoners blackened their teeth to look more royal. Enough said

Up to date literature on Imanuel Pevzner diets (USSR dietitian)?,"Pevzner created a set of diets in 1921, mainly directed at people suffering from certain health issues.

They seem reasonably sound, but some decisions seem rather unscientific and/or cultural (and possibly motivated by politics rather than health).

For example, spicy food is almost always forbidden (when the current medical opinion is mixed at worst); leafy vegetables, garlic and onion are also forbidden in many cases that I fail to make sense of (e.g. leafy greens being bad for ulcers).

When looking for an analysis on these diets from a western medicine perspective I am unable to find anything: most sources are ex-USSR countries where, surprisingly, these diets are still prescribed by physicians.

What vitamins/minerals am I missing out on?,"Hello r/nutrition this is my first post here, so let me know if I'm not following the rules from the Personal Nutrition post. I've read over the FAQ on related topics, but I think my post may be more specific and ultimately I'm looking into where the following diet may be lacking.  
  
I've recently started tracking my macros and setting goals for myself in order to change my body in certain ways. I thought it would be incredibly interesting to create a ""shake"" which allows me to fine tune my macros to my daily goals using a system of linear equations involving macro/caloric goals. The ultimate goal is to be able to consume only this shake for months at a time while ensuring my body is getting everything it needs. I have had this shake for weeks at a time with no supplementary food, but I grow nervous of various vitamins/minerals that I might be missing out on. Now, I usually have a range of food throughout the week to cover for these deficiencies, but I don't want to have to do that (if possible). The shake consists of the following:  
* Hemp Seed Oil  
* Hemp Protein  
* Brown Rice Protein  
* Pea Protein  
* Rolled Oats (or more recently Oat Powder, essentially the same thing)  
  
I am able to mix these ingredients in various proportions in order to hit a wide range of macro goals that I may be trying to achieve in a given day/week/month. From my research, I have chosen these ingredients because I am able to get all essential amino acids and oils and a lot of insoluble fiber to...keep things moving.

How to clear up myths about cancerous foods,"Here's the deal: My mother had breast cancer about 15 years ago. Luckily she is all fine again today, although she gets nervous before her annual checkups. I can totally understand that but at the same time the fear of cancer has taken over in the kitchen, and that is something that bothers me.

Take the example of oil. She cooks with ghee, butter or coconut fat/oil. Now, while I get that it is important to make sure the oil doesn't start to smoke when frying, I don't think it has to be these forms of fat that are super high in saturated fats. I'm coming from the perspective of nutritional labels and she's coming from a fear of cancer. But she implicitly neglects other issues such as heart disease (for the record, we have no other history of heart disease or cancer in the family). I tried to convince her to try olive oil (not the fancy virgin olive oil kind but the refined version that can be heated beyond 200°C, but then she argues that it isn't as good quality as unrefined oil). Having organic label food matters to her, nutritional value (in a macro sense) doesn't. 

She will also rather trust some random health food shop (and slightly esoteric) book without scientific references over academic sources, despite being very intelligent. Therefore she cooks everything at low temperatures. Health (with respect to avoiding cancerous foods) over taste. And for anyone who likes a slightly caramelised piece of meat, it is hard to eat one that has been super well done in the oven for an hour or in the pan at a low temperature for far too long. 

Now I'm looking for ideas to slowly shift the focus a bit. Or good reading material that clears up with all the myths out there.

Sugar addiction?,"Okay, I’ll try to keep this short.

I (21F) have been lifting/working out for about 2 years now. When I first started I was a cardio junkie and was restricting myself to ~700-1000 calories a day. I developed a binging disorder because of this that I have been working on for a while now.

Before my intense restricting, I wasn’t even big on sweets, I was more of a savory person. But for some reason my binges were always super high in carbs and sugars. Because of this I now have a really bad sugar addiction. I’m always craving desserts and sweets, and there is no way I can eat an appropriate portion. My binging in general has gotten better, my only trigger now is sweets.

The reason I’m posting this on the nutrition thread is because I’m considering ways to try and overcome my sugar addiction. I’ve been considering going no added sugar for a while, but I’m in grad school and am afraid that the side effects may not mix well with all the other stress I have going on. That may just be an excuse my mind is making up though.

I've been experimenting with eating a lot of candy right before going to the gym, and the results have been pretty amazing.

Diet question,"Hello everyone I'm new to diets and I've got some questions

Up until recently I've been able to eat just about anything in life but now the doctor says otherwise.

It's been a great diet I've lost 25 lbs over three months and I've hit the ideal weight for my height. Now I need to switch to a weight MAINTENANCE diet based more-or-less on the alkaline diet because my system is sensitive to acids. Im always a little hungry but it's an energized hunger rather than a drained hunger  My only complaint about this alkaline business so far is that I haven't found any dishes that are truly filling I constantly crave meat and I'm tired of being hungry.

Tackling Childhood Obesity - Who Is Responsible?,"Having studied nutrition for many years I firmly believe that a good diet is the keystone to a long and healthy life; furthermore, it should start as early as possible. The role of a nutritionist is to help people to improve their diet, whether it be to lose weight or to address medical issues; I get great satisfaction from what I do but the one thing that truly upsets me the most is seeing overweight and obese children... and I hate to say it but that frequency is increasing. 

As adults we are solely responsible for ourselves, no one forces us to eat unhealthy food, we make that choice and we have to deal with the consequences but for children it is different, particularly for younger pre-school children. Parents and guardians have an enormous responsibility to ensure that their children are fed a healthy balanced diet, as far as I am concerned it is simply part of being a parent, but unfortunately my opinion is not shared by everyone and the UK is on the verge of a childhood obesity crisis.

I must admit that I do have a certain degree of understanding and do (kind of) empathise with parents; the fast/junk food industry is very powerful and knows exactly what it is doing with regards to advertising and making their products appealing to it's target audience, but we as a nation have reached the point where something has to give, this cannot continue. Young children are like sponges, they are constantly absorbing new information and being influenced by the strongest messages; the message on nutrition has to change.

In many ways it should be easy to set a child off on the right nutritional path, they are so easy to educate and will believe almost anything you tell them; they can easily be ‘persuaded’ to try new foods and the early years are crucial for establishing the foundations for a healthy relationship with food. However, in my experience many children are not being shown the best way, it is in fact the parents that need educating in the first instance; ultimately if the parent has poor knowledge of the importance of a healthy diet then there is every chance that the child will follow suit.

So what is the answer? For me the responsibility lies firmly at the feet of the parents; of course I do realise that as children get older they will make more of their own decisions so the education has to start early. I wholeheartedly support any schemes that help in the education of children but in this day and age where there is so much support and free information readily available online, parents have little excuse. Even if a parent is overweight and chooses unhealthy food for themselves, it is uncondonable to inflict the same on a child who is in no position to argue. Children grow and develop very quickly, they need to be given the best chance possible of becoming healthy and happy young adults, by which time they should be well equipped to make their own lifestyle choices.

The key word then is EDUCATION. The good news is that it doesn't have to be rigid and boring and it doesn't have to cost a penny, learning can most definitely be fun. For adults, finding out about healthy eating for the first time really can be enlightening; discovering new foods, improving  cooking skills and even dabbling in a bit of science in terms of how our bodies process certain foods can be fascinating, really it can!

A good place to start is to look at foods that are current favourites, the foods that are regularly served at the dinner table so to speak; look at the amounts of fat, carbohydrate, protein, fibre and the calorific value, most pre-packed foods are now clearly labelled to show their composition. By visiting a practising nutritionist or by spending a little time browsing online anyone can find out their recommended daily intake, this does vary by gender, age and activity level but it isn't difficult to work out how much you actually are and should be eating. Of course it is not just about the quantity, the quality of food is equally as important.

Once the current diet has been evaluated it is time to start eliminating, introducing and replacing:

ELIMINATE anything that is highly refined and processed, by that I mean food that is ready-prepared and made in a factory; these foods are generally high in sugar, hydrogenated fat, preservatives, additives and other ‘nasties’. Check labels, if it contains anything you haven't heard of or that sounds like a chemical rather than an ingredient then it probably isn't for eating. Another point worth mentioning is that if a child becomes accustomed to eating high-sugar foods and sweet desserts then it is more likely that they will develop a ‘sweet tooth’ in later life.

INTRODUCE fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and grains/pulses. These are ingredients, they are things to make a meal from; the fruit and vegetables should resemble what it says on the label and the meat/fish should be just that, nothing added. When preparing a meal introduce herbs and spices instead of sugar, salt and artificial flavourings.

REPLACE anything that would be considered ‘borderline’, for example:
•	Replace fried chips (or fries) with home-made skin-on baked potato wedges
•	Replace white bread (which has virtually no nutritional value) with wholemeal or seeded
•	Replace white rice and pasta with brown or wild rice and wholemeal pasta
•	Replace cakes and biscuits with pieces of fresh fruit and fruit salads
•	Replace shop-bought processed burgers with home-made, even try making them with turkey

These are of course just a few guidelines for transforming an unhealthy diet into one that is balanced and nutritious; if this seems like a complete diet overhaul then I would probably say that at least some changes are mandatory but it will most definitely be worth it. It probably also seems that a healthy diet requires far more work in terms of preparation and cooking, yes that is true and it is also one of the reasons why we as a nation are hooked on convenience foods and are in this dire situation; many of us have simply become lazy. It all comes down to choices, but it is the choice of the parent, not the child; the parent has an obligation to choose not to put their child at risk of developing health problems.

Once a parent starts gaining confidence in their own knowledge and the changes are being noticed at meal times then it's time to start involving the children and although it is a case of ‘the earlier the better’, it's never too late. Children can be fussy, granted, especially toddlers but parents should be patient. Trying new foods should be encouraged although it is important not to force new foods upon children if they genuinely don't like it as that will only create a negative association. Involving children in the whole process, from planning the meals, going to the shops and then preparing and cooking the food helps to get children interested in what they are eating rather than just presenting them with a plate of ‘something' and promising them a packet of sweets if they eat it!

There is no quick fix unfortunately; changing eating habits, as with any other habit, requires time, patience and perseverance. A good healthy diet is absolutely paramount in ensuring children have everything they need to grow and learn; it is scientifically proven that children with a less nutritious diet have more problems with concentration and don't perform as well academically. Again, this is entirely down to the parents, other than in extenuating circumstances I can see no excuse why children, particularly younger children, should have weight or nutrition issues. It is true that most people are on budgets and do have busy lifestyles but so much of it comes down to nothing more than prioritising and being organised; an overweight child is far more likely to become an overweight teenager... and then an overweight adult.

The potential physical health problems of being overweight are far too many to mention but range in seriousness from lethargy to cancer, not to mention the mental effects. The issue of childhood obesity in the UK has reached such a level that if it doesn't improve there will be serious implications for the Health Service in the future. This is a problem that needs to be addressed without delay and for anyone who is directly affected, there is no time like the present; help, support and guidance is available but no-one can provide the commitment required; that being said, the desire to give a child the best possible start in life should be enough to give all the commitment needed.

“Low” and “high” carbohydrate diets increase mortality.

I'm just transferring to a 4 year school, and I'm planning on talking to my future professors about the questions I have, but I figured it would also be good to ask questions to others in the field who aren't teaching. Also note that I have also called and talked to rdn's in my local area about the field. I'm turning to reddit because 1) why not give it a shot, and 2) I want to get all the info I can.

Some background about me: one of the many things that initially drew me specifically into nutrition (aside from my love of science and changing the world ect) was that there's so many things I can do with the degree (writing books, being an rdn, a professor, researcher, community nutrition, even law ect), so that if i get bored of one job, I can always do something else. As of right now, I want to do either research for my career, be an rdn, and or a professor. Anyways, here's my questions:

1) rdn's of reddit, how competitive is it to become an rdn? At my orientation, one of the advisors really stressed how competitive it is to get an internship, but didn't really elaborate on it other than you need a great gpa and extracurriculars (i have a good gpa-a 4.0 rn, and I'm currently trying to get involved in undergrad research, and I'm excited to get into it) I'm scared I won't be cut out for the internship process, as I'm not competitive. When I do something I'm passionate about, I do it because I love it, not to be better than the next guy (iow: competition doesn't motivate me). 

2) For those who have gotten their grad degrees, or are currently working on them, what was your game plan for grad school? To word that question another way, how did you plan on affording the cost of it, and are you/did you work while completing it? One of my plans is to work as an rdn for a while after I graduate so that I can save up for grad school. Is this plan feasible?

3) What is the best and worst thing about your career, day to day routine, and are you happy with your salary? 

4) If there's anything you would do over with regards to your college career and or professional career, what is it?

5) what do you love about the field and hate about it?

Northern swedish / Icelandic probiotic Fil Milk,"I posted this as a comment to another post here but figured it would be good as a stand alone discussion topic. 

There is some extremely interesting probiotic yoghurtmilk products called ""Fil"" from northern sweden.

""Hälsofil"" (Loosely translates to Healthy yoghurtmilk)

Its even listed as nature derived medicine by swedish law and can be prescribed for certain issues

Unfortunately the website is only in swedish but you can use google translate to look around in it:

[The Verum producers dairy organisations main site](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fverum.se%2Fprodukter%2F&amp;edit-text=)

What I've noticed since swapping out a litre of milk a day to a litre of healthy yoghurtmilk is that my hunger pangs has lessened and I just feel less stressed.

Digestion improved too. But my shits are a little uncomfortably brightly coloured compared to usual.

If you live in USA or the EU there are some swedish specialist stores that let you try it out

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars

The best part of ""fil"" is that you can make your own once you got a first pack. Just follow this recipy:

How to: swedish ""Fil"" milk

BUY ""YMP"" - Purchase buy a packet of filmjölk (Like verum hälsofil / a-fil / Långfil) of a natural (nonflavoured) type that you like and that contains live bacterial culture. It will be used as a seed to grow the beneficial bacteria strain from it and thus get the right taste and texture on your ""fil"" milk. You only use a little bit of it each time you make a batch of Fil milk, so the package will last for a long time. Freeze the excess divided into small air tight packages, then you have new starter if you end up needing it. You can use any pasteurized milk you want, but it will be best with a fatter variant (eg standard 4% fat milk).

Heat the regular milk first. Heat until it is almost boiling. You should see small bubbles in the saucepan, but it should not boil. The heating will kill all unwanted bacteria so that the good bacteria can get the upper hand. If you use pasteurized buttermilk and clean tools, you can skip step this step.

MIX IN THE YMP - Let the milk to cool to room temperature. Then mix in a little starter fil milk/YMP. Some tablespoons of it per liter of milk are usually good.

LET IT REST - Let the mixture stand at room temperature overnight (or until it is ready).

STORE COLD - Keep it in the refrigerator when it is ready, otherwise it will continue to ferment and become alcoholic. Totally worth it though but kinda tricky to get the right alcoholic content. If the ready-made ""fil"" milk tastes or smells bad then you should not eat it. In that case, it will be bad and you will have to throw it out and restart with a fresh batch.

SAVE SMALL BATCHES - Once you have eaten almost the entire film milk, you save only one slice that you use as grafting on the next rate (instead of using bacon milk). You can continue to grab the last sludge for any length of time, so you do not have to start over again with buying new ""Fil"" milk/YMP.

Ymp is just a swedish name for the piece of the ""Fil"" milk that you save to make new Fil milk with.

As for evidence there is some swedish research on it but I'm unfamiliar with the particulars. I can dig it up or get some email/phone numbers for you if youre interested.

You can always email the verum folks over here if youre interested in more recipies or starter packs or whatever else: forum@norrmejerier.se

Theres more contact info over here: https://verum.se/kontakt/

If you want to try this then I think A-fil and Långfil are the easiest to do it with. Verum Hälsofil can be done but it contains so many billions of bacteria per dl that it tend to grow rather quickly so you need to keep a closer eye on it.

For the sake of not introducing bad bacteria I would stick to using small frozen packets of the initial Fil milk. Make sure they are air tight and has as little air in the bag as possible. Then put the bags collected in an airtight container.

If nothing else you'll have an interesting special dish to take out when you're hungover or got visitors.

Can sensitivity to added sugars increase?,"I havent had any foods high in refined or added sugars in about 4 months. Yesterday and before yesterday I a waffer bar and a birthday cake respectively. Both days about 30-45 mins after eating them I felt my heart racing even though I was sitting at my desk or laying down. 

I know that sugar can accelerate the metabolism and increase heart rate but this was quite intense for me. Either I’m more aware of my heart rate or I’m having heart issues or I’m sensitive to high amounts of refined sugars now? 

Genuinely curious because no other foods do this to me. I usually have a banana (1) strawberry (5-6) blueberry (10-12) smoothie with walnuts and almonds for breakfast and sometimes for late night snack. And that being high in sugar has never done anything similar to me.

The Lancet Public Health Report: Thoughts?,"[Here is the study I am talking about](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext)

I've heard people use this to say that both low-carb and high-carb diets are less healthy than a moderate carb diet. [Statistics](https://imgur.com/a/WONoMAf).

The study also found that people who consumed animal-based fats had higher mortality than those who consumed plant-based fats

So here's what I take from it:

1. Although the mortality rates had a U-shaped association, the highest hazard level in the high-carb diets was about the lowest on the low-carb diet. [Here's what I mean](https://imgur.com/a/3JyZiVm).

2. While a high-carb diet might lead to higher mortality than a moderate-carb diet, eating plant-based fats led to a decrease in mortality.

Discussion on carbohydrate oxidation and questions,"There has been some disparate claims that the combination of glycogen and frucose (or sucrose) has no difference in muscle glycogen synthesis after consuming post-workout than simply glycogen (Willis et al.). However, this more recent study contradicts that and was published in 2017: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409683/

-

Even if one uses the glucose+fructose method which oxidizes up to 90g carbs/hour (as opposed to 60g carbs/hour for straight glucose and 30g of carbs/hour for straight fructose), the human body can only hold about ~500g of glycogen at a time (~100g in the liver and ~400g in the muscles). 

-

If you break down glycogen which is 3 to 4 parts water, then the carbs or glucose someone can hold is about ~145g. Let's round to 150g for ease of math. For someone cutting their body weight optimally, on workout days, they should consume no more than 150g of carbs (of which ~100g will be glucose and ~50g will be fructose) and drinking 4x water (possibly up to 5-6x) to recover?

Is it realistic to eat under 100 grams of sugar while eating huge amounts of carbs?

Eating all those carbs in rice and beans would be impossible because they are not very calorie dense like pasta is. Few people have the time to spend two hours eating each night.

Eating higher fats and lower carbs is not an option either because to eat any more fat would require eating from unhealthy fat sources due to fiscal reasons. (Ovacados ain't cheap)

Effect of Dietary Carbohydrate on Triglyceride Metabolism in Humans [Research Paper],"[https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/10/2772S/4686463](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/131/10/2772S/4686463)

The question is often raised here whether or not the body makes fat out of excessive carbohydrates and I certainly wondered if that somehow is why the increased carbohydrate consumption post 1970s has driven the diabesity epidemic.  Repeatedly studies have shown the body generally does not use de  novo lipgenesis unless it really has to.  Yet high blood triglycerides -- a fatty acid -- are a common issue with people on high-carb/low-fat diets, and is perhaps a driver in CVD.  

""A carbohydrate-induced effect on fasting TG concentration has been  established over the past four decades, and it is now clear that the  concentrations of both very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and  chylomicrons are elevated in the fasting state. The effect of  carbohydrate feeding to increase TG concentrations in the postprandial  state has become more evident recently. A postprandial study of eight  postmenopausal women making graded changes to reduce dietary fat intake  and increase carbohydrate intake showed sequential elevations in fasting  TG concentration as dietary carbohydrate was increased from 50% to 67%  of energy (7, 8).  Fasting TG concentration rose from 1.8 mmol/L on the ad libitum 50%  carbohydrate diet to 2.3 mmol/L on the 67% carbohydrate diet.""

Apparently, from the parent article ""The primary phenomenon of carbohydrate-induced HPTG could be explained by a 37% reduction in TG clearance from the blood.""

Eating carbohydrates, particular ones with a high GI, results in the body keeping fat in the blood!  So the overall body state has even the next day, higher fasting LIPIDS in the blood no matter how low-fat the meal was.

These then are a risk factor for CVD.  ""At baseline, triglyceride levels in fasting as well as nonfasting women  correlated with traditional cardiac risk factors and markers of insulin  resistance. During a median follow-up of 11.4 years, 1001 participants  experienced an incident cardiovascular event (including 276 nonfatal  myocardial infarctions, 265 ischemic strokes, 628 coronary  revascularizations, and 163 cardiovascular deaths), for an overall rate  of 3.46 cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years of follow-up. After  adjusting for age, blood pressure, smoking, and use of hormone therapy,  both fasting and nonfasting triglyceride levels predicted cardiovascular  events.""

On that New Lancet Study Claiming Low Carbohydate Diets Increase the Risk of Death,"I wanted to discuss that new nutritional epidemiological study recently [published in The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext#tbl1). I noticed a few people asking about it, so I wanted to share.   


Results: People who eat high-carbohydrate diets, or low-carbohydrate diets were at higher risk for mortality than people who ate a moderate amount of carbohydrates (50-55% of their caloric intake) 

General takeaways:

* The study used the noisy instrument known as the Food Frequency Questionnaire to figure out what participants ate. The problem with this form of measuring the exposures (food) is that it's subject to recall bias, is highly subjective and [violates measurement theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435617313756). In summary, it's not a very good way to figure out what people ate, so we can't be certain what people say they're eating is what they're actually eating. We haven't come up with better approaches to figure out what people ate in these types of studies. 
* Because this wasn't a randomized controlled trial, where you randomly assign people to a control group and an intervention group, you can't balance out other factors (confounders) that could be contributing to the outcomes. Typically you do statistical adjustments for these covariates in these types of observational studies, some of which were smoking, income level, physical activity during leisure time, etc, but the problem is that there are multiple ways to include all these covariates in a statistical model. Every combination of covariates will give slightly different results. With 8 covariates, you can get nearly 8,000 statistical models. The authors included several covariates in their models but only reported two statistical models. A better approach is to [explore all possible models](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279400) and report the median results of all possible models.
* Most of the participants who were eating low-carbohydrate diets also ate less fruits, less vegetables, less dietary fiber, while those who were eating high-carbohydrate diets were eating refined carbohydrates. 
* The number of participants eating low-carbohydrate was much smaller than the number of participants eating moderate carbohydrate. This can be seen in the confidence intervals (which were very wide) indicating large amounts of uncertainty. With small sample sizes you get a lot more variability and uncertainty in your average estimate. 

All the study really told us is that people who eat lesss fruits and vegetables were at higher risk for mortality, and that's if we assume with good faith that we have an accurate representation of what these participants ate. We don't, unfortunately. ",nutrition,1534819703,Zaddit,1,1,True,2018-08-20

In summary, it's not a very good way to figure out what people ate, so we can't be certain what people say they're eating is what they're actually eating. We haven't come up with better approaches to figure out what people ate in these types of studies.

Because this wasn't a randomized controlled trial, where you randomly assign people to a control group and an intervention group, you can't balance out other factors (confounders) that could be contributing to the outcomes. Typically you do statistical adjustments for these covariates in these types of observational studies, some of which were smoking, income level, physical activity during leisure time, etc, but the problem is that there are multiple ways to include all these covariates in a statistical model. Every combination of covariates will give slightly different results. With 8 covariates, you can get nearly 8,000 statistical models. The authors included several covariates in their models but only reported two statistical models. A better approach is to [explore all possible models](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26279400) and report the median results of all possible models.

Most of the participants who were eating low-carbohydrate diets also ate less fruits, less vegetables, less dietary fiber, while those who were eating high-carbohydrate diets were eating refined carbohydrates.

The number of participants eating low-carbohydrate was much smaller than the number of participants eating moderate carbohydrate. This can be seen in the confidence intervals (which were very wide) indicating large amounts of uncertainty. With small sample sizes you get a lot more variability and uncertainty in your average estimate.

All the study really told us is that people who ate less fruits and vegetables were at higher risk for mortality, and that's if we assume with good faith that we have an accurate representation of what these participants ate. We don't, unfortunately.",nutrition,1534820331,Zaddit,28,64,True,2018-08-20
Can you guys help me evaluate this study on low-carb diets?,"This is an article about the study: https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2018/08/17/low-carb-diet-bad/. 

This is the study itself: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext. 

This is what my nutritionist (who has me on a ""keto"" diet for weight-loss) said: 

&gt;Someone else had actually sent me that article, though from the cbc. Here is I think all that is required to read of it, excerpted from the cbc site.

&gt;""The data studied by the researchers came from dietary questionnaires completed by participants who had enrolled in a cardiovascular risk factors study between 1987 and 1989 in four American communities. They had several follow-up interviews over approximately 25 years to monitor their self-reported food intake.
The authors attempted to control many variables that could affect the results, but acknowledge the limitations of the study, including the fact that it was not a randomized trial.  The results show an association between both low- and high-carb diets and increased risk of death, but can't conclude cause and effect.""

&gt;Any studies conclusion are worthless if they are not drawing from sound data. Self reported nutritional surveys are worthless as a data input in my opinion and the author of this study seems to agree in this case. That said, I clearly have a horse in this race, so continuing to look at things that give an anti-ketogenic diet sentiment is definitely worthwhile.

My nutritionist also commented: 

&gt;Any form of self reported data is going to be of low quality. I have weighed countless portions for our service and design macro portioned meals each week. Yet I have no clue what the macro breakdown of any meal I eat that isn't produced by [my company] is. People are just bad at observing/reporting that kind of data. Without a digital scale at each meal it is really is unreliable data. So not really that I think people are lying, just ignorant and being forced to report something regardless of not knowing.

I’m not losing any weight, but I am getting faster, more endurance. What does this mean?

2. Could I be cheating myself? As far as I can tell, work ethic is tip top in both strength AND conditioning. But I’m wondering if somehow I’m not putting the effort in.

Q about psyllium husk and nutrition absorption?,"So, word on the grape vine is that psyllium husk interferes with nutrient absorption. I haven't bothered to research this in-depth but judging by the way psyllium goops up when it absorbs water, I can imagine it would make it more difficult to absorb nutrients.

I have two questions about this, though.

First, is it TRUE? I mean, by the time the psyllium comes out the other end, it looks the same as everything else I've eaten. Is the fiber actually capable of absorbing nutrients on its own and thus preventing the body from digesting them?

That's my preliminary question. If it is true, then my real question is: would you be able to use psyllium to offset the health risks of unhealthy food?

I'm not saying I'm going to start gobbling psyllium husks as an excuse to go shove handfuls of Big Macs down my throat. But for the sake of the question, let's use that as an example. If psyllium can prevent nutrients from being absorbed properly, wouldn't that effectively mean that you could take some psyllium as a buffer before eating something unhealthy (i.e. a Big Mac) so the psyllium absorbs all the crap instead of your body?

I know already that psyllium seriously hinders the absorption of supplements and drugs, but I'm unsure as to whether it actually prevents any of the substance from being absorbed or just causes it do be absorbed slower. 

Any thoughts? I can see a lot of potential applications here. Took one shot too many at the bar? Quick - gobble some psyllium. Ate something rotten or infected? Gobble some psyllium to absorb the dangers before seeking further help. A friend offers you a meal that doesn't fit with your dietary restrictions, but you don't want to refuse their caring offers?

"The ""indigestible food swallowing"" diet (Armonk Diet)","Hello everyone,

I know this is a bad idea, but could someone clue me in as to exactly how bad an idea this is?

**Background:** this is a YouTube video that's being promoted but ratings/comments have been disabled and I can't find a single piece of writing about the concepts online.

**Concept**: swallow indigestible fiber (sweetcorn as an example) whole to fill the stomach before consuming meals to promote portion control. The undigested food passes through the body without being used for energy.

On one hand at home you still eat the same amount of fat and other stuff, but on the other you avoid lengthy lists of added preservatives and so, you have more variety (today burger with tomatoes, tomorrow with a cucumber) and you control sugar intake (home-made pastry seems to have nowhere as much sugar).

Nutrition for hand tendons / ligaments repair and healing ?,"hey guys...
i want to make this short and easy to read :) I experienced a strong lightning pain between two fingers in my hand in March 2017 while work and being in lots of stress. It felt like a tendon rupture or something like that. Also my whole forearm and hand was suffering from lots of pain from inflammation at that time - I was not able to use the mouse with my right hand anymore and had to switch to left hand for some time.I probably caused this by too much and heavy typing, stressful IT job with nightshift and iphone use.
Now, 18months later it got better, I can use my right hand again for work and in terms of inflammation pain got less, however i still cannot do pushups or bend my wrist without having lot of pain in my right back of the hand. So only specific movements like bending the wrist is causing pain.
I recently changed my diet to cut out meat since i want cut out inflammation causing foods. Is there any nutrition or studies about what to eat to improve and support hand tendon repair?",nutrition,1535017548,seolein,2,2,True,2018-08-23

"Omega 6 fatty acids are not inflammatory, but saturated fats are",[removed],nutrition,1535035519,PerO223,1,1,True,2018-08-23
"Omega 6 fatty acids are not inflammatory, but saturated fats are","
I see people claiming quite frequently that n-6s are inflammatory but a systematic review found just the opposite. It also found saturated fats are inflammatory and omega 3s are less anti inflammatory than once thought requiring pharmacological doses (dietary amounts aren’t enough).

I have also seen a few people claim LDL doesn’t cause heart disease but rather inflammation causes the LDL to cause heart disease. Considering saturated fats raise LDL and induce inflammation, is it fair to say saturated fats contribute to heart disease? Would love to hear thoughts on this and the review in general.

“Three key fatty acid–inflammation interactions are briefly described. First, the evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids induce inflammation in part by mimicking the actions of LPS. Second, the often-repeated claim that dietary linoleic acid promotes inflammation was not supported in a recent systematic review of the evidence. Third, an explanation is offered for why omega-3 (n–3) polyunsaturated fatty acids are so much less anti-inflammatory in humans than in mice. The article closes with a cautionary tale from the genomic literature that illustrates why extrapolating the results from inflammation studies in mice to humans is problematic.”

“However, a few members of the lipid research community have expressed concerned that LA-rich diets are unhealthy and promote inflammation (41, 42). The theoretical basis for this concern over LA’s proinflammatory actions involve a number of putative interrelated metabolic processes, including the following: 1) dietary LA promoting tissue arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n−6, eicosatetraenoic acid) accumulation, 2) enhanced synthesis of proinflammatory eicosanoids derived from AA, 3) reduced conversion of α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n−3, octadecatrienoic acid) into EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid; 20:5n–3) and/or DHA, and 4) diminished synthesis of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids from EPA and DHA. The experimental evidence supporting each step of this paradigm originated primarily from rodent and cell culture studies. More recently, and in contrast with the multistep process described above, it was suggested that various oxidized forms of LA are directly responsible for stimulating inflammation (43).”

“Fortunately, the first evidence-based review of all the human clinical data available that addressed the impact of dietary LA on inflammation in healthy adults was recently published (44). Fifteen studies (8 parallel and 7 crossover) met the inclusion criteria. The most important inclusion criterion was that the only FA other than LA that was allowed to differ substantially between the experimental and control dietary interventions was oleic acid. The reason for this was the existing evidence that suggested that oleic acid had no impact on inflammation (45). In contrast, it is believed that SFAs promote and n–3 PUFAs reduce inflammation; thus, simultaneous changes in the intake of those FAs along with LA could confound interpretation of the results. Heterogeneity between these studies prevented meta-analysis. Regardless of this limitation, not one of the studies reported a significant positive association between LA intake and circulating concentrations for a wide variety of inflammatory markers. More often than not, higher LA intake was associated with lower, not higher, inflammatory status in healthy adults. In addition, the results from a randomized controlled trial, which was completed and published after the systematic review, indicated that increasing LA intake from 4% to 13% of energy improved (i.e., diminished) biomarkers of inflammation in obese subjects (46). Not surprisingly, those subjects consuming extra SFAs from butter showed elevations in plasma markers of inflammation”",nutrition,1535038109,Only8livesleft,73,2,True,2018-08-23

"How and why does dieting, specifically very low cal dieting cause muscle loss?","I hear this a heluva lot everywhere. You will lose muscle when losing weight. Why? it makes far more sense for the body to use up glycogen, then fat, THEN muscle when needing energy resources, so why do so many places even claim that the weight loss if not super high protein and coupled with weight training that your body will just look at the muscle you have and go ""nah, you're not needed"".

I get that less calories could cause maybe a slight dip in muscle mass, more because if it just plain isn't being used, the body has no reason to retain it. If this is true, which I think it is, but plenty of people hyperbole it to heck and back, how much do you usually lose?  


I've personally been on a 1000-1100 calorie diet, with very few days being around 1300 or so and a cheat day of not caring 1-2 times a month and I've lost 20 pounds or 10.8 kilos since June 18th.

Balancing nutrition for a soft mechanical diet without sacrificing taste.

Vitamin d and magnesium deficiency,"Hello everyone i’ a 22 year old male and my medical history for the past year has been a lot confusing so here it goes:

I endured chest pain along with muscle spasms all over accompanied by severe anxoett and panic attacks for 4 months before my dermatologist told me i was vit d deficient at only 14 ng/ml. I then started 300.000 ius for 2 times with 15 day differences and i also took another one after around a month so basically i consumed 1 million ius of vit d in around a month and a half then my symptoms which had initially been wiped out came back. I was then found to be magnesium deficient and have relatively low bmd around the osteopenic range i also had low pth and low alp levels and below is a specific list of symptoms and reliefs i found when supplementing and eating various micronutrients:

Magnesium lowers my heart rate makes me a lot less anxious and relieves most of my pain and tenseness only problem i saw was a pins and needles kind of feeling around my upper abdomen and chest along woth occasional pain around there but could be a longer term problem with hypomagnesemia dont know if it’s related

Calcium makes my heartrate go up and causes anxiety and panic along with pounding heartbeat causes pain all over also aggravates pain around left chest and seems to make my joints feel achy it also causes muscle twitching and hyper activations of the muscles they also seem a lot tenser when i drink a glass of milk.

Zinc cures my lower back pain but could be depleting my magnesium or at least making it fulfill a lot longer could be beneficial for overall bone health but might have to take less than what i currently take which is 50mg every two days.

Copper is a no go for me as liver contains copper and seems to make me anxious and cause lower back pain as it depletes zinc

Vitamin b of all kind could be beneficial and i have not seen any side effects but have been feeling generally better when i took them, dosage could be a problem though.

Vitamin d, my initial savior, i probably overdosed on it and didn’t take enough cofactors as my levels hit 88 ng/ml at one point but taking it was instantly beneficial to me back in the time. I could be deficient or might need to take my levels higher than 50 but don’t want to take it unless instructed otherwise. My pain has been chronically worse in nights so could be a sign i still might not have enough of either this or cofactors.

My alp levels have been chronically low and probably the cause why calcium causes problems for me. could indicate hypopwhosphatasia or low cofactors cod liver oil is my best bet to get them back up though along with magnesium.

Pth levels seems to have increased from 9 ng/ml to 25 ng/ml after a week or so of taking magnesium and zinc.

Any feedback on whether i did something wrong like not consuming enough magnesium or a specific health condition that could be the cause is highly appreciated. Thanks.",nutrition,1535074383,hueaq123,2,1,True,2018-08-23

So, as the title said, I just signed up for school after a long time away and decided to do Nutrition. Here is some context behind the choice ( the goal being that you, after reading this, may realize there me be a better field of study for me that I'm currently unaware of):

I've always been interested in Biology. I was a terrible student in school but always got B's in Biology class. As I got older, I started to lift and really enjoyed it. Naturally, diet became another interest. As years went on and I began to expand my horizons, I discovered people like Dr. Rohnda Patrick (thanks Joe Rogan) and found that I was deeply interested in the material she was involved in. I also became deeply interested in Psychology and Neuroscinece. Are you seeing a trend? All of this has something to do with the Human mind or body. 
Fast forward to a few weeks ago when signing up for school. I tell me advisor "" I'm thinking either nutrition, personal training, or biology"" (I left out psychology as I've come to learn its currently an oversaturatwd field).
My advisor hands me two sheets for each Associates track. One for nutrition (Associate of Art for some reason) and on for biology (Associate of Science). Now, I am abysmal at math. Always have been. The AS has a ton of math. Some I've never even seen before (I literally never got past pre-algebra but actually didn't do too bad in Geometry). The AA I would only need to take a single math class for the rest of my academic career. The choice seems obvious, but I don't want to regret this decision. I'm willing to work hard and put the time to learn in, but it also may be an uphill battle I could easily avoid. 

Thanks for your patience reading through this and any advice you may have 🙏",nutrition,1535122730,thothpethific92,4,1,True,2018-08-24
Do we focus too much on smaller details when it comes to nutrition?,"I read this sub frequently and see a lot of similar posts - people focusing on tiny aspects of nutrition and diet. But do we pay too much attention to refining diet when there are so many other factors that affect our health?

Unless you have a completely stress free life, sleep perfectly for 8+ hours a day, live in a completely safe and hygenic world and work in a completely safe environment, there are far too many factors - bigger factors that will affect your overall health and longevity than simply what type of sweetener is ""healthier"" or whether farmed salmon is worse than wild caught salmon.

Sure, there may be trivial benefits of one thing over another, but that 1% lower risk you have of developing bowel/colon cancer due to avoiding processed meats and eating only grass fed meat is only going to benefit you if every other aspect of your environment and life is completely, 100% perfect.

Stress and the risks of every day life have a huge say on our general overall health and risk of developing disease or our risk of death overall.

A maintenece worker who works on roadworks on a motorway/highway every day of his life has a much higher risk of health issues caused by a potential injury than whether he eats bacon or not every day.

I think some people (including myself) are guilty of taking things too far and losing perspective. We all need to take a step back and look at what really matters. 

Sure, you might gain an extra 2, 3, 4, 5+ years by eating a certain way or avoiding certain foods, but you could also die from a car accident tommorow or die from a brain aneurysm or a multitude of other causes outside of your control.

I also think, our younger years are for living. We don't live forever, and most people will die of natural causes/disease between the ages of 50 and 100. Much of it is down to genetics, environment and pure luck. If you don't die of CVD/atherosclerosis, you might die of cancer and vice versa. Enjoy life while your body is still capable of most things, and don't stress or worry/think too much about the finer details.",nutrition,1535123457,bachus2015,18,28,True,2018-08-24

Feeling noticeably tired during sprints when eating less,"My philosophy is I eat as close to natural state as I possibly can (ie as many fruits and veggies as possible) I was aiming for 2000 calories a day, which is a lot and hard to hit sticking to my rules. but Ive stopped losing weight the last few months, but I want to buy back in on eating less calories a day (1200) so I can start losing weight again.

My dad and I got into a heated health argument.,"I'm a 16 you're old male who has gotten a lot of criticism from my parents because of my food choices. So, just yestardy my mother made beef for dinner but since I'm not a big fan of red meat I only got a little bit of beef and for extra protien I've opened up a can of chicken. (I understand that canned food isn't the best option) but personaly I don't not see anything wrong with that, long term since the beef we were eating for dinner was grain feed, so probably not that much healthier. My dad looked at me in disapproval and started judging me. He said that the chicken has harmeful hormons. I understand this is probably true but chicken just taste so much better to me. I try to make the best health options that I can considering my limitations. For example instead of drinking black coffee with sugar, I use honey instead. Back to my dad, over the years he have judged me for choosing to eat chicken, fish or eggs instead of beef. I think the reason for this might be because eating red meat is seen as more masculine (he believes in stereotypes) but yesterday I had enough of it. Keep in mind that every week he eats things like: hot pockets, refined sugar, white bread ect. Littarly last week he ate shark meat and even encouraged me to eat it as well even though it has high levels of mercury. Anyways after he told me that I shouldn't be eatjng the canned chicken due to the hormones in it, I snapped at him and said: why do hell do you care what goes into my mouth!!! We've littarly gotton into a heated agrument for 5 straight minutes. Today he is coming back from work and is expectimg me to apologize.

Soda makes my skin dry and itchy?,"Hopefully this is the right place to ask this (apologies if not).

I’ve had issues with dry and itchy skin for a while now. I’ve noticed that after I drink soda it’s worse. At first I thought it was the caffeine, but even if I drink Sprite with no caffeine my skin feels noticeably more dry and itchy afterwards. So what is it about the soda? Can sugar cause dry skin? My other thought is it could be from the carbonation...I have IBS and my stomach is pretty sensitive to just about everything so maybe that’s somehow related. If I drink a soda and then go for a walk in the sun, the sun is uncomfortable on my dry skin and I’m more itchy. Taking a shower also makes my skin more dry and itchy after drinking it. If I don’t drink soda my skin feels better.

If you arent familiar, olive garden runs this promotion every year. If you purchase a $100 (plus tax) pass, you can eat soup/salad/bread and as many endless pasta bowls (with sauce/protein choice) as you want for 8 consecutive weeks.

I'm currently 26, live within 15 minutes of a OG and weigh 170lbs. I wrestle 5 nights a week and have looked to start a new strength lifting program. Part of the reasoning for this diet is to support recovery and growth. The other part is because I'm a broke student.

I'm posting here in order to see what I should take as nutritional precautions. Obviously the sodium-so tons of water and potassium.

"Probiotics can help men of all ages improve digestion, heart health, immune system and even sex life."," 

Some common questions I get asked about probiotics are:

* When should I take probiotics?
* How many probiotics should I take?
* What brands are the best probiotics for men?
* What are the benefits of probiotics for men?
* How does bodybuilding fit with probiotics?
* Do I need probiotics to build muscle and get a lean, shredded physique?

In this post, I'm going to answer these questions and talk about the benefits of probiotics for men in greater detail. Bookmark this page, share with your friends and feel free to ask any questions in the comments below. 

Let's get started!

## WHAT ARE PROBIOTICS?

So what exactly are probiotics?

Let's take a look:

Probiotics are a type of bacteria, which is usually associated with nasty germs that surround us and make us sick. While this is true, it does not apply to all bacteria. We have millions and billions of bacteria in our body. Some of them protect us and some of them harm us. Probiotics belong to the first group, they are the good guys.

As the name itself suggests, probiotics “support” life, pro-for and bio-life. As the World Health organization defines them, “probiotics are live organisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.” Probiotics are live bacteria and yeast that are beneficial for health and particularly digestive system. 

In the course of our lives, we all use up bacteria, and some of them are so essential for life that they need to be replaced. That is when probiotics come to rescue. Probiotics are also good at keeping the balance between good and bad bacteria to make sure the bad ones don’t exceed and result in any health issue. Probiotics are best friends with our guts, that’s why they are good for men who are trying to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Probiotics work on the nerves that control gut movement, so the food reaches gut quickly. Besides, probiotics can also improve immune system, support a weight management program and prevent diseases such as diarrhea. 

You can find probiotics food and supplements in the market. They come in a variety of forms and shapes like yogurt, cheese, kimchi or other dairy products. Each of them can have a different purpose because not all probiotics are the same, so check with a doctor what probiotic you need before purchasing any.

So, you can still enjoy breakfast comprised of yogurt with probiotics and in the meantime, take care of your body and your health. 

## BENEFITS OF PROBIOTICS FOR MEN 

Okay, probiotics for men are good but how do they benefit the body and help get into shape quicker?

Here are some of the top reasons to start taking probiotics.

### PROBIOTICS IMPROVE DIGESTION

To exercise everyone needs energy and the source of energy is food. To not go too deep into biology, let’s just say when the food we eat is not digested correctly, our body doesn’t have enough carbohydrates to break down and turn into energy. To support digestive system, use probiotics for men, and you’ll have a properly working gut and stomach.

Studies have shown that probiotics are successful in fighting inflammatory bowel diseases, ulcerative colitis, diarrhea as well as IBS symptoms. It’s a win-win, get energy for a more active workout and stay away from unpleasant diseases. 

### PROBIOTICS IMPROVE HEART HEALTH

If you started working out, then your trainer has already told you that you should monitor your heart rate because that’s the best way of ensuring that the fitness program is safe and appropriate for your body. Nothing is more horrible than doing cardio with an unhealthy heart, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Probiotics for men proved to be effective in lowering the LDL cholesterol and blood pressure. Using probiotics for men for around 8 weeks or more can have positive effects on your hearth and make it ready for intense workouts such as High Intensity Interval Training. 

And yes, probiotics can improve sex life, which has a huge amount of benefits for your body and mind.

### PROBIOTICS CREATE A STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM

You don’t want to hit the gym with fever and cough, but with a weak immune system, you’ll face it a lot. It’s been shown that probiotics for men create antibodies that fight harmful bacteria and maintain good health.

Probiotics for men manage to break down any bacteria, viruses or germs that get inside your body attached to food. So, these pathogens are not able to complete their evil mission.

Regularly taking probiotics for men can also reduce the risk of respiratory infections or at least make sure they do not last long. Probiotics for men boost the immune system 

### PROBIOTICS HELP WEIGHT LOSS

Finally, probiotics for men not only create favorable conditions to work out, but they also help you to burn fat and lose weight. Probiotics for men do not allow your body to absorb and store the dietary fat found in the intestine. Plus, if you use probiotics for men consistently, you will feel full longer and store less fat and burn more calories.

It is important to keep in mind that not all types of antibiotics for men assist in losing weight. So before choosing probiotic supplements and food, check with your health professional.

## PROBIOTICS FOR MEN 50 AND OLDER

So far, we have established that probiotics for men are good for health, they benefit the organism in many ways, and they are necessary for those who are trying to lose weight and exercise. We also know that probiotics for men are different and they all serve different purposes. Another critical factor to consider is the age.

&amp;#x200B;

Probiotics for men who are 25 may not work as well for a 45-year old. Younger men can take a variety of probiotics because they are more likely to benefit from all of them. But the older men get, the fewer mistakes and errors they can make. It’s important that they take the probiotic supplement that their body needs. A 50-year old should take exactly right probiotics for men for it to have the right effect. 

For example, Bifidobacterium strain called B. lactis Bl-04 is good for middle-aged men who are struggling with digestive issues and other side problems that are typical to their age group.

The selection is not limited to few, but it should be more careful and on point. The body much rather absorb probiotics for men, which is essential not merely beneficial. 

## WHAT ARE THE BEST PROBIOTIC BRANDS FOR MEN?

The market is full of probiotics for men, so many that they’ll confuse you. While there are many probiotics brands that men can use, these are some of the most popular that we recommend:

### ULTIMATE FLORA CRITICAL CARE

According to the Consumer Health Report, the Ultimate Flora Critical Care is one of the top-rated probiotics brands. They use proper and useful probiotic strains. Their products cover a variety of needs and purposes. The experience has shown that Ultimate Flora Critical Care probiotics for men are resilient and effective. 

### GARDEN OF LIFE RAW PROBIOTICS

Another one of the Consumer Health Report’s suggested brands. Garden of Life offers probiotics for men that have no additives or preservatives. It’s for the best to buy the Garden of Life RAW probiotics for men in smaller quantities but other than that there are no concerns or notes related to the brand. 

### CULTURELLE DIGESTIVE HEALTH PROBIOTIC

Even though they have only 1 strain in formula, which means they cover one issue only, Culturelle Digestive Health Probiotics for men contain no artificial ingredients, they are good for the digestion and boost the immune system. 

#### SHOULD MEN USE PROBIOTICS?

You can eat healthy your whole life, but without exercise, you won’t be able to stay fit and vice versa. You can do both, but it’ll still take a long time until you achieve the desired result. Probiotics are a great way to improve digestion, heart health, the immune system and overall health.

As smart as our bodies are, they need support from us to maintain balance and fight harmful bacteria, germs, yeast and break down food. 

For further details about how to include probiotics in your overall training, including dosage and other supplements to include, be sure to follow a proven training plan for men such as Shredded.

The advantage of following such a trusted program is that it allows men to not only know exactly when to take probiotics and what dosage, but how they should be used in conjunction with training, diet and other supplements in order to build muscle, burn fat and get leaner.

[Research Discussion] Changes in Household Diet: Determinants and Predictability,"**This research was conducted by:** 
 
Stefan Hut &amp; Emily Oster, Brown University.
 
 **This research was published by:** 
 
 The National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER - https://www.nber.org/papers/w24892  
 
 **Concluding quote(s) from:** 
 
&gt;This paper analyzes the determinants of changes in diet in a general population. We find,
first, that even in response to seemingly large treatments - for example, major disease diagnosis
- changes in diet are very limited. Research findings and changes in government policy
advice seem to have a similarly negligible role. There is little predictable heterogeneity. 

&gt;We find, however, that there is a small share of households who do show large improvements in diet over time. Using a machine learning model we predict who these households
are. We find that some components of baseline diet are successful predictors of behavior
change. Notably, households with a concentrated diet ex ante are more likely to improve
their diet. The patterns of dietary improvement suggest the changes in diet are also largely
concentrated in a small number of food groups.  

&gt;We argue for two broad conclusions. First, the fact that behavior change is so limited
even after such large events suggests that it may be a challenge to use education to change
behavior. This is consistent with a literature in economics and elsewhere showing that diets
are not especially malleable (e.g. Atkin, 2016). Second, the evidence in the final section
suggests that the data may be better fit with a model which takes into account households
limited ability to pay attention to changes. This model better fits the facts than a standard
neoclassical model, and suggests a focus on policy which targets a more limited number of
changes to one’s diet.",nutrition,1535317343,TrannyPornO,1,4,True,2018-08-26

Timeline of nutritional guidelines: How did we go from low carbs to low fat?,"I am reading a book called The Obesity Code by Jason Fung, MD and was really interested in the first chapter where it outlines how the US came to developing the Food Pyramid. Below is a summary:

 * In 1825 Jean Anthleme Brillat-Savarin wrote *The Physiology of Taste* saying we should avoid floury and starchy substances to loose weight. 
* In 1863 William Banting wrote the *Letter on Corpulence, Addresses to the Public* saying we should avoid sugary and starchy carbohydrates calling them &gt;fattening carbohydrates&gt;.
* In the 1900s Dr. Robert Hugh Rose wrote *Eat Your Way to Health* introducing calorie counting.
* In 1918, Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters wrote *Diet and Health, with Key to the Calories* which Herbert Hoover (then head of the FDA) used to advocate calorie counting
* In the 1950's as physicians were seeing an increase in heart disease so they began advocating for higher carb diets and lower fat, which is an oxymoron as you have to increase your carb macros to meet daily energy requirements.
* In 1972 John Yudkin wrote the book *Pure, White, and Deadly: How Sugar is Killing Us* ~ self-explanatory sugar is bad
* In 1977, Committe on Nutrition and Human Needs led by Senator George McGovern wrote the *Dietary Goals for the US* advocating for low fat diets, resulting in the infamous food pyramid.

Advice on transitioning from Keto To Balanced Diet?,"I'm currently two weeks into Keto, which is my second time since doing it for six weeks back in February. I think I'm succeeding at it far better this time around than I did on the previous try. I'm averaging 21 net carbs a day, and amazingly, I'm averaging 6g of sugar a day, as opposed to my average for 2+ years of 55-60g a day. Yeah... I'm pretty proud of how I've kicked sugar this way.

Details: 40 years old / 6'0"", 170 (down 5lbs in 2 weeks) body fat 18.9%. Lift weights 3x a week, ride my Peloton 2-3x a week, HIIT, Intervals, etc.

My goal this time around on Keto is to get rid of my abdominal fat, have a flatter stomach, and look better in my cycling gear. I expect that after 8 weeks I'll see how I am against those goals, and then transition out of Keto into a balanced diet.

Here's my question: What tips does anyone have for going back to a higher protein, lower fat, typical carb breakdown for percentages of each and macros within to help gain muscle, but to keep off the fat that was lost on Keto? Typically, even when not working out regularly, I target about 2,100 calories a day and feel just fine eating that way. When I get back to a balanced diet, I want to make the following easy: 1) stay energized through the right food choices. 2) don't overeat. 3) DO NOT crave sugar and stick to the good habits I'm now developing. 4) Avoid the carbs that will make me sluggish, tired, etc. 5) Eat the right things that aid in muscle maintenance. 5) 1 1/2 reasonable cheat days a week that I can trust won't destroy me when coupled with regular exercise and a good nutrition plan the rest of the week.

Long story short, at that point I see myself in much more of a continuous maintenance mode, keeping the fat off, eating lean, gaining muscle.

Following a Chinese/East Asian diet,"Nutrition is a tricky thing, so perhaps the easiest approach is to take the diet of an existing healthy population, and copy it. Given that, I've been lately following a Chinese diet. Now, it's important to bear in mind, this does not mean eating what you commonly find in your local takeaway (which is to Chinese food, what McDonalds is to Western food). However, given that China has very low rates of obesity, and it's 1st tier cities have some of the longest lifespans in the world(despite their pollution problems), they are clearly doing something right. I could imagine similar learning could be had from Japanese and Korean food, but I'm less experienced with them, and much of the same logic still applies.

Some key points I've observed:
1. Look to include variety rather then exclude variety. The Chinese diet is significantly more varied then the western diet, with double or triple the variety of vegetables, significantly more spices, and much larger variety of cuts of meats consumed. By design, an unbalanced diet is less likely.
2. Flavour vegetable dishes with meat eg by adding small quantities of stock or ground meat. This makes primarily vegetable dishes much more filling and psychologically fulfilling.
3. No desert course. Instead deserts are eaten as a seperate snack while out and about, as a treat. On balance less deserts are eaten in general.
4. Meals eaten ""family style"", with no individual portion other then rice. This means you eat until hungry, and there is no pressure to ""clean your plate"". When eating western food I often leave feeling stuffed, when eating Chinese food I am sated but not overly full.
5. Green tea (no milk) or soup are the drink of choice. If you're already drinking tap water with your main meal I don't see these adding much, but they are both clearly superior to soft drinks or fruit juices. So for the person drinking a coke with every meal, this is a clear win.

Interestingly, when I look at the properties of an East Asian diet (and it's success speaks for itself in terms of the general health of these countries) it seems to go against a lot of current trends in modern diets.

"22 male, frustratingly underweight, help?","Hey guys, 

So, as the title says, I am 22 years of age, male, roughly 5'8, and I am 114 pounds. Yes, you heard me correct. I eat like a normal person, in fact at times more so than my friends (roommates) - for example, none of them eat breakfast but I make absolute sure that I have 3 eggs, a large glass of milk, and cereal to start my day in the morning. I drink a lot of coffee, which I guess probably doesn't help, but who doesn't drink coffee? I have literally been stuck at this weight range now for years, and it seems like nothing has ever worked. It's just so frustrating, I hate being so skinny compared to my friends who are all at least 130 and yet I am at an unusual 114. I am skinny, I certainly do not look like I have an eating disorder or anything but I am thin for sure.

I'm really starting to think I have some underlying medical issue that has never been addressed, or maybe I just have an extremely high metabolism? Either way, it blows. Last semester I ate more than I ever had, always made sure that I included fish in my diet but that only marginally worked - I think the highest I have ever been at has been 118. Ridiculous.

Should I see a doctor about this? My parents will just say that I'm just making this all up in my head and I am a perfectly healthy 22 year old, but I do not understand how they could think 113 pounds is even close to ""healthy"" for a 22 year old.

Can someone here explain adaptive thermogenesis?,"Hi r/Nutrition, I’m here with a question on how adaptive thermogenesis works. I’ve got a fairly good understanding of what it is (I think), in that it’s your body curtailing calorie expenditure wherever it can during a prolonged calorie shortage, and that it can reduce its expenditures by something like 10% beyond what’s expected from weight loss alone.

My question though, is whether changing the distribution of calorie deficit over the course of a weight loss program without changing the overall deficit would have any effect to either promote or discourage this process. Say for example two people both run a calorie deficit of 3500kcal per week, but that one splits it up to 500 every day and the other only does two days of 1750.

Put another way, does calorie deficit distribution over the course of a week affect adaptive thermogenesis?",nutrition,1535558756,TypicalUser1,9,5,True,2018-08-29

The Global Influence of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Diet (study),"http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/9/9/251/htm


&gt;Abstract:

&gt;The emphasis on health ministry within the Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) movement led to the development of sanitariums in mid-nineteenth century America. These facilities, the most notable being in Battle Creek, Michigan, initiated the development of vegetarian foods, such as breakfast cereals and analogue meats. The SDA Church still operates a handful of food production facilities around the world. The first Battle Creek Sanitarium dietitian was co-founder of the American Dietetics Association which ultimately advocated a vegetarian diet. The SDA Church established hundreds of hospitals, colleges, and secondary schools and tens of thousands of churches around the world, all promoting a vegetarian diet. As part of the ‘health message,’ diet continues to be an important aspect of the church’s evangelistic efforts. In addition to promoting a vegetarian diet and abstinence from alcohol, the SDA church has also invested resources in demonstrating the health benefits of these practices through research. Much of that research has been conducted at Loma Linda University in southern California, where there have been three prospective cohort studies conducted over 50 years. The present study, Adventist Health Study-2, enrolled 96,194 Adventists throughout North America in 2003–2004 with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Adventist Health Studies have demonstrated that a vegetarian diet is associated with longer life and better health.

Food combinations?,"In the recent 4-5 months I made a drastic change to my diet. Nothing processed too much in regards to meats, only eat chicken breast or salmon. 

Always vegetables, either cooked or raw. Fruits and nuts as well. Very routine diet. Almost always the same thing every day with a few slip ups here and there, of dark chocolate and sometimes some cake or cookies. But no major refined carbs other than whole wheat pita bread. 

I lost a significant amount of weight as well because I was also jogging everyday for an 45min - 1h. 

I learned to love foods without oils, salt or sugar since I eliminated major sources of those from my diet. But yesterday and today I caved in and had some pizza. Standard cheese pizza. 

In my head I thought that having something high in fiber with the pizza would mitigate the damage the dough (refined carb) and cheese (saturated fatty acids) combination would cause. 

I've read a bit about how one or the other won't harm you as much as previously thought if you're regularly active and not overweight. But that the combination of both is what causes the most cardiovascular problems. 

My question is, is my thought process reasonable? Does it make sense to think that eating an avocado and some homecooked beans with the pizza would mitigate the damaging effects of the sugar and triglyceride spike in the blood? 

Would this affect some food more than others? For example, pita bread and home made guacamole be less damaging than having pita bread and cheese? 

What about food like dark chocolate, high in saturated fats, high in fiber and moderate added sugar?

They also have veggie burgers and French fries, but they’re mushroom based and I hate mushrooms so I usually get fries.

Just recently switched to drinking La Croix versus stuff like soda and other sugary beverages,"I know I am super late on this fad, but I just realized that La Croix has calories, sweetener or sodium. I was very happy to have a drink that I could enjoy like a soda or juice that was much better for me. However after some research, I found out the carbonated water isn’t very good for my teeth. 

I am someone who doesn’t have the best teeth, definitely not the worst, and I want to avoid as much additional damage to my teeth as possible.

After realizing this, I had a thought that there had to be a similar beverage that was equivalent to La Croix but just not carbonated. Therefore being the absolute best drink to have, besides water.

Does anyone know of such a beverage? 

Also I drink water as much as I can during the day, especially when I am active. So I know water is the absolute best to have. However I really enjoy flavor, and that’s why I was happy to learn how great of an option La Croix was. I have tried lemon and water and similar things but at that point I would rather just have water by itself.

I recently started a La Croix kick, but now i’m realizing that the carbonation isn’t good for my teeth. Is there a naturally flavored non carbonated water that I can buy at the store?",nutrition,1535675953,Banananers,73,89,True,2018-08-30

"Need advice on some lifestyle changes. Mostly my diet, I have some ideas but need advice on if they're on the right track or not.","Sorry for the long post, if you'd like you can skip down to where you see (2.) And thats where i ask about diet. Also the few questions at the end.

So I'm 19. And just got my first physical and blood work in years. I got a call this morning to say everything looks good, but I have very low vitamin D levels. And I have ""quite high"" cholesterol for my age. This was left in my voicemail so I'll be calling tomorrow to follow up on it. They said they want me to try to make lifestyle changes to fix it before they medicate me. But they did give me the option for a prescription of vitamin D that I would take once a week, or to take over the counter supplements.

I think my vitamin D levels are low because 1: I work night shifts and sleep in the afternoons. 2: my wife is pregnant and gets migraines so we don't go out much in this southern 90+ degree heat were having. I think I'm going to ask for the prescription.

High cholesterol runs in my family, and it could quite possibly be what killed my grandfather. He  had multiple strokes/heart attacks from a young age, until he died somewhere around 58-62 years old. 

So I need to make some changes, my thoughts were as follows:

(1.) Start some light exercise. I don't have time to get into a heavy weight lifting routine like I did once in the past. But maybe each morning when I get home from work take my dog for a light jog. Or go myself. The only hurtle for this would be days I don't sleep much. I end up coming home the next morning and immediately napping for an hour. So I would have to try to avoid that or else I won't end up going for that jog.

(2.) Diet, I'm thinking I need to cut out my huge greasy meals. For breakfast, try to stick with plain oatmeal and add fruits to it myself to make it healthy. Eggs with only a little cheese (maybe I should look up healthy cheeses) with maybe avocado? Maybe some light pico de galo? And stick to whole grain/wheat breads for toast if I have any. 
Lunch/dinner, try to mostly eliminate red meat, even though I can't completely. Eat fish and chicken mostly. And make sure I get large portions of veggies. Also maybe eggplant lasagna or parm. And maybe casseroles that have good meats, veggies and cheeses. 

Questions: is it ok to eat pork with high cholesterol? 
What about turkey? 
What are healthier ways I could have pasta?
What are some healthy snacks I could bring to work? Besides fruit

Is it even possible to know what diet is healthy?,"For the past 2 years, I've been bouncing around, researching multiple diets; Paleo, low carb, no carb, carnivorous, plant based / vegan, vegetarian, mediterranean, etc. At the end of researching each diet, a new gang of research presents to me 'evidence' showing an alternative diet is superior and that everything that I'd just learned was wrong. As a result, I've been sitting here for the past 2 years not knowing which diet is the best for overall health. I'd also like to add the reoccurring problem being people by default connecting the term 'healthy diet' to losing weight when I'm more concerned of cardiovascular health and things like that.

How to easily get all micronutrients,"So I've been wanting to simplify my nutrition and to do that I thought that I might try to find what foods I have to eat every day to get all the micros that I need. To make it even easier on myself, I wanted to try and limit it to as few foods as I can, kind of like Stan Efferding does with ""The Vertical Diet""; he eats just enough veggies to get all his vitamins and minerals and then stocks up on rice and red meat to gain lots of muscle. So my idea is to find a few foods that are really nutrient dense, and make sure I eat them every day, then just eat whatever tastes good to get the calories I need.

&amp;#x200B;

To do this I just started putting things in Cronometer that I thought would be superfoods, like blueberries, spinach, kiwi (as described by Jeff Nippard). But what I found was that almost none of those foods actually gave me enough micros in a reasonable quantity. Very strange, and then after some googling research I found other ""superfoods"" that actually gave me a lot more than I expected (like potatoes, who would've thought!). So this is the list I came up with, I tried to stick to vegetarian sources:

&amp;#x200B;

\---List of foods---

\-Potatoes

\-Oats

\-Almonds

\-Beans

\-Eggs

&amp;#x200B;

According to Cronometer, an average human should get MOST micro needs by eating this. If you actually put these foods into cronometer you'll see that some vitamins are missing, but I found that it is pretty easy to fill those gaps with just about any other food. I see the list above like a base to build my diet on. So according to cronometer,  potatoes are your best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

I found this very strange, since I've always been taught that fruits and veggies are important because of all the vitamins and minerals, but I actually tried to put a lot of those into Cronometer but none of them showed any significant increase in anything useful. I'm actually a bit sceptical of this and wondering if I might have missed something.

&amp;#x200B;

That's why I'm turning to you guys. I'd like to hear your opinion on all this! Is this list incomplete? Should something be replaced or added? Is it even a good idea to structure your diet like this?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

What effect does metabolism have on maintenance calories?,"I remember when I was younger I always knew a few people that seemingly no matter what they ate, they would stay skinny. It seemed to be a common thing that most people chalked up to good genes or a fast metabolism. Conversely, I had friends who would always play pickup basketball/football like the rest of us, eat the same garbage food we all ate as kids (a lot of fast food type stuff) and they would be fatter than everyone else.

I know there's always other factors at play, but seemingly a lot of people can relate to this, knowing people who were effected by food and exercise differently.

That being said, as I've gotten older and gotten into fitness, I've seen a lot of people talk about ""maintenance calories"" and how going below them will help you lose weight, and above them will help you gain weight. When people talk about maintenance calories, it seems to generally include our lifestyle (do you move around a lot, exercise, etc.) and our height/weight. Two people with the same job, same exercise habits, same height and same weight would likely be said to have roughly the same ""maintenance calories.""

It seemingly makes sense. But my question is, where does metabolism and genes factor into all of this?

Why is it so hard to find healthy/high quality food that isn't full of marketing gimmicks?,"Hello everyone,

I believe I lead a healthy lifestyle and I enjoy high quality produce a lot. However, I do not believe in, what are for me, largely marketing gimmicks. For me, and every concrete study, GMOs are harmeless. Organic food aren't necessarily pesticide free, although they do have less than non organic, but both are way within the FDA's safety levels. Even water is unhealthy if you reach certain levels! I don't believe in natural (what does that even mean?) or ""chemical free"" (so your product is made of ... nothing?) etc. Organic also uses 60% land. I also don't believe in locally raised since it makes no economic sense and can actually pollute more than importing from warmer places. 

Yet, it's so hard to find high-quality products that aren't much more expensive because they are full of marketing gimmicks (For example, organic can be more than a dollar extra just because it's organic at Trader Joe's). The problem, I believe, is that wealthy people who want higher quality products are also willing to pay the premium for gluten free, organic, non - GMO etc. stuff whose so people assume organic = high - quality, when it's just, they can afford high - quality and organic so let's put them together for more $$$.

As I've said before, I have no interest in paying that premium (for economic, environmental, and ideological reasons (I despise how marketers use these meaningless terms to promote their products like GMO free salt.... SALT!)), but I **want** tasty tomatoes and other produces, high quality bread, premium meat, nuts, etc. Does anyone know certain brands/stores that would have such products?

What is the difference between 100% whole wheat and 100% whole grain bread?,"I'm here because of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/82hgg8/according_to_this_harvard_study_whole_wheat_bread/). I've been getting [Nature's Valley 100% Whole Wheat Bread](http://www.naturesownbread.com/sandwich-bread/100-whole-wheat) *for years*, assuming it has a favorable glycemic load. That post I linked has me wondering if I should've always been getting [this bread instead](http://www.naturesownbread.com/sandwich-bread/100-whole-grain) (and yes -- I know this is pretty trivial in terms of my health, but health/nutrition has always been a hobby of mine so this type of conflict gets me swarming to the Internet to figure it out).

Like a commenter mentioned, whole wheat is not whole grain. That being true, I wanted to actually hypothesize why whole wheat would have a similar glycemic index as a refined grain. I'm now more confused. According to my Google searches:


&gt;[Whole wheat means that the bread is made from the entire wheat kernel](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/grains.html)


&gt;[Whole grain means that the bread can be made of any whole-grain kernel. That grain may be wheat or it could be another grain like spelt, oats, or barley. The bread might even be made using a mixture of different whole grains.](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/grains.html)


So, if whole wheat *is* a **type of whole grain**, then why would it still have a similar GI to white bread? I'm even more confused with this distinction because to me, whole grain sounds like what the multigrain label is after.

Another popular website even mentioned the whole wheat vs. whole grain glycemic index finding:

&gt;[Whole grain and whole wheat breads rank very differently according to the glycemic index. A whole grain bread scores a 51 on the index, making it a moderate glycemic food. However, whole wheat bread scores a 71 on the index, categorizing it as a high glycemic food. A diabetic will do better choosing the whole grain bread over the whole wheat one.](https://www.livestrong.com/article/467087-whole-grain-bread-vs-whole-wheat-bread-for-diabetes/)

**TL;DR Should I bet getting [this 100% whole grain](http://www.naturesownbread.com/sandwich-bread/100-whole-grain) bread instead of this [100% whole wheat](http://www.naturesownbread.com/sandwich-bread/100-whole-wheat) for the purpose of staying full?**",nutrition,1535848876,Yellow_partyhat,15,56,True,2018-09-01

For the last 6 months or so, I've been on a sort of paleo diet where I avoid most carbs except for black beans, 4-5 times a week. Then I'd eat whatever I wanted 2-3 times a week.

Well, I want to lose more weight, maybe go down to 76kg or so, before I start hitting the gyms hard and gain weight as muscle.

Can someone explain why the same amount of sugar is supposed to be worse than other carbs?,"I barely eat sugar, and I've had a pretty 'clean' diet for a long while and feel good, it's not like I'm missing something. 
But, from a nutritional view of point, fructose (as in HFCS or  simply fruits) is pretty bad regarding how it affects the liver and metabolises quite fast into fat. I get how fruit has a lot of vitamins and fiber, so that would undo a little of the harm (although I personally prefer not to have TO MUCh fruit and rather more veggies/starches, often because I simply prefer them).

But: sugar is basically glucose+fructose, so it's even a little 'better', metabolically speaking.

Good and bad about Sticky Rice (Glutinous Rice)?,"I'm thinking of opening up a business that involves sticky rice as the main ingredient for majority of the dishes.

There's the healthy trend towards people's everyday diet. I wanted to know the actual truth about sticky rice. When I search sticky rice in google, all it says are the good stuff. I have a strong feeling these articles are biased.

I've been told as a kid not to eat sticky rice too often as it's kinda hard to digest and if you it too much you'll get stomach ache. I'm not sure if that's true or not. I've never eaten a lot of sticky rice at once. 

Could some expert tell me about some facts about sticky rice? I mainly want to compare it with many people's daily diet. Like compare it with regular white rice, brown rice, bread, pasta, etc.  Basically, what's spectacular about sticky rice that some other normal food don't have in terms of nutrition view point.

Keto/low carb question,"Actual question in around 2 paragraphs, sorry for the wall

So, background since I think this is my first post here. A few years ago I decided I was just too fat. I was late 20s and had not infrequent chest pains even. starting point 5'10"" 275lbs. 

I didnt go nuts on any specific diet, I just did a heavy calorie restriction, took a multivitamin just in case for the sake of micros (which I actually stopped taking) and over the course of a year dropped to a low point of 165. maintained at about 170 over the last few years at 3000 kcal/day. By this I mean I eat generally whole food but also some other (admittedly) crap like icecream. 

For the sake of health, I thought I would take a look at replacing some of the more ""pointless"" calories in my usual diet with something that has more value. Not that, say, white rice is necessarily bad provided I have a decently balanced diet, but hey, might as well see whats out there. 

Note: I am always skeptical of ""fad"" diets as well as high exclusion diets. Simple calorie restriction worked for weight loss even at probably 40% carbs.

So, what better way to look at ideas of replacing carb heavy ingredients than look at low carb or keto recipes. Looking into keto, I see that, rather than just being a calorie deficit masquerading as a novel diet, the whole point is about altering body chemistry away from carb metabolism toward fat metabolism. I thought I'd try it for a little bit just to see. while I havent done it too long (like 2 weeks) it seems incredibly difficult to keep carb counts incredibly low while eating at a maintenance of 3000kcal and still get a decent variety of vegetables and such. Results notwithstanding, this seems pretty annoying to upkeep honestly and I've always also told people who ask about my own weight loss that the best diet is one thats sustainable.

But back to my actual question, So, IF keto diets are basing on being IN ketosis and ketosis is defined as using ketones instead of glucose and IF the ceiling on your carbs is quite low where you would be ""kicked from"" ketosis, I assume this would mean your body would attempt to revert to glucose. So, what happens on relatively low but not ketosis level carbs? as a simple example, a low carb paleo type diet? are energy levels lower than either a keto or \~40% carb?",nutrition,1531854103,BastiatCF,4,1,True,2018-07-17

Should I go to a nutritionist or how do I start out?,"Hello,

I have had some traumatic experiences in my life the past decade; before then I was fairly skinny. I am now over weight and over all feel horrible. One good thing I have going for me is that, if there is healthy food in the house, it is not hard for me to discipline myself to eat it. I do not crave junk food. I've been like that since I was a little kid. 

No one has ever taught me how to shop for groceries in a healthy way, what supplements I need, etc. I know one can say, ""It's just fruits and vegetables,"" however, that is easier said than done. Obviously one doesn't want a salad every day and wants more options that are healthy. I am so ignorant on this subject though. A long time ago I became a vegan for a while but because I am not educated on nutrition I felt horrible all the time and had no energy at all. So, I went back to meat.

Will a nutritionist help me with a grocery plan and possibly tell me what I'm in the most need of? I heard about something where your blood can be tested and ran through a computer and it can tell the person what they are deficient in and what they have plenty of. I am not sure what the title of that job is though.

What is the best compromise to take the benefits of Keto and eat fairly normally? OMAD and moderate regulation?,"I'm currently transferred from Keto to full Carnivore, with just meat, cheese, and eggs, and I'm coming to the conclusion I am NOT like these lifers on both r/zerocarbs or r/keto.

I'm enjoying the benefits of the diet. Never have felt healthier, sure. But I'd rather feel sicker and have the damn freedom to eat a larger variety of food and rely on discipline and knowledge to limit troubling intake or something.

I don't want to eat ground beef and cheese my whole damn life, when I've experienced so little flavors to begin with.

Food to me is too important to socialization and culture as human beings for me to sacrifice the primary food group the majority of the damn world eats.

It feels like culinary suicide to limit myself to such a narrow diet that prevents me from trying a vast majority of the world's food.

So what's the most reasonable option here? OMAD, interrupted whenever I feel like it, with a focus on privately eating more natural, avoiding sugar and refined carbs (and looking at glycemic numbers), and avoiding heavily processed foods?

Where is a good place to transition from Keto / Carnivore to, well, a flexible diet that allows room for trying new things? An occasional binge with friends? Sometimes getting sloshed on booze?

I feel like Keto / carnivore possibly affecting the gut biome and making carbs incredibly painful to eat does not seem to make it a long term diet that can utilize ""cheating"" to experience this.

I'm a 21 year old girl, 5'6, about 159 pounds. I've recently decided to work on making some positive changes and lose some weight, but also get better nutrition, since I've found out I have anemia and some vitamin deficiencies. 

I started using Cronometer to log everything I eat and get a good idea of what I'm really missing and what I get too much of. What I'm not really sure about is what nutrition targets I should strive towards. Are the targets Cronometer sets based on my information enough? I particularly want to focus on reducing my sugar intake. What sugar target should I set and try not surpass? What about cholesterol? Is there a healthy caffeine intake target you recommend I shouldn't surpass?

Apart from my questions, any advice you have based on the information I've given would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",nutrition,1531925035,TheElectraMNE,1,1,True,2018-07-18
"Lysine, Arginine, and Protein Content","I'm trying to eat foods that are high-lysine, low-arginine, or have 2:1 lysine to arginine ratio for medical reasons. As I understand it, lysine and arginine are two components of protein on a nutrition label - so here's my question: 

Is the arginine content of a food directly related to how much protein the food contains? 

Ex) If a high-arginine food like chocolate only contains 1-2 grams of protein in a serving, should I not worry about the arginine content because total protein is low?",nutrition,1531927837,bcoax,9,3,True,2018-07-18

The Great Apple-ing... :),"Hey, I recently participate in a sponsored diet fest, to promote various different types of diets, ranging from lactose free to gluten free etc. As a participant I got to chose from various different diet plans to ""try out"" during my sponsored run.

Unfortunately allocation of the diet plans was some what mutually exclusive. Basically all the fun ones and or good ones were pretty much already allocated when I signed up for the sponsor time. And the only ones left were the weird ones lol, and I got lumbered with this one called the apple fast. But I thought, hu, what the hell, it's all for charity, i'll give it a go.

While on this apple fast thing, which lasted only 3 days for me, I was only allowed to eat, well you guessed it... apples :) And since I'm a growing lad, I ate quite a lot of apples hehe :) But something very odd happened at the end of the three days. 

On the third day when I woke up in the morning, I couldn't stand up, like I literally would feel as if I was going to pass out any time to was standing. But if I layed down, like in a horizontal position i'd feel better. Anyway long story short, a friend called an ambo, and I was carted off to A&amp;E - which was NOT a fun experience lol. When I got seen by the doc, they did some tests, and my friend told them about the apple fast thing, and they did this intravenous drip thing and instructed me to eat some bread. I was kinda out of it at the time, and I don't really remember what the doc said, other than my friend told me they mentioned mild Hypoglycemia.

But this is my question, why would eating apples for three days cause such a weird thing to happen ? Like the sponsor organizers said all the diet plans were nutritionally approved, and I must say I never thought that you could affect your blood sugar so adversely, just by eating what I would consider to be a healthy food.

Can anyone explain this to me ? I'm kind curious why this happened in a weird way to be honest.

Nutritional quality of matcha,"Hi r/Nutrition! I'm working on making some healthy lifestyle changes and I feel like one of the easiest changes to make is to become a regular tea drinker. I've been doing quite a bit of research on matcha and I wanted some input regarding my findings and my plans for incorporating the stuff into my daily routine. 

I know matcha has been a huge fad (at least in the U.S.) in the last few years, but I have a bachelor's degree in biology so I feel like I'm pretty capable of understanding primary literature and sorting the legit health benefits out from the bogus ones. Right off the bat I'd like to establish that I will be talking about traditionally brewed matcha tea, not supplements or lattes or any of that other stuff.  

These are the reasons I've established for why matcha seems to be the healthiest choice of tea for me.

*  Green tea is already established as an incredibly healthy ""superfood"", with a centuries-old track record of keeping people healthy in Asian cultures. 
* Matcha seems to have most of the same nutritional qualities as steeped green tea, except more concentrated, as it is whole powdered tea leaves.  

And here are the potential concerns that I have for drinking matcha every day. 

* Many sources say that if there are any risks associated with matcha, the most severe is likely lead seeping into the tea plants from the soil (mainly in polluted areas of China). I believe buying organic Japanese matcha should minimize this risk. 
* Anything in excess can be a poison. Matcha is very concentrated tea with a decent amount of caffeine in it, and I want to be sure that the amount I consume on a daily basis is healthy for the long run. I'm considering having a 2 gram (1 teaspoon) serving once or twice a day, in addition to a few cups of other teas.

 I will try to make this as short as to the point as possible...

But I want to also be able to \*\*keep track of some additional parameters\*\* and data (numbers) that I'd collect (pH and personal assessment of the activity of X and Y). These parameters should be displayed in some sort of graph on a timeline (ideally). Perhaps some other way. At this point I'm not really sure.

  
So as healthcare professionals you may know of some application that is capable of doing that? If not, I'm open to any kind of advice and am available for follow ups questions etc. God bless you.

"As simply a fitness/nutrition hobbyist (not formally trained in medicine or nutrition) how do you guard against confirmation bias? For instance, I enjoy eating high fat low carb and the paleo ethos appeals to me but I am uneasy about disregarding conventional advice to limit saturated fats...","Obviously if I search for paleo, keto, and/or zero carb blogs, sites, and forums I will find what looks like logical arguments against the conventional wisdom.  I will even find sources of clinical trials that show the benefits of paleo, keto, and/or zero carb. These sites love to publish evidence of fraud in the origins of conventional recommendations that counter their position. But I have no doubt I could find sites of similar logic and evidence talking about the benefits of eating whole foods and moderating your fat and animal consumption. But this has generally more recommended by the medical establishment. And as of right now if I have a serious medical issue I think it is obviously a better course of action to go to a dr/ hospital vs googling for the answer ‘I want to hear.’ 

The reason I am currently questioning my bias is that I have been eating paleo for a while now, and intermittently doing a week or 2 of keto, and I feel great. I have lost body fat feel motivated and energized. Then I recently saw this table ([https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/229002](https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/229002)) on the uptodate app (this app markets itself as having the most logical and up-to-date evidence driven stance on medical issues, and to their credit they do state that much of the past warning against dietary fat intake percentage of calories for affecting risk of heart disease and for causing obesity were wrong). However, this table shows that fats that I have been led to believe are more harmful (canola and various seed oils) are actually better at improving lipid levels that are associated with heart disease than the fats I have understood to be healthy (olive oil, coconut oil, grass fed butter, high fat grass fed meat, etc). I thought olive oil was the one unassailable fat, loved by blue zone diet adherents, paleos, ketos, saturated fat avoiders and the like. So how do you avoid bias and which fats should I be eating?

I'm also a very freezy person, so even if I take out regular food from the refrigerator, I often pop it into the microwave for like 5 seconds to have it at room temperature.

So my food is usually high in nutrients, but I'm scared I might damage the nutrients with the way of preparing my dishes.

Why is there so much variability and stark differences in diets? What do you believe?,"On the one hand you have vegans who don't eat meat and on the other hand you have carnivores who only eat meat.
Then You have ketogenic and high carb. Again two totally opposite ideologies.


All this makes me really doubt nutrition in general. I don't know who or what to believe or even if anyone knows anything. Following either one can have both positive or negative consequences. For example A high fat low carb diet could very well help you lose weight but at the same time it can clog your arteries. (The science is debatable but I'll stick to what mainstream medicine says).



Right now I eat a diet of 50% carb 30% protein and 20% fat. I eat rice, meat, bread, beans, yoghurt and a good hefty serving of fruits and vegetables. I don't have a six pack but I look healthy and feel pretty alright. I dont really gain muscle or lose weight easily however. So I don't know if its optimal.

Chia seed nutrition facts discrepancy,"I've always read ""chia seeds are chia seeds"" ""brand doesn't matter"" and even statements saying there is no nutritional difference between black and white chia seeds.

I just bought a new brand today (Wheat Montana) and I compared it to what I had at home already (Southern Grove/Aldis). There are a lot of differences on the nutrition facts table, but the product itself seems the exact same. The only thing I thought I was getting different aside from a new brand was the certified USDA organic slapped on the bag. The serving size on one says 2tbsp weighs almost a much as 1tbsp of the other. I'll post the nutrition facts and see if you guys can figure this out..





 | Southern Grove | Wheat Montana
---|---|----
Serving Size | 1 tbsp (15g) | 2 tbsp (13g)
Calories| 80| 70
Fat| 5g | 5g
Carbs | 6g | 4g
Protein | 3g | 2g

As you can see right off the bat, the weights for 1 tbsp are dramatically different, which is concerning. If you took equivalent serving sizes (by volume) the organic Wheat Montana chia would be less than half as nutritional as the Southern Grove brand.

Questions regarding food combos in my daily routine which might be bad.,"So I've been lurking alot this subreddit lately with subjects regarding multivitamins and food combinations amongst other thigs. Which one works with the other? Which one doesnt? is it worth taking MVMs? If so, which one? When to take them and which ones should be taken separate from others? And so on. All these questions and I can't say I found some general consensus except some specific cases (e.g. green tea + iron rich food is bad)

So basically my day starts with a breakfast consisting most of the times of oats,nuts,raisins, some dried fruits and milk. 
First question here: How bad is the combination of milk + the others?

30 mins after that I drink my coffees. Black with cocoa powder. 2 cups, 1 tsp cocoa powder each. 
Now my second question: How bad is the combination of milk eaten during breakfast with the coffee?

After lunch i take the MVMs tablets which have around 70-75% RDA of the following: vit E , vit C, iron, zinc, vit K, B6, B2, B1, B12, Pantothenic Acid, Folic Acid, Niacin, Lutein, Iodine, Biotin + a separate tablet (sometimes 2, 1 after dinner) of Calcium 200 mg + Magnesium 100mg. Is there any conflict between these tablets?

30 min before hitting the gym I usually eat one apple and another cup of coffee. Anything bad on this combo?

Last question: Immediately after everything I eat I drink tons of water to inhibit my never ending hunger. Bad or good?

7 Reasons why you should give up Diet Coke today!,"Diet coke may seem like a good idea at first, but their side effects are very worrying

Diet soda isn’t a much healthier alternative to regular coke

Diet soda has been associated with several risks

1. Metabolic Syndrome - A [study](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/4/688.short) of about 10,000 adults found that 1 soda drink a day could cause up to a 34% increased risk of metabolic syndrome.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes** \- [Aspartame (An artificial sweetener in diet sodas) reduces the action of a gut enzyme](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2016-0346#.WwLiV4oh2Uk) that's ordinarily protective against Type 2 diabetes.
3. **Depression** \- The American Academy of Neurology have found that people who consume artificially sweetened drinks have as high as[ 30% risk of going into depression](https://www.aan.com/pressroom/home/pressrelease/1128).
4. Weight loss - [Low-calorie sweetener use may not be an effective means of weight control](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167241)
5. **Heart disease** \- Research indicates that, men who drank two or more cans of Diet Coke per day had a 23% higher chance of developing heart failure.
6. **Kidney disease** \- A [research](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022238/) done in 2009 of over 3,000 women found a link between diet soda and kidney problems.

Sports/Fitness Nutrition Certification,"I'm interested in getting a certification in sports/fitness nutrition for my own personal knowledge and self improvement but am having trouble picking the best one for me. After the research I've done, I have it narrowed down to the following:

AFPA

NASM

I'm interested in AFPA due to the fact that their course overview covers the psychological link between individuals and eating disorders, which I am particularly interested in. However, I can't seem to find much information on them other than their own website which leads me to believe that they may not be as reputable or well known. The other two have a plethora of information, but how do you go about picking the right one for you? I want to ensure whichever I decide is a true and reputable source.

Off-Brand(Walmart) Quest Bar thoughts,"Quest bars, from what I can tell, are quite good at getting your protein and fiber whilst being low in sugar. The only problem is their price. I found some bars very similar at Walmart for at least $2.00 less for four bars.

They are the ""off-brand"" equate bars https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Protein-Bar-Blueberry-Muffin-2-12-Oz-4-Ct/188893113

Quest bars for comparison https://www.target.com/p/quest-nutrition-174-protein-bar-blueberry-muffin-4ct/-/A-52047999

The nutrition is as close as you can get, with less sugar and only 2 grams more of erythritol.

The off-brand Equate bars are much harder, but that can be solve quite easily by tossing them in the microwave for a few seconds. They also aren't extremely addicting like Quest Bars which benefits me in the long run.

Carbs/sodium bloat?,"27 yrs old - 5'11 / 70kg

8 Ways You Can Reduce Kitchen Waste and Why It Matters,"Did you know it's plastic free july, when you're supposed to refuse all single waste plastic items? 

A [recent article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-landfills-plastic-papers.html) in the NY Times got me thinking. I’ve always been a big recycler. Or rather, I \*thought\* I was a big recycler. It turns out I’m an “aspirational recycler”. Throwing out recycling makes me feel good about myself, which means I’ll throw out things that are questionable, or dirty and think, “Eh, the city will pull out things they can’t use” or “Well this plastic bag SHOULD be recyclable, dammit!” and I put it in the bin as a micro form of protest.

I had no idea that these habits can actually make a batch of recycling so undesirable that it could be sent straight to a landfill. Many of us are simply unaware of where our trash goes when it’s zipped away from the curb and we’re okay with that. Someone else will figure it out, right?

It turns out that a 1/3rd of recycling is shipped out of our country to be recycled. Crazy right? Due to a recent ban in China, now half of that recycling has nowhere to go, leading cities to be forced to either store recyclables while they figure it out or to dump them into landfills.

With that article looming in my mind, I started to think about food packaging. It’s ubiquitous and we’ve all seen ridiculous examples of wasteful packaging. (If you haven’t check out this hilarious yet completely depressing [buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sophiegadd/absolutely-ridiculously-packaged-foods).)

While there’s tons of packaging we throw away each day, food packaging makes up a huge chunk of it. About [2/3rds](http://www.ift.org/Knowledge-Center/Read-IFT-Publications/Science-Reports/Scientific-Status-Summaries/Editorial/Food-Packaging-and-Its-Environmental-Impact.aspx) of our daily trash comes just from prepping three meals a day and maybe a few snacks. With such a large portion of trash coming from the kitchen, we have the opportunity to make a huge impact by looking at how we prepare our food.

As you may have noticed, I’m a big fan of starting with small changes that we can build on to create lasting change. Just like how we can get used to portion sizes sneaking up on us, we can also get used to other unhealthy habits too. Check out a few ideas below on how you can reduce your waste and let me know what other ideas you have!

Health Recovery. How to Lose Excess Weight,"""Now when excess sugar turns into fat. This stimulates the formation of cholesterol in the body, reduces digestive and protective functions, changes the intestinal microflora, creates tension in the pancreas, followed by the development of diabetes. Diabetes is a disease caused not by sugar itself but by its abuse. Leading a healthy lifestyle can prevent and cure this rather serious disease. Of course, sugar should not be discarded. But if you get sick, you have to give up sugar completely.

Especially dangerous is the abuse of sweets for children. Chocolate, sweets, cakes are all diabetes, diathesis, allergic manifestations, metabolic disorders, dental diseases, excess fat. The daily dose of sugar should not exceed 30-40 grams.""

""Don't drink while eating. The liquids are consumed no later than 10-15 minutes before meals and only 1.5-2 hours after meals. Gastric juice and hydrochloric acid (pepsin) in particular are necessary for food processing. The heavier it is (the animal proteins), the acid concentration must be greater.

Diluting gastric juice with any liquid we reduce its concentration as well as bile and pancreatic juice. Then the strength of a hydrochloric acid is insufficient for proper processing of food which will not be digested in the future but will rot in the intestine. So we create all the conditions for intoxication and the occurrence of diseases. This is also due to the fact that the lack of hydrochloric acid in the body is fraught with large disruptions in the work of the entire digestive tract. This especially affects the elderly, in which the secretion of hydrochloric acid decreases to 15% of the 20-year-old age.""

**Glucotypes reveal new patterns of glucose dysregulation**
&gt;Abstract

&gt;Diabetes is an increasing problem worldwide; almost 30 million people, nearly 10% of the population, in the United States are diagnosed with diabetes. Another 84 million are prediabetic, and without intervention, up to 70% of these individuals may progress to type 2 diabetes. Current methods for quantifying blood glucose dysregulation in diabetes and prediabetes are limited by reliance on single-time-point measurements or on average measures of overall glycemia and neglect glucose dynamics. We have used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to evaluate the frequency with which individuals demonstrate elevations in postprandial glucose, the types of patterns, and how patterns vary between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance and secretion highlights the fact that the physiology underlying dysglycemia is highly variable between individuals. We developed an analytical framework that can group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses called “glucotypes” that reveal heterogeneity, or subphenotypes, within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. Importantly, we found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. We thus show that glucose dysregulation, as characterized by CGM, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures, and specific patterns of glycemic responses reflect variable underlying physiology. The interindividual variability in glycemic responses to standardized meals also highlights the personal nature of glucose regulation. Through extensive phenotyping, we developed a model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and built a webtool for visualizing a user-uploaded CGM profile and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes.",nutrition,1532544067,1345834,36,20,True,2018-07-25
My father doesn’t enough protein (or anything for that matter),"  My father is 62 and is luckily not overweight but he is pre-diabetic. For a while now he hasn’t eaten much meat, I usually see him eating soups, vegies and sweets (mom won’t stop buying them!). I’m not sure if it was because of his molar work recently or not but he has stopped eating meat almost cold turkey. He says it’s lost the taste for it, and it's tedious for him to chew. He is willing to eat fish, but isn’t fond of soy (unless I can get him good data). This is all very troubling because he almost doesn’t eat; I don’t know how he’s not emaciated or fat. He doesn’t even eat the sweets often because ever since I’ve stopped eating them the boxes of 10-12 cupcakes or brownies sit there for almost 2 months. Many of you may think I’m just exaggerating but he for ages (at least a decade perhaps) now he has always felt tired or weak, possibly sick, and has had trouble sleeping at night, but will sleep several times in the day. My major questions are:

1. What are good high-calorie foods that aren’t hard to chew? I heard lentils are nutrient-rich but what are other options?

2. What sources of protein can he get? I can probably convince him to eat a protein shake here and there but he can’t subsist solely off that.

3. I can probably convince him to drink some of his calories a la green shake, but he can eat vegetables just fine. Is there any other kind of drink with high nutrients I can get him?",nutrition,1532546676,Sunraizer,3,2,True,2018-07-25

Feel fine but still worried,"Hey guys, new to this sub. I have begun a loose paleo style diet. I am doing the diet to lose roughly 10 pounds and after that I will increase my intake to build muscle. I am also doing cardio for roughly 1/2 hr and weight lifting for 1/2 hr.

This all started because I realized my once toned body had become not toned. After weaning my child, who sucked 400 calories out of my diet daily I realized I needed to adjust to not eating everything I see and controlling portions. I decided on 1700 calories for a slow loss. I work a reception job though I am fairly active out of work.  

Anyways, my concerns:

1. I have been only eating 1300-1500 calories since I started, though my target is 1700. I didn't even realize it until I add it all up the following day. I feel absolutely fine, and the food I have been eating is very good stuff (salad, strawberries, eggs, oatmeal (said it was loose paleo, so don't jump me), etc. Nothing bad. Is it all going to catch up to me or do you think I'm ok as long as I don't feel tired, deprived or hungry?
2. My macros are off. Like I said above I am eating healthy food. But I google everything, and I am only supposed to consume 25 grams of sugar and I'm around 35-40 g. I am also a bit high on fats, not bad, but I just don't get it. 

Can I get some guidance? Am I focusing on the wrong things? I have felt amazing since I have started, and very proud of myself, because I was eating so poorly before. Please be nice, I want to be healthy is all!",nutrition,1532555423,PaigeIRL,1,1,True,2018-07-25

How do I determine the calorific contents in restaurant meals?,"Hi. This might be a noob question, but I'm looking for some generic advice on nutrition control. Usually I prepare my own food, but I've been resorting to takeaway meals and eating out due to time constraints and being temporarily unable to cook. I'm maintaining a \~2:3:5 carb/fat/protein ratio at \~1600 kcals, and most of the times I attempt to opt for meals that contain more lean meats or proteins.

The thing is, eating outside, there's no way but to guesstimate the nutritional profile of the meal, since the way food is prepared can lead to huge variations in terms of calories. For instance (correct me if I'm wrong) marination and butter or oil searing techniques can add quite a lot to the fat count of food.

Furthermore, I don't really have a good feel on what exactly 100g of some specific food on a plate looks like. This obviously leads to an inaccurate numeric estimation of how many calories I'm about to consume.The reason I'm posting about this is actually that I've recently moved to China for a short term job, and the local restaurants all happen to be very unsparing with oil while cooking. Even the veggies appear to be basted with oil and I'm dipping everything in water to get rid of a surfaced portion of the fat.So I guess I'd like to raise a few main questions:

1. How well do different foodstuffs absorb oil, and how do I accurately estimate the nutritional content in food just by looking at it?
2. Is there some sort of chart about the nutrition contents of Chinese and/or non-Chinese prepared meals, and how does 100g of those meals look like?
3. If you're based around Guangdong, are there any ""less-keto"" restaurants that you'd recommend?

Actually I've been wanting to ask about how to count calories in non-labeled food for quite a long while, and sometimes I feel like the data on FatSecret or MyFitnessPal aren't entirely accurate sometimes. I'd appreciate any advice, thanks!

TL;DR: Moved to China for short term work, realized different cooking practices for same dishes can yield vastly different nutritional profiles. Exactly how different could they be though, and how do I tell? ",nutrition,1532593769,synthk,1,1,True,2018-07-26

Also from my research it seems that glucose is less sweet than sugar. My question is, would it be viable to replace sugar with pure glucose and put more of it, making the food higher in calories but overall healthier if you keep yourself within the maintenance calorie for the day?

Also, is cola sweetened with table sugar? Because I wasn't able to really find out. All cola related articles are just fearmongering clickbait, it seems.

"Best WOE for Healthy, Sustained Weightloss","I’m female, 40, 5’6” and 290 pounds. I was 350+ at my highest eight years ago and lost the 60 pounds by not being in college, being a bit more active and not eating cafeteria food three times a day. (I was in college for 10 years).

The old cliche applies to me: I’ve tried everything. Keto, paleo, IF, carnivore, vegan, no grains, all grains, low carb high fat, hi carb high fat, no carb no fat, cabbage soup, carrot diet, weight watchers, CICO and on and on....

I have depression, multiple autoimmune disorders, and severe binge eating, compulsive overeating and bulimia (occasionally). I am very fat. I am very sad. 

For exercise I get lots of walking in and am very mobile. I lumber a bit but I also walk everywhere. I don’t drive. I would say I carry my weight well and look more like 250 not 290.

So my question is how the hell does a person lose weight and keep it off. I’ve kept off the 60 pounds for eight years but that’s simply because I was eating ridiculous amounts in grad school and hated myself to the point of being suicidal. Now I cope or try to cope with life but my main outlet is still food.

I’ve done therapy and seen nutritionists but their information is contradictory so it’s hard to know what regime to follow. I know eat less move more, I’m not retarded, but it’s simple to say and oh so difficult to do.

Does anyone have any tips for a good diet or way of eating that is reasonably easy to follow (like not counting calories and macros and weighing all of my food) that has proven successful for them in the long term? I ask for simple because anything beyond that and I doubt I will be able to stick with it.

How does one get a career in nutritional sciences? Help!,"Hi, r/nutrition! I need your help. I’m a student going into grade 12, and I’m very interested in nutritional sciences. I love everything to do with the subject: how certain minerals/chemicals affect the body, how an unhealthy diet can lead to diseases, nutrition facts labels, cooking, health in general, why problems like obesity are on the rise today, etc. I also listen to health lectures on a regular basis and I admire doctors such as Yoni Freedhoff and Robert Lustig. In the future, I’d love to become a dietician or complete food science related research. 

The issue I’m having is I don’t know where to apply or what I should major/minor in to take this pathway. Marks are not an issue and I’m very well disciplined. I love math, English, French, biology, chemistry.. Everything, really. Just not history.. 

All of the dietetics programs in Canada seem to specialize early, and my parents would like me to acquire a basic Bachelor of Science degree first, then go on to specialize later (because, you know, with jobs and money and what not). Is it possible to specialize in nutrition (Master’s) if you’re not majoring in it (Bachelor’s).

I’m sorry if this is confusing. I need to start thinking about this kind of thing now as before I know it, it’ll be time to submit university applications!

Looking for a book that will teach my teenage daughter how and why to eat healthy,"We give our daughter a lot of freedom with her diet. If she doesn’t like what we’ve prepared for dinner, she is allowed to make her own. She therefore eats a lot of macaroni and cheese.

-muffins are healthy. 
-eating less = losing belly fat = being attractive. 
-everybody has their own diet and they’re all equally healthy because everybody’s body is different.

Dry food for hiking,"Hello everyone , 

First of all a bit of background. Last year I went on a hiking trip,and to make my backpack light I didn't eat properly (basically dry ham and bread). 

I was thinking about dry food that you can buy on sport store but it's really expansive. So I want to do my own dryfood portion. Keeping in mind few points :

\- The food shouldn't have problem from the warm or cold

\- The food should last more than a week or two and can't rot

\- It needs to be light (I was thinking of max 100g/portion which provide 1 meal)

\- It should provide all the necessery nutriments

Now it's kind of hard to know what's needed, but i was thinking about : 

\- Oatmeal for carbohydrate ( and with water the sensation of fullness)

\- Dry fruits for carbohydrates as well

\- Different kind of peanut for lipid and a bit of protein

Healthiest way to gain fat and lose muscle mass?,"(Explanation/Diet below)

I'm currently about 147lbs at 5'11"", so just under 21 bmi. I have visible abs, veins on my forearms and biceps, visible collarbones etc. I want to gain fat and lose weight so I don't look like Bruce Lee. What is the healthiest way to do this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reason is I am MtF and have fairly large amounts of muscle on my upper body and a low bodyfat percentage, so look very masculine despite having (essnetially) no testosterone in my system for 15 months and high levels of estrogen.

I eat roughly 90-95% plant based whole foods diet, mainly whole grains, legumes/beans, veg, fruit, nuts, small amounts of dairy, fish three times a week (sardines usually), small portions of lean white meat 2-3 times a week (2oz), lean red meat once a week.

Home prepare and cook all my meals, eat out maybe twice a month and eat sensible options. Track macros every day, hit the WHO guidelines of under 5% added sugar and under 10% sat fat every day (occasionally under 10% added sugar, maybe 2-3 times a month). Exercise x6 a week, was half weightlifting lower body and half cardio for the past 14 weeks but switching to all cardio (LISS, 1 hour, stationary bike).

I was thinking the best way would be to increase nut, legume and whole grain intake, as veg doesn't give enough calories to clean bulk with (obviously I still eat plenty of veg). I'm not sure how much fruit I can get away with because I already hit 100g of sugar (at least 70g of which is natural sugars in fruits and veg), and I'm not sure if it'd be healthy to use excess dairy, fish or meat to bulk with.

I am finally feeling good enough to get back into the gym. Downside, my diet has been crap, and because of having baby sitters, and always someone available, I moved to 3rd shift at work. Now my issue is, it's been, 2 months since the switch, my body and sleep has adjusted but my meal times have not. I work until 5am, hit the gym until and get home around 7am, then I usually sleep until 1-1:30pm. I usually wake up and I'm not hungry. Some days I force myself to eat others I don't. Either way 4-5 hits and I'm starving. Then by the time I go to work I am usually not hungry until 3am. I know huge gap. Then when I am at the gym I work out, sometimes iget hungry sometimes I don't. I take my protein and I go to bed. Now, I am working on getting back to eating every 3-4 hours. My main question is, should I save my big startchy meal for after my workout still? I would basically eat it and go to bed. I don't know if that's frowned upon or not. The switch has been rough some days I eat well over my calorie goal and others I barely eat at all. Just looking for tips and suggestions to get back on track. The reason I lift after work is the SO and Kid are still sleeping and we spend time together before I go into work at night.

[Discussion] Breaking up Biofilm,"Greetings peeps!

I've been chasing down the final nail in the coffin in this candida/biofilm for quite some time now. I've tested and confirmed I have biofilm. I also have a few physical tells, such as oral thrush, extra puffiness around my waist, and vertical lines in my thumbnails. Of course there's a bit of brain fog, GI stuff with certain foods and fatigue.

Years ago I worked in a number of bars that were just disgusting. I cleaned the cooler out on a weekly basis for one bar, and I got bronchitis 3x in 6 months. Like, a full 2-3 weeks of bronchitis. It was mad house. Around the same time, I had antibiotics and crazy stress. Plenty of opportunity for fungi and bacteria to take hold, and Im certain that's what did it.

I've seen a functional medicine practitioner, underwent a regiment of supplements and did some damage, but ultimately I feel like not enough focus was put on disrupting the biofilm. I'm determined to get it done so I can get on with my life.

So I'm hitting it hard.

Kirkman biofilm defense, NAC, digestive enzymes, monolaurin and probiotics.

Pau d'arco, ginger, oregano, chaga, reishi, cordyceps, ACV, chlorella, echinacea/goldenseal, grapefruit seed extract

I've been paleo/gluten free nearly 2 years, and that has helped tremendously. I can be loose at times with grains, as I tolerate soaked oats and small amounts of organic corn. For this, I'm cutting all yeast, grains, all dairy. Focusing on fiber, coconut oil and prebiotics. I'm a nutritional health coach, so I feel like I have that side locked down.

\-------------------

I'll also be adding PEMF treatment after a few weeks.

PEMF info here: [https://www.drpawluk.com/education/magnetic-science/new-pemf-start/](https://www.drpawluk.com/education/magnetic-science/new-pemf-start/)

(This is good info, but I'm not using his products)

This is a pub med study on PEMF vs candida: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238117](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28238117)

\-------------------

I'll be focusing on drinking lots of water, getting lots of fresh air, long walks, yoga and kettle bells.

I'll be using infrared saunas 1-2x a week

I'll be dry brushing 1-2x a week

\-------------------

I plan on keeping this regiment steady for as many as 8 weeks, but might ease up around 6 if I feel I am making progress. I guess I'm curious if anyone here has fought a biofilm, in particular, and any tricks they used to slay the beast.

What is considered healthy food list for potential heart attack victims?,"Hello guys,  


This Wednesday my father had emergency surgery to get an artery unblocked in Mexico, and they told us he needs to change his diet method and try to eat more healthy. We were told that part of his heart ""died"" and that we were lucky he hasn't suffered a heart attack.

Too much sodium,"I have been told that carbs/sodium bloat you quite a bit so i've been experimenting low carbs to see if it fixes any issues and I was eating a keto based diet of around ~20g carbs a day with fairly high protein and fat.

Didn't really seem to fix the problem and my face is still kinda bloat even though i'm 5'11/155kg, so then I looked into how much sodium I was eating and it comes to around 6g salt/2400mg sodium which I know isn't as way over the top but I still wanna cut it down to like 1000mg sodium as i'm sedentary for now.

So i've looked only at the supermarkets and it's kinda catch22 as it seems like if I was to eat low salt by buying non breaded fish/chicken I literally need to eat so much of it to even hit 1500calories, and it just seems like I need to eat tons of salt to hit calories and it's annoying me as I really wanna cut down but I don't wanna be eating 800calories a day on fresh fish/chicken etc.

Anyone got any suggestions on what low sodium foods I can eat to hit calories? Thanks.

Soybean Oil Is More Obesogenic and Diabetogenic than Coconut Oil and Fructose in Mouse: Potential Role for the Liver,"**Soybean Oil Is More Obesogenic and Diabetogenic than Coconut Oil and Fructose in Mouse: Potential Role for the Liver**

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132672

&gt;Abstract

&gt;The obesity epidemic in the U.S. has led to extensive research into potential contributing dietary factors, especially fat and fructose. Recently, increased consumption of soybean oil, which is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has been proposed to play a causal role in the epidemic. Here, we designed a series of four isocaloric diets (HFD, SO-HFD, F-HFD, F-SO-HFD) to investigate the effects of saturated versus unsaturated fat, as well as fructose, on obesity and diabetes. C57/BL6 male mice fed a diet moderately high in fat from coconut oil and soybean oil (SO-HFD, 40% kcal total fat) showed statistically significant increases in weight gain, adiposity, diabetes, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared to mice on a diet consisting primarily of coconut oil (HFD). They also had fatty livers with hepatocyte ballooning and very large lipid droplets as well as shorter colonic crypt length. While the high fructose diet (F-HFD) did not cause as much obesity or diabetes as SO-HFD, it did cause rectal prolapse and a very fatty liver, but no balloon injury. The coconut oil diet (with or without fructose) increased spleen weight while fructose in the presence of soybean oil increased kidney weight. Metabolomics analysis of the liver showed an increased accumulation of PUFAs and their metabolites as well as γ-tocopherol, but a decrease in cholesterol in SO-HFD. Liver transcriptomics analysis revealed a global dysregulation of cytochrome P450 (Cyp) genes in SO-HFD versus HFD livers, most notably in the Cyp3a and Cyp2c families. Other genes involved in obesity (e.g., Cidec, Cd36), diabetes (Igfbp1), inflammation (Cd63), mitochondrial function (Pdk4) and cancer (H19) were also upregulated by the soybean oil diet. Taken together, our results indicate that in mice a diet high in soybean oil is more detrimental to metabolic health than a diet high in fructose or coconut oil.

I'm devouring fruit! Can't get enough! What gives?,"Quick note: I've taken a huge liking to learning about nutrition as a hobby and I have a lot to learn. Your insight is much appreciated!

So, about me: Started keto in 2016. Dropped 30lbs in 7 months. Stuck to a general ""low carb"" way of eating after but weight stuck around. I was eating terribly and calling it keto. So much processed food, extreme amount of cheeses and sausage and protein cookies and sugar free treats. I was done feeling sick. Right after July 4th I started meal planning. I ditched everything processed. I've reintroduced fruit and higher carb veggies. I feel amazing. This is sustainable!

I'm a little wary that i'm only enjoying it for that sweet, sweet sugar... but from a nutritional standpoint, perhaps my body craves it because it has something I need? I don't know much about fruit :(

I usually limit it to local produce (texas watermelons... holy mother of god) and avoid juice. I also avoid processed sugars, so fruit is really the only sweet I have on the daily.

The Rabbit Hole,"Nutrition is a rabbit hole. While peak nutrition is lusted after by many the definition of peak nutrition and how to achieve it will always be mired in myriad opinions that conflict, combat and contradict one another. As one who was previously obsessed with finding an ideal ""nutrition"" that would be the be-all, end-all to health, happiness and longevity I will now be the first to admit that lusting after this ideal will only exacerbate your problems while causing a variety of stresses that really don't need to be had. 

What's more is that while this reddit community has been AMAZING in fostering a great culture regardless of nutritional belief and practice (plant-based, vegan, keto, paleo, intermittent fasting, etc.), there are millions out there who fail to engage in constructive, meaningful dialogue when it comes to differing nutritional views and research. This often leads to mass confusion yo-yoing between a multitude of diets while pulling the mind and body in too many different directions. 

So here's my advice: stay away from the dangerous dive down the nutritional rabbit hole if you can. I became obsessed and took it to an extreme and am suffering the consequences. 

Find what you enjoy and stick to it. Feel best when you follow paleo? Great! Do it! Does a Mediterranean Diet suit you better? Awesome! Go for it!

Protein Absorption from Liquid Source - How Much?,"Hi Guys

I've been lifting for about 3 years, but have decided to take it a bit more seriously in terms of diet recently.

I've worked out my macros, and decided i need a hell of a lot more protein as i'm training hard but barely making any gains.

I upped my protein shakes, as this is usually a good start, 2 scoops per shake, about 20g per scoop, so that's 40g per serving, in 500 ml water.

GF is a nurse, and says that the body can only take in nutrients from 125ml of fluid at a time (experience from how they feed patients on the wards) - so 375ml of protein filled water is being wasted - so she's suggested lots of protein ""shots"" - smaller amounts more often.

I'm fairly sure this is not correct, as most guys with good bodies have been downing protein packed shakes for years, and with a google search there's barely any evidence to back up her theory. I'm thinking protein absorption and feeding a sick guy liquid nutrients are completely different things.

Does anyone have any actual science to prove, or disprove what she's saying? Am i best to go 2 shakes a day with 2 scoops in each, 4 shakes with 1 scoop, or several smaller amounts of fluid with higher protein amount? Does protein from a liquid source differ from a solid in terms of absorption? How can i maximise the amount of protein i'm taking in from my shakes?",nutrition,1533114381,R00n35p15m,4,2,True,2018-08-01

"How detrimental is a ""high"" sodium intake? + a couple of other questions","When I mean high, I mean over the RDA of 2300mg (mostly from pink himalayan salt, soy sauce, spice mixes, etc).

I am trying to eat healthy and also get my family to eat healthier meals, but my parents who are from Bangladesh are very accustomed to traditional meals which are very high in salt. It tastes amazing, so anything that tastes a little less flavourful becomes almost unpalatable. I myself am having a hard time making my own meals without adding a bunch of soy sauce to make it taste better.

So if my diet is otherwise healthy, with very limited processed/fast foods, does salt intake really matter that much?

What' the Macronutrient-ratio at which calories are burned at different intensities and workout lengths?,"What I mean by this is: If you for example take a brisk walk, how much of the calories you initially (later/much later) burn from different macronutrients?

So if you walk briskly for 20 minutes - does ur body only use ur glycogen stores? Or does ur body already use ""some"" of ur body fat right from the get go? 

I'd imagine initially one would use like 90-95% glycogen and 5-10% fat...and the longer one ""exercises"" (if u can call ""walking"" exercise haha) and the lower one's glycogen stores become the less glycogen/carbs will be used and the more the body will adjust and use more fat. I'd also suppose that on intense exercise the body just uses carbs/glycogen cuz its better for atp generation.

I'm mostly asking cuz the way the different macronutrients are burned could give insights to optimal dietary ""carb:fat ratio"" intake.

I don't wear the fat on my face or arms at all but I have a bit of a belly going. After 5 years I started going to the gym again on Monday. I wasn't sure if I should cut down the fat first or just go ahead and bulk up. I ended up deciding to just lift, eat and bulk because I'm not noticeably big with a shirt on.

However, today I got blood test results back and I have high cholesterol.

At a loss on nutrition,"Hey. So, I’m 31 years old, 5’7” and weight about 152 lbs. I need someone(s) to talk through this with me - I’m feel like I’m at a crossroads and I don’t know if I need to be or not.

I typically lift (heavy? I guess? What qualifies as heavy?) weight 3x a week - I haven’t been doing much cardio. I don’t like cardio. Lately I’ve added in a yoga class and a barre class 1x a week each and I’m trying to up my NEAT. I would say I tolerate to like lifting - I really enjoy taking classes like yoga/barre/spin. I feel like I’ve put on a good amount of muscle but definitely have some fat to lose - around 145 would be where I feel good in my clothes and should be maintainable for me based on past experience. 

I have been tracking macros off and on since 2015ish (with the help of first, a “coach” and for the past year, a registered dietician who’s great). The thing is, I’m so burned out. All I think about is food - and I’m still not being consistent or making great choices. I really am not happy with how I look. I’m afraid, though, that the food tracking and being unhappy and feeling guilty is hindering me. So, the question is - do I give myself a break from tracking food? Do I just go back to CICO? I don’t think IE and wanting to lose weight can be reconciled? I don’t know. I think I’m at information overload and I’m too scared to make a move. 

I think tracking calories would feel more reasonable because after working with my RD, I have a muuuch better idea of how to balance protein/fat/carbs and I’m much more focused on eating “whole” foods most of the time.

If you stuck with this steam of consciousness, thank you and I’m looking for any insight or suggestions you may have. ",nutrition,1529290430,carebearcares,0,1,True,2018-06-17

Prediabetes and exercise,"Hello,

I've been prediabetic for a few years now. As a result, I decided to take initiative by changing my diet cutting the amount of carbs I eat and unnecessary sugars. In addition to that, I also exercise quite frequently by doing cardio about 3 times a week and weight training 5 times a week. Before, I was diagnosed with prediabetes I was already a pretty thin guy weighing at around 160-170 pounds at most at 5'10. However, since the diet change and increase in exercise I lost a lot of weight, weighing around 149 pounds. I feel great but don't look so great. My face looks really skinny due to the recent loss in fat. Any recommendations on how I can look good while feeling good?

Advice Needed: Does pink beef have less fat than well done beef?,"My fiance has had gastritis for years. He is having awful stomach pains right now, and we think it's his gallbladder, due to his symptoms and family history.

I'm wondering if this may explain a strange symptom of his he has had for years that I have never heard of before: whenever there is any pink in his beef, he gets sick. When I tried to research it, I could not find anyone else with that problem because all the articles were about red meat in general, the dangers of undercooked meat, or people saying well done meat is awful. So what I'm wondering is what is the difference between pink and well done beef? Is there a difference in fat content, or any other nutritional difference that could cause him to get sick?

Vegan friend has gone too far,"My best friend became a vegetarian 2 years ago, and as of the past year he was transitioned to a Vegan diet. I have some serious concerns about his health. In this period, he has gone from 175 pounds to 130 pounds. He was an average build 5'10, and now looks emaciated and ill. When he started the diet, I told him he would really need to be on top of his diet if he was going to be vegetarian as its hard to get everything you need. 

Slowly but surely, he has looked progressively worse. He trys to make claims like he was ""flushing out the toxins"" but we all know that isn't true. I have tried to have serious conversations with him about how I don't want him to take it so far and get sick from it and he gets all emotional because he has bought into so much. Its impossible to have a positive conversations about it because he is so emotionally invested. I really don't have any reservations about a vegan diet, I just want my friend to be healthy.

People might think, ""Why do you care about his diet so much?"" and I really didn't care at first. Yeah it sucked we didn't get to go out and eat as much, but it wasn't a big deal until recently. I told him that 130 is not a healthy weight for someone who is 5'10. That isn't even healthy for a Woman of the same height.

He is always tired, thinks he can ""hack"" his sleep and sleep 4 hours a night, but has to take stimulants all the time to stay awake. 

His mental function has taken a dive. It takes him much longer to process information and to understand me in our conversations. My family, who hasn't seen him in a few years told me how they noticed that my friend wasn't able to hold conversations with him without him losing focus. Even they noticed that he wasn't as sharp as last time they saw him.

We were talking a few weeks ago, and he told me that 130 isn't even skinny for 5'10. I looked at him in awe and told him that 130 at 5'10 is beyond skinny and is not healthy. Its not like he is a long distance athlete, he is relatively sedentary. 

What do I do? If he doesn't do something soon, I am pretty sure he will be in a hospital for some untreated condition eventually, but I keep trying to steer him, its going to mess up our friendship.

The Collapse of a $40 Million Nutrition Science Crusade,"This is a recent Wired piece on NuSi and its recent troubles. Here's a link to the article](https://www.wired.com/story/how-a-dollar40-million-nutrition-science-crusade-fell-apart) and an excerpt:

&gt;It’s still too soon to assess what NuSI has added to the nutrition science canon. Results from the two outstanding NuSI-backed studies are due later this year. The fourth and largest one, conducted at Stanford, randomized 600 overweight-to-obese subjects into low-fat versus low-carb diets for a year and looked at whether or not their weight loss could be explained by their metabolism or their DNA. Published this February in JAMA,the study found no differences between the two diets and no meaningful relationship between weight loss and insulin secretion. The most significant finding was that it’s hard to stick to a diet for a whole year.

&gt;Obesity docs like Yoni Freedhoff, a professor of family medicine at the University of Ottawa, aren’t surprised that NuSI hasn’t sparked an epistemological revolution. “From the outset, their approach was simply that knowledge will be enough to drive behavior,” says Freedhoff, who has argued that efforts to prove one diet is better than another does a disservice to patients by implying there’s only one right way to lose weight. He’d love to see research dollars be spent instead on studying how to improve adherence to different eating strategies.",nutrition,1529388680,dreiter,9,5,True,2018-06-19

Tips for Avoiding Sugary Snacks at Work?,"As a quick precursor, obesity runs in my family. My metabolism takes its sweet time and falling off the nutrition wagon has drastic consequences VERY quickly. This is not an excuse, simply a lead up. 

I work out 4-5 days a week, try to eat whole foods the vast majority of the time and don’t allow sugary foods in my house. I have yo-yo’d for years however, and it has everything to do with nutrition and my weaknesses. 

Sugar is my vice. As mentioned above, I don’t have it in my house, however my workplace is another matter entirely. At a minimum of 4 days a week there are donuts, timbits (essentially donut holes for you non Canadians), freshly baked cookies, muffins, strudel, and anything else you can think of, in our staff kitchen for all staff.

It is incredibly difficult to walk past this 10+ times a day (I have to pass through the kitchen to get to other areas) without caving. Once I cave, it’s a downward spiral. After caving too many times, I give up on eating well entirely until I am sick of my own bullshit excuses and start all over again. 

Does anyone else face similar difficulties with staying on track? Any tips to help get past this, other than simply willpower, which I apparently lack?

Why aren't AGEs more of a concern - why isn't there more publicity/nutritional awareness of the risks of AGEs forming both through cooking, types of food and also education on the internal glycation process - i.e. eating fats, proteins and carbs together will exacerabte the process?

Am I right in thinking that the only way to limit/reduce your internal exposure to AGEs is to either either a high fat, low carb diet (e.g. ketogenic diet), or a high carb, low fat diet so that glycation is limited.",nutrition,1529473673,bachus2015,12,16,True,2018-06-20

"""Raise insulin – gain weight. No insulin – lose weight"", so what happens to all the calories in the food we eat?","I'm not disputing anything, just looking for clarification on the effects of insulin on the digestive system. The quote in the title is from [this article](https://idmprogram.com/a-short-primer-on-how-to-lose-weight/), the full quote is below.

From what I understand, insulin plays a big role in fat storage and usage: when insulin levels are high, energy is preserved and fat is stored in the body; low levels of insulin, on the other hand, are a signal to burn glycogen and use body fat for energy. For this reason, someone might say that ""a calorie is not a calorie"" when it comes to weight management, because eating 100 calories' worth of soda will raise insulin more than 100 calories from vegetables, and will result in more body fat.

My questions are:

1. When somebody with persistently low levels of insulin (type 1 diabetes) eats a ton of high calorie food and still doesn't gain weight, what is happening in the digestive system for the energy stored in the food to not be ""absorbed"" – is the food simply not being processed efficiently?
2. Now consider the opposite – someone with chronically high levels of insulin. If they were to stop eating, they would still not burn much of their body fat or lose weight, yet normal functioning still requires energy. Where does this energy come from? I'm guessing the metabolic system slows down; if this is the case, what are the general health implications?

Rest of the quote from the title:

&gt;Giving people extra insulin leads inevitably to weight gain. In type 1  diabetes, when insulin levels are extremely low, patients lose weight no  matter how many calories they eat. Give insulin – gain weight. No  insulin – lose weight (even to the point of death). The implication is  clear. Insulin causes weight gain. Knowing this is crucial, because if insulin causes weight gain, then losing weight depends upon lowering insulin. But instead, we’ve been told to focus obsessively on calories.",nutrition,1529482559,xanalcohol,26,5,True,2018-06-20
"TDEE calculators say I should eat ~200g of protein or more a day, how?!","So yeah, I'm trying to cut down on weight, mostly doing it by cutting down on calories and skipping breakfest (e.g. intermittent fasting).

I'm a 113kg 180cm overweight dude; calculators say I should eat \~200g protein, \~200g carbs and \~100g of fat a day, at a total of \~2000kcal to be at around a 500kcal deficit.

I'm confused; how am I even supposed to get close to that? If I ate only cottage cheese, I'd reach my calorie goal by only eating cottage cheese, nothing else, to reach my protein goal. If I just ate plain lean chicken breast to get to 200g protein, that'd be around 1000 kcal, 660g - however, where I live (Switzerland), meat is prohibitively expensive compared to other foods; I'd pay nearly 15 bucks each day JUST for the chicken itself, which isn't too great, as I am a student on a limited budget. I COULD eat Magerquark; a kilo of it every day, to half the need for something like chicken to only around 300g. But Magerquark plain is barely eatable without mixing it with something; especially not in those quantities.

Eggs would also work more or less; although if I ate 750 of them, for 100g of protein, I'd already be at half my calorie goal.

Is there any other high-protein, low-calorie food that isn't animal based that is able to be bought cheaply? Is the 200g protein 'requirement' set too high for a fat guy that just wants to lose weight by eating less?",nutrition,1529486066,nebenbaum,16,2,True,2018-06-20

Optimal Fasting timing to eat the MOST in one sitting?,"OK, so sort of astray from the usual questions here but I'm hoping this is the right place.

So, this restaurant near my place makes a damn nasty good plate of nachos. Like award winning good. They're delicious as heck, man.

My issue is that I can't physically consume an entire pan of nachos by mysel in one sitting (it's about at 12-14 inch pan of nachos), but I WANT to.

Sometimes I dream about eating these nachos. There just so good that I want to keep going even when I can't.

OK exposition aside, basically I wanted to know if there was any info on the length of fasting required to hit optimal hunger levels, without going overboard. Basically, if I skipped breakfast and lunch one day, I could say that for supper I would want to eat a larger amount of food than usual, but if I tasted for too long my appetite would regulate and actually decrease (that's my own thoughts, anyway).

And while I used to be horrible at all this (about 3 weeks to a month ago I stopped overeating and started tracking calories, as well as moving my diet from mostly carbs and cheeses to what it is now) I have recently started drinking water, frequently, throughout the day (instead of soda like I used to). I have often drank as much as 9 cups of water in a day, but I have never got to my potassium goal for a given day.

Low carb diet seems to be causing low blood sugar and or insulin resistance.,"So I'm about a month in of close to zero carb and I'm doing well. One problem I have is after I eat I tend to get hypoglycemic. I'm not diabetic, I'm very thin and have a high metabolism. I think I'm just very glucose sensitive and or insulin resistant. I've had a sweet tooth all my life and it's probably catching up with me. I had blood tests done and I was ""fine"" (while eating a high carb diet). I think I'm one of those people that still gets symptoms despite having 'okay' stats.

About an hour or two after I eat I get symptoms like a light headache, moodiness, fatigue, blurry vision, pain, rapid heartbeat, carb cravings, and more. I'm doing everything correctly but I still seem to have these issues. The keto flu is long gone and electrolytes are good, but I still have this weird response.  I have to stress that’s it’s not electrolytes because I take them everyday. Things seem to have gotten worse after starting keto. My blood sugar levels tank when I go very low carb. (I don't count carbs but the only ones I get would be from vegis) Especially late at night I get more symptoms. 

Things that help: Apple cider vinegar, vitamin c, and maybe turmeric. Coconut oil seems to make it worse, but I need it because it helps with energy and calms down my hunger. Eating less helps but then I feel like I’m not getting enough calories and this makes things worse in the long run. I've read that having 3 meals a day (instead of more small meals) can help decrease blood sugar/insulin response, which doesn't make sense because after a big meal is when I get the worst response. 

Maybe it will just take time for my body to adjust. Does anyone have any experience with this?",nutrition,1529605491,Sheepsaysmoo,51,19,True,2018-06-21

I don't think this salt substitution chart is correct...,"salt chart: https://www.mortonsalt.com/article/salt-conversion-chart/

I have only table salt with iodide. I bought this because previously most of the salt in my diet was coming from food seasoned with garlic salt and then I realized that the salt in my garlic salt probably doesn't contain iodide and it ""is a necessary nutrient"" and all that so... anyways.

I sweat a lot today and was craving a gatorade but didn't want to have to make a special trip so I googled how to make my own so I'd know the proper amount of salt to add. I happened upon this recipe: https://www.onegoodthingbyjillee.com/2012/04/make-your-own-homemade-gatorade.html''

I completely glossed over the fact that it says kosher salt and did not make the connection that I was going to have a bad time. As I was adding 1/4 cup of iodized table salt to the single quart of liquid I thought to my self ... this seems like way too much salt. I took a small sip, sure enough -- way too salty, like probably would cause you medical issues if you drank the whole thing.

Not wanting my concoction to go to waste, I diluted it making the total volume about 2 quarts. I taste it again, still seems a little too salty but it is drinkable. I take about 2 or 3 swallows and set it down, and a few minutes later I began to get a headache.

None of the comments on that page where I found the homebrew sports drink recipe mentioned it being too much salt and nobody cautioned not to use table salt... hmm.

I looked up that salt equivalency chart to see how far I was off and apparently not much. It says that 1/4 cup of table salt may be substituted for a 1/4 cup and tablespoon of kosher salt, but I'm not sure that is right. It seems much more like 1:2 to 1:2.5, not 1:1.25. It even says that sea salt is more or less equivalent to fine table salt which does not seem correct to me, but surely a company like Morton knows their salt?

Low energy switching from pescatarian to vegan diet,"I’ve been pescatarian for ~ 4 years but for the past few months my diet has been mostly vegan. I say mostly because I occasionally use mayo and other sauces that are left in my fridge that aren’t vegan but I don’t consume any animal products (meat or dairy) otherwise.

There is also different version of baking cocoa which is again 12g carbs and taste is pretty much the same for me.

(vegan) keto for endurance rides?,"
i've just started going on long distance bike rides and i'm getting really sick of having to fuel up every 45 minutes. i'd rather have a bigger recovery meal after that i actually enjoy because eating while riding isn't fun at all for me and really doesn't agree with me.

i recently watched a video about an ultramarathoner who claims to be ""fat adapted"" and because he burns purely fat for energy during his runs he can tap into his fat stores without having to fuel on carbohydrates and thus doesn't have to regularly fuel himself. this got me thinking about whether if i could fat adapt my body for my rides and thus not have to constantly refuel because i fucking hate it.
does anyone know if this is possible or just a load of bollocks like most of what ketogenetic dieters come up with?

this is kinda difficult to me because due to my ethical principles i'm not going to step outside of a vegan diet (i also want to minimize my risk for cancer, heart disease, diabetes). but i'm willing to try out vegan keto if it improves my cycling performance and have an open mind to it.

Help. A Healthy Diet Without Vegetables?,"I love vegetables. I want to eat them. I used to eat them all the time. I just can't digest them anymore.  Everytime I start a diet with veggies (broccoli, spinach, radishes, peppers, cucumbers, avocado...etc) I get very sick. My guts bloat and swell with gas within 45 minutes of eating them. Doesn't matter if it's a little or a lot. 

Then the gas comes out. It smells so horrible. It's humiliating.  It's gross. It makes me feel disgusting.  Also the whole thing is very painful. I went through pelvic surgery in March, and the bloating seems to hurt more now post op. But I've had this issue for the last few years. 

It seems like the veggies just sit in my guts, undigested, rot, and create gas. 

Is there a way to eat healthy and just avoid vegetables?  The only veggies that don't give me gas are red potatoes. No idea why. So i do eat those. 

Also, as far as I can tell..... fruit (which yeah I know some of the ""vegetables"" like peppers, avocado, and cucumbers are fruit)... does not cause this issue. Standard fruits like watermelon, strawberries, blueberries... no issues. 

But I know fruits like those are high in sugar. Wasn't sure if it was ok to just eat fruit with a meal instead. I need to get my nutrients somehow. 

The other issue is I cannot digest milk or milk based creams, or most cheeses. (Also no ice cream. Sucks.) I do drink plain almond milk quite a bit. And Greek yogurt doesn't trigger issues. 

And I do not eat red meats, partially because I don't like it, but mostly because colon cancer is hereditary in my family. And I have the same nasty reaction to soy (tofu, edamame, etc) as I do to milk and veggies. 

I want to eat healthy, but all I end up eating is Greek yogurt, watermelon, and salmon or lean turkey. I dunno. I need variety.

"How much/little does it matter I hit the exact macros each day? If my desired TDEE is at 2200 and protein intake around 130g, and I’m not trying to be a bodybuilder, is it still okay to hit like 2000 calories and 110 protein one day, maybe 2425 calories and 142 protein the next day?","I’m 4 months into a program and seeing results, so it’s not because I’m particular lacking results I’m asking, I have been rather nitpicking these couple of months and maybe want to do it more relaxed and causally now that I know what most foods consist of. 

I know there’s good tools like MyFitnessPal to track your complete macro and calorie intake each day, but my work schedule is often pretty inconsistent, also some days I have to stay awake longer than other days, and I’m finally hitting a sweet spot where I prep most of my meals plan and somewhat know what they consist of. So my question is like how much does it actually matter if I casually just want to get in shape and such? If I eat the right kind of diet and is inbetween - + 200 calories of my TDEE and +- 20-30 grams of protein? 

It’s not getting difficult I say but I’m hitting that spot now where my beer belly is starting to disappear and my noob gains are going strong, but measuring my food as much as I do know is rather time consuming and I’m not going for a competition or anything else. So while I’m style working on getting lean, is it hurtful to eat +200 calories more one day or will it barely be noticeable? I don’t think it count as much as long as I eat the right stuff and consistently doing gym-related stuff, I just want to make sure I’m not doing anything against the agenda, these 4 months have been okay, but I think I’m educated enough know to be more relaxed and less strict about exact calorie intake for each day.

Creatinine levels,"Hello all,
So, I've been to the doctors for a few weeks now getting various blood tests completed. I'm  5'8"", 185lbs, about 12% body fat, 25  year old Male that's been working out for a few years now. I have always been on supplements and havent put much thought into them as far as the negative effects go. I think it's because I just haven't needed to because I was younger. Specifically one year ago my creatinine level was In the normal range. So, i continued to take gold standard protein, C4 prework, and Creatine monohtdrate. My calorie intake goal was about 2400 calories as I was trying to maintain my body weight with 50% carbs, 30% protein, and 20% fat. But this is where I need help. when I got my blood results back this time my creatinine level was high. Around 1.45. It should be below 1.3 and above .9. My doctor was not happy with the results and lectured me about how poorly manufactured protein is the cause of this and I need to be more careful about my supplements because this can cause kidney Damage. So, we did an experiment and I simply got off all supplements and took a week off of working out. Apparently too much physical stress can also spike creatinine levels. After just one week my creatinine level was down to 1.21. The doctor was glad that it was going down but said a guy my age and activity level should be below 1.0 creatine level. But my doctor wasn't able to reccomend me a good brand of protein or what to look out for that raises your creatinine level. The doctor said I needed to do my own research and this is where I'm starting.

Could use some advice -- Gut Health and Skin Relation,"Hi,

I have had problems with acne for the past few years. I recently tried not eating dairy as it has always given me some problems with stomach pain and made my skin oily. After a month, I had pretty much no active acne, so the improvements were immense.

However, now I think that more was at work than just a dairy-less diet. I was off of work since the start of summer (when I started not eating dairy), so my life was very stress-free. 

But now I started a new job recently, and I'll admit I was very nervous for it and when I get nervous I get really bad butterflies in my stomach and I think I possible over produce stomach acid. I was having trouble eating as I would want to vomit the second the food hit my stomach. I lost a few pounds and was having stomach issues from being nervous/anxious for probably 3-4 days straight. 

I'm doing better now as far as stress, but my skin is not. I broke out badly during those few days where I was nervous and had stomach pain. Now I am putting the pieces of the puzzle together and it seems that my acne has not been due to dairy so much as just stomach issues in general. 

I have spent the whole summer trying really hard to fix my skin from the outside through topical products, which were working up until I broke out, but now I think its time to try fixing my skin from the inside. It seems that no matter how much progress I make with skincare products, the acne always lingers so this may be the only way to fix it. 

Basically, my stomach is seemingly the root of my issues, so I would like some advice. Has anyone else dealt with acne issues related to stomach issues? What helped you? What is happening in the stomach when your skin breaks out? Too much bad bacteria -- or not enough good bacteria? Should I see a doctor of some sort to get details on whether something else is causing problems in my stomach?

Nutritional label changes - carb question,"My favorite microwave dinner (UK) just underwent an upgrade and some aspects of the nutritional information changed. The meal itself is salmon in watercress sauce with potatoes, broccoli, and green beans. Overall, looking at the label it seems the sauce was made richer and the ratio of salmon to potatoes was changed a little. Here is the label/ingredients of the old version:

My question is: What happened to the carbs? I don't have a background in nutrition, but a 4% decrease in the amount of potatoes does not substantiate nearly a 50% cut in the total carbs. It looks like some of the carbs might have moved into the fiber count (??), but even then there are still some ""missing"" bearing in mind the percentages (if the package is 385g, wouldn't there be at least 22g of carbs from the 127g of potatoes alone?).

Is extreme hunger and an urge to overeat the body's natural response to calorie restriction?,"I'm in recovery from an eating disorder that caused me to lose a lot of weight (75 lbs) over the last year. Even though I'm  no longer restricting my intake I feel like my hunger is out of whack. Even after I just finished a meal I will often get intense hunger pangs. Other times I will not feel any hunger at all until I actually start to eat. And even scarier, sometimes I will get urges to binge and eat an entire box of cereal, for instance, or a whole pizza. I never give in to these impulses, but they still freak me out.

I'm currently seeing a dietician as part of my recovery process and she says that extreme hunger is a natural response by the body to extended energy deprivation, and that I should listen to my hunger signals and give in to the urges because ""my body knows what it wants."" And that the extra food Is needed to ""repair the damage I did to myself"" Is this true? She's an rd so she should know what she's talking about and I would normally be inclined to trust her, but on the other hand I feel like she's  just trying to say whatever to get me to eat more food (I'm already eating a 500 calorie surplus).

"Which is the biggest dietary contribution to atherosclerosis - n-6 PUFAs, AGEs, refined sugar, fats in general or something else?","There always seems to be frequent debate on here over a variety of dietary issues and at times it feels as though the only *safe* things to eat that won't contribute to atherosclerosis/CVD are vegetables and leafy veg. But where is the fun in that.

So what, in your opinion is the **main** contributory cause of atherosclerosis (artery plaque) and CVD development in diet?

* AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-Products) - i.e. the products formed through cooking food at too high a temperature, and also formed in the body through the combination of fats/protein and blood sugar. AGEs are linked with CVD and cell damage.

* Omega 6 PUFAs - inflammatory fatty acids which are easily susceptible to oxidation, encourage cell damage and are linked with a variety of inflammation-related diseases such as CVD and cancer.

* Refined sugars - create inflammation through increasing blood sugar spikes and insulin response, which over time lead to other ailments and diseases.

* High consumption of fat and specifically high saturated fat intake - yes I know this is a more 'traditional' way of thinking often disputed and dismissed, but nonetheless it is still mentioned as a factor by many today.

* Something else?

Did the introduction of industrial oils/refined sugar really lead to a significant increase in CVD? What did people eat pre-industrial oil/refined sugar?,"I read quite frequently that CVD and disease in general sky-rocketed in the 20th Century, coinciding with the advent of refined sugar and industrial oils being added to foods along with preservatives, artificial ingredient, GMOs, pesticides etc.

I think it's fair to assume that at least one of those items on that list are probably responsible for many diseases today in the western world.

I also read that prior to all of the above i.e. prior to the 20th Century, heart disease was near enough non-existent in the western world.

Part of me thinks that this was due to health records being less stringent, less conclusive causes of death recorded and autopsies/actual internal analysis of the causes of death were much less frequently conducted and diseases less accurately diagnosed than they are today.

Another part of me thinks that perhaps it was just a cleaner diet without industrial oils/refined sugars/GMOs/preservatives/pesticides etc.

So I'd like to ask two things.....

* Prior to the introduction of industrial oils/refined sugars/GMOs etc what kinds of food did people eat?

* Did the introduction of industrial oils/refined sugars/GMOs really result in a significant increase in CVD and other diseases, or is it purely that diagnosis and recording of the causes of disease/death was much more efficient in the 20th Century and beyond?",nutrition,1530151129,bachus2015,25,78,True,2018-06-27

I asked this community about psyllium a while ago and I came back with a personal feedback after trying them.,"It’s been over a week since I posted a question about psyllium (seeds or powder)

I mostly received positive feedback but there were also people who said it made them even more constipated. 

I have IBS and severe constipation frequently so I ran out of options to ‘cure’ my ‘poop game’. 

I will tell you what I tried and how I got rid of constipation. Remember, everyone is different so be sure to check your health status before trying anything on your own. 

- I tried psyllium seeds

at that time, I couldn’t find any powder, as many of you tried here. So I had to use the seeds. 

- Use tiny tiny amounts

In order to get rid of constipation, I made a room temperature shake containing - 1/2 lemon, 1/2 teaspoon psyllium seeds and about 1/2 tsp of honey. You can adapt the shake based on your own tastes. 

In about an hour, I went to the bathroom. After one week of being constipated and literally in pain. My stomach was huge and bloated before. 

Advantages noticed:

- I did  not get cramps 
I expected pain after a week of not going to the bathroom. Instead, It went naturally. 

- You don’t poop everything at once so you don’t force or iritate your colon to ‘push’ everything all of a sudden. 

- overall I formed a reflex of going to bathroom daily, even if it’s ‘not much’.  (But I consume psyllium daily in order to keep this ‘reflex’). 

What others said would happen but it didn’t in my case:

- I didn’t get more constipated. In fact, it helps you go to the bathroom if you use it correctly. 


My advice: (as I said, consult your health before trying anything)

- If you are constipated, make a shake as recommended before and drink it at night, but not immediately after you eat. Do it About 1-2 hour *after* your last meal. And after that, you shouldn’t eat anything at all. Drink that and calm down for a few minutes. I recommend you to also do small physical movements. Personally I just cleaned the room a bit. It’s important to move your body. It helps with digestion. 

- Drink lots of water daily. It depends of your location but if you are somewhere where it’s super hot anyway, you should also drink more than 2 liters/day. Water helps a lot.



If you don’t go to the bathroom that night, repeat in the morning with that ‘shake’ but be sure to have time for bathroom and not be stressed with work’s morning rush. Try it on a weekend maybe. 

Overall, I am impressed with the results even though I did not use psyllium powder (as some recommended). Seeds were as good. 

And because I don’t always have time to drink my shake peacefully, I include psyllium seeds in my salads aswell. But again, tiny amounts. 

The average recommended amount is 10-30 grams maximum/day. I use about 10 grams/day for now and it works great in my case. 

Good luck and I hope you will solve your issues

Are chia seeds' nutrients only absorbed if they are chewed/ground before swallowing?,"When I eat chia seeds, I usually soak them in water and drink the whole thing. The thing is, they seem to come out whole in the toilet. Given the jelly coat of fiber they get when soaked in water, i'm guessing that coat kind of protects the seeds while in the digestive system. (Well, even if I didn't soak them in water, they'd still develop the jelly while in the intestines becayse theyd be surrounded in water)

So, doesn't this mean that everything people say about chia seeds being a good source of fatty acids and magnesium and stuff shouldn't be true? Since we can't absorb them anyway? In this case, the only real benefit we are getting should be the fiber as it helps us keep our bowels clean. It's quite a waste considering how expensive these seeds are.

Given the above is true, I see two solutions. Chewing, or grinding. Well, chewing doesnt work for me because the my teeth dont meet seamlessly so the seeds just hide in the gaps. I don't have a grinder yet, but I may invest in one if they will help me get the most out of my chia seeds.

"How can protein, fat, and carbs all be assumed to be the same number of calories?","It was determined many years ago that 1 gram of fat is 9 calories. And 1 gram of carbs is 4 calories. And 1 gram of protein is 4 calories. That's considered the factual standard behind calculating calories.

I know those are rounded numbers, as I'm sure if you look at the study that determined these I'm sure it wasn't a clean 9, 4, and 4. I'm sure there were some decimal points in there that got rounded.

My question is, is it safe to assume that all fat, protein and carbs are created equally when it comes to calories?

For example, on a molecular level, the fat in duck fat is different from canola oil and from the fat in butter, right? If you were to extract 1 pure gram of fat from duck fat, butter and canola oil, would each be 9 calories (or really, really close to 9 calories)?

What about 1 pure gram of protein from a bean compared to pure gram of protein from beef? And 1 pure gram of carb from cow's milk to 1 pure gram of carb from wheat to 1 pure gram of carb from corn syrup? Are they all really close to 4 calories?

I am a 23 year old 6’1 female and weight about 260lbs..I have been overweight for as long as i can remember. My biggest struggle is my relationship with food. I have lost weight before, and i always gain it right back. I can stay strict with a diet, but as soon as i start to stray away and eat things (especially fast food) that aren’t diet/weight loss friendly, it’s like i just can’t stop. I have no self control. 

After graduating high school, i decided to start Weight Watchers. Over the course of about a year, i had lost 50 pounds and was feeling great. Then i got too comfortable with it, also was in a new relationship where all our dates involved food and i gained it all back. 

In October 2017, i started keto. I was strict on staying under the 20-25 carbs each day until about Christmas. I was doing intermittent fasting and that was working great too, it was easy and i felt like it really helped me understand that food is fuel and not just entertainment, something for when I’m bored, etc. By this time i had lost about 30 pounds. I ate Whataburger (Texans know) one time and instantly gained 4 pounds by the next day. I figured it wouldn’t be that hard to lose that 4 pounds again and so i went off keto for awhile. Only to weigh in later and realize i had gained pretty much all 30 pounds back. 

At this point, I’m lost about what i should be doing. I don’t know if keto is the right move for me, or if i should just a stick to a healthier low fat/high carb diet. Keto was great, but even eating too many “healthy” carbs made me gain weight and it scares me because i don’t plan on being keto forever. I do not want to lose more weight, just to gain it all back while i am trying to maintain. I guess at this point I’m just wondering what i should be focused on for losing weight and keeping it off?

How to eat more fiber?,"Good afternoon fellow redditors of r/nutrition 

Recently, I’ve started to weight-lift. It was suggested to me that I should keep track of my macronutrients/ calories and I have. I have been logging my macros into the app MyFitnessPal for a little under 2 months now. Since using the app I have noticed I barely meet the fiber goal which is 38g daily. 

I started looking into this and I found out most foods “high” in fiber barely have 4-5g of fiber per serving and are usually heavy in carbs. My daily calorie goal is 2,100 kcal so I was thinking, “how am I supposed to get 38g of fiber when my calories are limited?” 

So how am I? Most of the calories are used up by protein and on a normal day I eat around 2 slices of whole wheat bread/ maybe an apple, whole wheat rice. At the end of the day my calories from carbs are at around 150-170 and my fiber from those foods comes out to around 15grams of fiber (my 2 servings of protein have 4 total g of fiber) 

Considering my max carb intake is 193 and now I get 170 and I barely get 15-17max g of fiber how am I supposed to meet the daily recommendations for fiber? 

Currently I’ve been eating so much fiber from outside sources (the thingies you sprinkle in foods) which is how I’ve been getting the 38g of fiber but I’m not sure if doing that on a daily basis is healthy. ",nutrition,1530241895,SpikeX23,10,5,True,2018-06-28

I'm not sure how healthy it is though, it is largely centered around beans, which I've heard some people say is not healthy. The diet is:

MWF

1 cup dry black beans (whatever the equivalent volume of cooked beans is)

1 cup cottage cheese

1 cup dry kidney beans

1 serving (140cal) chicken meatballs or chicken sausage

 2 potatos

1 serving of whatever fruit or vegetable I have

T/TH

1 cup dry black beans (whatever the equivalent volume of cooked beans is)

1 cup cottage cheese

600 cal vegetable speghetti

2 servings  vegetable pasta sauce

1 serving (140cal) chicken meatballs or chicken sausage

100 cal Parmesan cheese

1 potato

Sa/Su

Whatever I want but still avoid desert type foods

Do you guys have any good intuitive explanations for what makes processed foods 'bad',"I hear it all the time, and I pretty much believe it, that certain modern foods are like 'toxins' they are 'overly processed' and full of 'unnatural ingredients'...  


When I have cut these foods out, the stuff that sits on shelves for months without deteriorating, the sugar the white flour I do lose weight and feel better.

But what I'm searching for is an intuitive scientific reason \*why\* these foods are so bad. When people call them toxic or artificial they just seem like another way to say 'don't eat this' but I don't have a gut feeling about the \*why\*.

Why would easily processed carbohydrates or white sugar or doughnuts etc. be bad for the body. If they contain calories and are easy to eat shouldn't that be good for the body? Why would we have evolved in such a way that food with long ingredient lists are worse for us than 'whole foods' ?

Acute effects of smoking the occasional (&lt;10 times/year) cigar. How badly am I harming my body and the environment?,"Background:
Overall I eat fairly well. I try to stick to organic food as much as possible. I focus on eating a ton of veggies and mainly lean meats. I limit my carb intake to whole organic grains and organic fruits mainly. I keep my carb intake a little lighter unless I'm planning on upcoming longer cardio activity.


For training I mainly power/Olympic lift (2-3 days/week), and do light cardio (2-3 mile runs 5-7 days/week) for exercise.

I'm not training for anything. I just focus on trying to stay healthy and work on life longevity, setting myself up to live a decent/comfortable life (I'm 26). I also am trying to take more of a world conservation viewpoint, working on recycling a lot more and not using plastics as often, and as I said trying to eat organic whenever I can.

Now for the immediate question. I like to enjoy the occasional cigar for celebratory or just relaxing purposes. I have a cigar and some bourbon and hang out on a weekend evening listening to music and take the night to appreciate life and the moment. How negatively is this occasional activity affecting: 
A- My long term health
B- What are the acute effects on my body and my diet/workout plan?
C- How bad is this for the environment?

Astaxanthin is a carotenoid antioxidant (free radical scavenger). Due to its chemical structure, it can never act as a pro-oxidant under any condition, unlike other compounds like Vitamin C.

Since reactive oxygen species / free radicals are an inherent feature of mitochondrial respiration, would their scavenging by Astaxanthin reduce mitochondrial respiration (ATP production)?

&gt;**Conclusion**  
&gt;  
&gt;The food industry and legislators who prefer less regulation will likely  oppose these proposals, so health-minded advocates and legislators will  need to advocate vigorously for robust measures that support healthier  diets. Although evidence regarding the effects of these proposed  approaches on health outcomes is not yet available, emerging data show  improvements in diet quality for some of these strategies. Given the  substantial effects that diet has on chronic diseases, an ambitious,  multipronged effort to reshape the food environment so that healthy  foods are readily accessible and exposure to unhealthy foods is limited  is worthy of much greater public investment and advocacy.

Fast food making me healthier??,"I started off college eating very healthy and working out, but in my later years I ran out of time and patience. I began to eat almost exclusively fast food, while working out at a very minimal level. I remember thinking I shouldn't be eating so much fast food, but it was just so good, cheap *and convenient*!

Soon, however, I started losing weight, feeling better, and looking better. I went from about 190 lbs. down to 150-155 lbs. I was by far the leanest I had ever been, and had more muscle definition(*6 pack!*)than ever.

I was still worried about eating so much fast food though, so I stopped eating fast food almost entirely, and  started making home-cooked meals. I gained ~60 pounds in 3 months.

I leveled out at around 210 lbs. for awhile, but I started to develop high blood pressure; however, due to some stressful times I started eating mostly fast food again, and I have aleady lost 10 pounds in just over a week. My blood pressure is significantly lower too.

NEW 30 Day Challenge - Vegan Nutrition Plan,"Hello r/nutrition!

This month I decided to challenge myself: A 30 Day Vegan Meal plan.

I wanted to address the topic of muscle building while on a vegan diet. Recently this past month, I put together a meal plan for myself that outlines specific amino acids in my diet. I plan to experiment for 30 days the effects of being on a strict vegan diet while training. From my own observation, my opinion is that there is a need for education relating to a vegan's approach toward athletic performance.

For disclosure, I am not a registered dietician or physician, but do believe in holistic health, overall wellness and longevity. From my experience dieting as an athlete, my own perspective has been shaped by the process of dieting for muscle growth and how to achieve optimal physical conditioning.

As defined animal protein is noted as a '**complete protei**n', as it contains all of the essential amino acids that your body needs to function effectively ([https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/animal-vs-plant-protein](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/animal-vs-plant-protein)). These six are [arginine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine), [cysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine), [glycine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycine), [glutamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamine), [proline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline), and [tyrosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine) (i.e., R C G Q P Y). Five amino acids are **dispensable** in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These five are [alanine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine), [aspartic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_acid), [asparagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagine), [glutamic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid) and [serine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine) (i.e., A D N E S).([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential\_amino\_acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid)). Furthermore, each type of animal protein is made up of varying percentages of these types of amino acids ([http://www.jbc.org/content/148/2/431.full.pdf](http://www.jbc.org/content/148/2/431.full.pdf)). In other words, animal protein is made up of varying amino acids, but will contain all of the essential amino acids for muscular regeneration.

For vegans however, plants are '**incomplete'** and do not contain all of our essential amino acids. Hence, plant variety is required to intake the requisite amino acids for muscular growth.

Currently, as a vegetarian, I have had great results with (1) a leaner, more structured muscular tone; (2) less body inflammation; (3) a comparative strength profile; and (4) a quicker recovery period.

Before I began this challenge, I analyzed my prior diet and researched the amino acid percentages of a moderate, animal-based protein regimen. In theory, this animal-based diet requires consuming high amounts of protein to maximize muscle recovery during post-athletic performance.

Next, I totaled the amino acid profiles derived from each animal-based meal. This becomes a benchmark for my protein intake while training for these next 30 days.

My analysis and amino acid profiling begins as follows:

1. Determine my total amino acid intake on an animal-based approach
2. Calculate my **total milligram (mg)** intake per amino acid for the day
3. Substitute in my vegan-based diet plan
4. Calculate my amino acid profile for my vegan-based diet plan
5. Compare both profiles and see where I am deficient in amino acids (in milligrams) compared to my previous animal-based diet
6. Target specific plant-based food types that make-up for those deficiencies

Once I determined the correct food groups, it became a matter or adjusting my diet accordingly.

I expect my challenge to last from 7/1 until 7/31 this month and I just wanted to post a current picture of my physique here in order to keep myself accountable for the next 30 days.

Also, I have attached my current vegan diet plan to this post, and would be grateful to hear any feedback. GDrive for Meal Plan: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xWzLPQzTclCgv6mnnm-JEmZaobN\_tdbp](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xWzLPQzTclCgv6mnnm-JEmZaobN_tdbp)

I'm already taking 5.000 IU of D3 + K2 MK7 200µg and 25mg Zinc Bisglycinate (been low on both). I've also started taking Magnesium citrate recently (690mg - 100mg elemental Magnesium) but I dunno if this is an adequate amount? I'm not doing any sports if that matters.

Blood test regarding Iron and Selenium came back with the following results:

Ferritin: 60 ng/ml
Selenium: 79 µg/l

I'm not sure on how much I should supplement (or whether at all) since supplementing either too much seems to be harmful according to the info I could gather. I'd like to get into a sort of mid-range on most stuff and both of these seem to be rather low-end.

I was thinking about supplementing 100µg of Selenium but still clueless on the Iron. RDA of Iron seems to be around 8mg in my case but most Iron supplements start at like 18mg.

Keto and kidney stones,"Female, 5'5, 190lb, recent kidney stone problems, very little activity since switch to desk job.

So I have recently had problems with kidney stones, I had to have one removed, it wasn't that big but the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder is very small so it wouldn't pass on its own. I had to have a stent for 2 weeks to try to expand the tube and an additional week for it to heal around it. I was pretty much in bed for 3 weeks due to the pain. I don't want to go through this again.

Getting to the point: I would like to get back into keto, but have heard about possible kidney stone problems in relation to this. I have done extensive research (not a lot out there I could find) and realize that it's the increase in protein that can cause stones. I have found that it SHOULD be ok as long as you don't eat too much protein, but if you have stone history then you can't cheat, because the sudden spike in glucose from carbs can cause stones as well.

Looking for help with diet/fitness advice,"I’m reaching a point of utter frustration and looking for some help.  I’ve got a serious need to lose weight, but can’t find a workable and effective approach.  I’m 43, and weigh 300 lbs.  I’m relatively muscular.  My ideal body size is probably in the 230’s somewhere.  I recently (April) went to the local university and had a body composition test done, so I ‘know’ that I’m roughly 33% bodyfat and 67% lbm.  My RMR is ~2400 calories, and my TDEE is ~3400/day (I’ve verified this by constantly wearing a Fitbit, and seeing my TDEE stay between 3100 on really sedentary days to 4000+ on days where I get in some good exercise).  

I’m about 20lbs under my highest weight, but can’t reliably lose weight. I bounce around within the same 7-8 pound range seemingly no matter what I do.  The only approach I have seen work in recent memory was doing a whole 30 diet about 2 years ago. I lost 18lbs that month, but it all came back over the course of a year.  

As far as exercise, I only really do a couple of things. I lift, and I love lifting.  I bike, and love being out on my bike.  I have an Airdyne, and toss that in every once in a while too.  

My current approach to my diet is very low-carb, high protein.  Carbs typically account for 15% or less of my calorie intake during the day.  I look for protein to take up at least 40%, letting fat take up the rest.  As I understand it, that’s not a true keto split because the protein is too high.  So I’m worried that that may be a problem.  I’m also trying intermittent fasting, with a window of 11a to 7p each day.  I allow myself one cheat meal a week as well.  

Now, I know there are problems with how I’m implementing.  In the three weeks I’ve been trying IF, I’ve been inconsistent.  I travel a lot and getting solid meals in is sometimes difficult.  So I’ve watched my calorie intake bounce around between 1100 to 2800 a day.  I never go over, but I’ve frequently been under.  On travel days, trying to get in the calories usually means I blow past my carb limits (it’s easy to pile on calories with protein bars, etc that have 25+ carbs apiece).  When I’m short on cals, it kills my workouts, it seems, and I’m generally fatigued.   I’ve also had real difficulty sleeping, especially when on the road.  At this point, I’m delighted to get 6.5 hours in a night. 

All in all, things are a mess, and I’m looking for suggestions:

1.	Do I need to switch up my macro breakdown?
2.	Is IF right for me, or should I allow myself a larger feeding window to get in all the calories?
3.	Suggestions for calorie dense, but properly split (p/c/f) transportable snacks?
4.	Any other thoughts to help an aging fat guy shed serious weight before it kills or cripples him?

Low glycemic is fattening?,"I just saw a picture (I’ve screenshotted it but can’t upload it here? ) and an article from gorillaprotein.com that says that going low glycemic isn’t good for loosing weight because according to the glycemic index a carrot is more “fattening” than fudge and that’s why it’s bogus and you should go vegan. But isn’t the low glycemic diet based on the glycemic load in the food? Like a carrot might have “high” glycemic index but how many carrots are you gonna eat? In an entire dish of wok I put maybe 2-3 carrots? And I don’t eat the entire thing in one setting  hats maybe 4-5 meals. And one large carrots glycemic load is 2 , with low starting at less than 50. So basically they didn’t do research or worse they’re deliberately avoiding this easily googleable fact and trying to push whatever they feel is better.

Simple homemade sandwiches - good macros?,"I'm just wondering about making my own sandwich for lunch everyday as it seems like a very affordable, and relatively nutritious option, yet it almost never seems to be mentioned as a staple in the fitness world.

Assuming you can get some good quality, lean turkey lunch meat (organic), that's about 8-9 grams of protein per ounce of meat.

So I have been stacking my sandwiches high with 2 slices of ciabatta bread (~250 calories), 6 ounces of roasted turkey breast (250 calories), some light mayo (3 tablespoons, 100 calories) and cheese (2 slices, 180 calories).

A relatively simple and ubiquitous turkey and cheese sandwich, but it gives me everything I need (750 calories, macros are ~75 protein, 25 fat, 75 carb). And I'll throw in a cup of fruit on the side just for some more fiber and micronutrients.

All in all, this is a meal that takes literally a minute to prepare, no cooking is required, there's practically no clean up, and all of the ingredients are readily available and affordable.

Child vs adult nutrition,"I was just reading that thread about the parent who had a daughter that loves croissants and people were saying the problem with croissants is that they are empty calories. Is it necessarily bad for a child to consume empty calories that they enjoy, considering they are growing? Maybe I’m overestimating the rate at which they are growing, but don’t children need a lot of fuel in general to grow their bones, muscles, organs etc.? 

One problem with just feeding children healthy foods is that often these foods are really low calorie based on volume, and children have smaller stomachs and don’t like to just sit around and eat. Obviously you don’t want your children to be vitamin deficient, but is there anything wrong with giving kids stuff like biscuits or croissants or doughy, carby snacks that they enjoy and provide the calories they need to grow? I’m thinking of trying to feed a kid that’s entering puberty healthy foods like beans and vegetables and he’d have to sit there all day eating just to get the calories in. 

Also I’m not a parent so I could be way wrong about how many calories kids need. ",nutrition,1530729688,WhatsHappening123456,30,68,True,2018-07-04

"My Vitamin D tablets state that each tablet has 1000 IU of Vitamin D, and instructs to take one a day, but in general the recommended amount per day for an adult is 2000 IU?","According to Google, the average adult should get 2000 IU worth of Vitamin D per day (and even more if you get relatively little sun exposure). The ""relatively little sun exposure"" definitely applies to me (I'm a programmer and I'm almost always inside). 

I've heard that foods contain relatively little amounts of vitamin D, and that's why we need to get most of it through sunlight and tablets (I live up north so sunlight is scarcer here than if you were closer to the equator, doctors here tell almost everyone to take vitamin D). 

So should I be taking two pills a day instead of just one? I realize that vitamin D is one of the few fat soluble vitamins, meaning that I have a higher chance of overdosing on it than other vitamins. Not sure exactly what taking too much would do to me, but I don't wanna find out haha. 

**TLDR** I'm probably not getting 1000 IU of Vitamin D just through daily food and sunlight, should I take two tablets a day (1000 IU each) of Vitamin D, instead of one tablet a day like it instructs?

Blood sugar levels normalization time,"Hello

I am currently taking some supplements which effectiveness is reduced by high blood sugar levels, therefore I need to take them once my blood sugar is stabilized or is low. I am not diabetic.

1) I am wondering after eating a meal, how many hours have to pass before your blood sugar levels normalize? Is it 2 hours? 3? or more?

2) Does the blood sugar level decay time is impacted by the type of food you eat? For ex. if I eat some snacks or sugary food, does that mean that my blood sugar will still decay at the same time if I ate healthy dinner? Or would it take longer?

3) Related to the 2nd question - what about drinks? I heard that soda raises your blood sugar levels very fast, but does it take the same time to have blood sugar level normalized as with solid foods?

4) Does water help to lower blood sugar level? How long would it take to have blood sugar level lowered after drinking 2-3 cups of water during the meal?

Thank you.

- timing of my meals. I have a bad habit of snacking at night, but I know if I go to bed on a full stomach, I’ll wake up with a horrible stomachache that lasts the whole next day. I have a hard time figuring out when I should eat dinner so I a) don’t fall asleep with a full stomach and b) don’t eat too early and get hungry before bed, leading me to snack and repeating the cycle of feeling sick the following morning. 

-I follow a mostly vegan diet (I slip up with dairy sometimes, but working on it), and I also workout 5 days a week (lifting/Crossfit). I usually eat meat replacements, but I know those are not great for you, what should I eat instead that is filling but not super carb heavy, since that tends to make me tired and groggy?

The reason as to why normal cheese and dairy is less than ideal still eludes me. Since I’ve been reading that dietary cholesterol and fat don’t influence blood cholesterol as much as we previously thought. When I comes to dairy I’m virtually illiterate. 

The reason I mention normal cheese is because in the little research I did on the Daiya cheese and dairy alternatives, I found that there isn’t really a different other than the dairy presence, nutritionally.

Swedish study shows 44% reduced fatty liver after 2 weeks of low carb eating,"[An Integrated Understanding of the Rapid
Metabolic Benefits of a Carbohydrate-Restricted
Diet on Hepatic Steatosis in Humans](http://cyber.sci-hub.tw/MTAuMTAxNi9qLmNtZXQuMjAxOC4wMS4wMDU=/mardinoglu2018.pdf#page=1&amp;zoom=auto,-17,783)

&gt;Highlights

&gt;- A low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) improves liver fat metabolism
in NAFLD patients
- The LCD promotes rapid shifts in the gut microbiota
composition of NAFLD patients
- The LCD-induced microbial changes are associated with
increased circulating folate
- The LCD increases folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism
gene expression in liver

&gt;SUMMARY

&gt;A carbohydrate-restricted diet is a widely recommended
intervention for non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), but a systematic perspective
on the multiple benefits of this diet is lacking.
Here, we performed a short-term intervention with
an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased
protein content in obese subjects with NAFLD
and characterized the resulting alterations in metabolism
and the gut microbiota using a multi-omics
approach. We observed rapid and dramatic
reductions of liver fat and other cardiometabolic
risk factors paralleled by (1) marked decreases in
hepatic de novo lipogenesis; (2) large increases in
serum b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, reflecting
increased mitochondrial b-oxidation; and (3) rapid
increases in folate-producing Streptococcus and
serum folate concentrations. Liver transcriptomic
analysis on biopsy samples from a second cohort
revealed downregulation of the fatty acid synthesis
pathway and upregulation of folate-mediated onecarbon
metabolism and fatty acid oxidation pathways.
Our results highlight the potential of exploring
diet-microbiota interactions for treating NAFLD.

Are Vitamin Daily Values Accurate?,"Sometimes I find myself in a loop of researching how many vitamins we're supposed to get. It's like a spider web of different foods and percentages, and it's all very confusing. I end up doing a bunch of math in my head only to realize that it's pretty much impossible to get enough of everything.

For Example: I was looking into Zinc recently. I don't think I've ever had a day's worth of Zinc throughout my entire life. What little I might eat of the foods that contain it, it's certainly not 100% daily. It's probably not even 50%. Soybeans are the only thing that can give a decent amount of it, and I don't think I've even had a soybean. I've never had lamb or pumpkin seeds.

Do you really need 100% daily value of vitamins? 

It seems literally impossible unless you're eating like 3,000 calories a day. Imagine trying to make sure you get enough Vitamin D, Zinc, Omega 3 and other vitamins on a 1,500-2,000 calorie diet. You'd have to find super rich foods in those vitamins and make sure you eat the same thing every day as if it was a formula to make sure you're getting enough.

As someone that has LITERALLY lived off of fast food and junk food my entire life, and then lost 50 pounds while eating more ""semi-junk"" like hot pockets and lean cuisines, I'm trying to improve my diet. My hair has been frizzy and falling out for the past few years, and I'm trying to fix it. I suppose my diet hasn't been the best. Trying to figure out which foods I need to eat in order to get all of these random vitamins makes me feel like I'm doing algebra.",nutrition,1526728215,smarky93,7,23,True,2018-05-19

How much meat is too much meat? Can eating a lot of fruits and vegetables offset the negative effects of excess meat?,"I'm in my mid 30s now and becoming concerned about heart health since heart disease is what kills most of my family members, including one only in his 50s. They were all old school, zero exercise, cigarette &amp; cigar smoking, steak and potatoes Midwesterners, which makes me feel a little bit better, but I'm still concerned my meat habit will overshadow anything else I eat. 

I cook for my fiancee and I most nights. Unless I'm cooking something special, my go to recipe is pan seared meat (I rotate between chicken breasts, bone in pork chops, steak, and cod) and sauteed vegetables (typically green beans, asparagus, carrots or Brussels sprouts). 

**Is this too much meat for good heart health?**

I also eat a shitload of raw vegetables and fruit (mostly in the form of salad but sometimes I'll just get a bag of pre cut green beans or something like that and eat them like a bag of chips (my mom is a health nut and raised me veggie heavy, so I genuinely enjoy these foods; but I genuinely enjoy everything for the most part). 

It's difficult to find nutrition advice you know you can trust. I feel like I can easily go find 10 articles in 10 min that say meat is awesome because it's high protein and low carb and 10 that say it's what's wrong with humanity.

Negative effect of vitamin D on kidney function: a Mendelian randomization study | Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation,"[https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance\-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfy074/4985804](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ndt/gfy074/4985804)

## Abstract

**Background**

The  kidney plays a central role in the regulation of vitamin D metabolism.  It is not clear, however, whether vitamin D influences kidney function.  Previous studies have reported conflicting results, which may have been  influenced by reverse causation and residual confounding. We conducted a  Mendelian randomization \(MR\) study to obtain unconfounded estimates of  the association between genetically instrumented vitamin D metabolites  and estimated glomerular filtration rate \(eGFR\) as well as the urinary  albumin:creatinine ratio \(UACR\).

**Methods**

We  performed a two\-sample MR study based on three single nucleotide  variants associated with 25\(OH\)D levels: rs2282679, rs10741657 and  rs12785878, related to the genes *GC*, CYP2R1 and DHCR7,  respectively. Estimates of the allele\-dependent effects on serum  25\(OH\)D and eGFR/UACR were obtained from summary statistics of published  genome\-wide association meta\-analyses. Additionally, we performed a  one\-sample MR analysis for both 25\(OH\)D and 1,25\(OH\)2 D using individual\-level data from six cohorts*.***

**Results**

The combined MR estimate supported a negative causal effect of log transformed 25\(OH\)D on log transformed eGFR \(*β* =  −0.013, P = 0.003\). The analysis of individual\-level data confirmed the  main findings and also revealed a significant association of 1,25\(OH\)2 D on eGF*R* \(β = −0.094,  P = 0.008\). These results show that a 10&amp;#37; increase in serum 25\(OH\)D  levels causes a 0.3&amp;#37; decrease in eGFR. There was no effect of 25\(OH\)D on * *UACR \(β = 0.032, P = 0.265\).

**Conclusion**

Our  study suggests that circulating vitamin D metabolite levels are  negatively associated with eGFR. Further studies are needed to elucidate  the underlying mechanisms.",nutrition,1526823311,AcceptableCause,2,1,True,2018-05-20

Questions about daily protein intake,"Let me preface by saying that I lift 3 days a week and play basketball during the days that I'm not lifting. So I'm pretty active and am currently trying to build muscle. 

So, how much protein should I be eating daily?

I've heard many different answers to this question and just want some general clarification.

What I've been sticking with lately is the claim that 1g/lb is the upper limit of the recommended amount of protein intake daily, while some say that this is bad for the kidneys and recommend 1g/kg. Others say that 1g per pound of lean mass is the correct amount. Which, if any, is correct? I'm just trying to protect my organs and get my gains, yaknow?

Another question I have is how many grams should I limit myself to per serving? And how long should I wait before my next protein meal? Or does it not matter? I've heard that if you eat too much at a time or don't wait long enough between high protein meals that you just poop the protein right out. I've also heard that this is a myth.

Glycemic load vs Glycemic index?,"So if I'm understanding correctly, glycemic index is calculated by taking into account 50g of a certain carbohydrate relative to glucose. But in a lot of instances, you're eating more of a certain food than something else. So for example, although a watermelon and a donut have the same GI, you're not going to be eating the same amount of both of these foods. If you ate 50g of watermelon and 50g of donuts, it would raise your blood glucose levels by the same amount. Therefore, glycemic load would be a more accurate metric because it takes into account how much you're actually eating

Does Protein have a Glycogen Reserve equivalent?,"Hey r/nutrition,

Something recently came to my mind. From my understanding, once we have a meal, the glycogen reserves are filled up, which then provide easy to access energy. So if I consume, for example, a very caloric dense meal, with a big amount of carbohydrates, it will take quite some time for them to be completely used (disregarding strenuous cardio activities).

This brings me to my question. Does something similar happen with protein? i.e., if I eat 400g of protein (3 days worth of macros) in a meal (for example, a BBQ party), does this mean I can go on for 3 days consuming 0g of protein and still be able to properly repair and grow muscle?",nutrition,1526848200,spicegaming,20,7,True,2018-05-20

What's your opinion of TMAO and its relation to health?,"I've come across TMAO several times in my research, most recently in Michael Pollan's book ""In Defense of Food."" He explains that when we eat animal products that contain choline or L\-carnitine, some people have bacteria that convert those into TMA, which is subsequently turned into TMAO in the liver. TMAO has been shown in several studies to be a direct indicator of increased risk heart disease. Essentially the more of it you have in your body, the greater your risk of hear disease. 

Can TMAO be tested for in the blood? How do you feel about it and do you consider it something to be concerned about? Is it a valid reason to remove animal products from the diet? 

If you think the links between TMAO and heart disease are bullshit, it would be great if you could cite a scientific study that actually shows that. Too often I notice on this sub that people love to trash things without actually backing up their claims with anything.

&gt;Abstract

&gt;This study was conceived to evaluate the effects of three different diets on body composition, metabolic parameters and serum oxidative status. We enrolled three groups of healthy men (omnivores, vegetarians and vegans) with similar age, weight and BMI and we observed a significant decrease in muscle mass index and lean body mass in vegan compared to vegetarian and omnivore groups, and higher serum homocysteine levels in vegetarians and vegans compared to omnivores. We studied whether serum from omnivore, vegetarian and vegan subjects affected oxidative stress, growth and differentiation of both cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2 and H‐H9c2 (H9c2 treated with H2O2 to induce oxidative damage). We demonstrated that vegan sera treatment of both H9c2 and H‐H9c2 cells induced an increase of TBARS values and cell death and a decrease of free NO2‐ compared to vegetarian and omnivorous sera. Afterwards, we investigated the protective effects of vegan, vegetarian and omnivore sera on the morphological changes induced by H2O2 in H9c2 cell line. We showed that the omnivorous sera had major antioxidant and differentiation properties compared to vegetarian and vegan sera. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the three different groups of sera on MAPKs pathway and our data suggested that ERK expression increased in H‐H9c2 cells treated with vegetarian and vegan sera and could promote cell death. 

&gt;The results obtained in this study demonstrated that restrictive vegan diet could not prevent the onset of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases nor protect by oxidative damage.

Working out fasted vs non-fasted,"I posted this in r/naturalbodybuilding first, but that seems to be a relatively slow place, so I'll try posting here instead. This is what's on my mind:

In addition, I went on for longer than I had planned, so after a while, my stomach made me aware that it would have liked some raisins \(though I don't think my energy level was low, I felt quite good\). This made me think about whether it's supposed to be destructive to continue the session \(lasting a few hours in total\) if your stomach starts feeling empty halfway through the workout. Not catastrophically empty, just... enough to notice it. I have come across assertions, according to which doing this IS bad, but then there are those who work out fasted.

So were the figs dried? or candied. \(candied is a preservation method of coating the fruit with granulated sugar\) They did not look glossy like candied fruit does.

Eating *Raw Garlic* almost Daily.. Could not do it / Bear it! --- Cooked Garlic still just as good?,"Eating *Raw Garlic* almost Daily.. Could not do it / Bear it! --- Cooked Garlic still just as good?

Dear fellow /Nutrition redditors...

I was following all the websites and data and sourced materials of proving the daily or every two days, consumption of raw garlic, of its amazing health benefits.

BUT. I could not bear the taste. It was unpallatable and unedible, and left my stomach twisting and contorting and I felt miserable.

I would chop up / chunk up / mince / garlic press, 2 to 3 to 4 ""smaller"" sized cloves of once of organic garlic ( these are smaller size than your normal convention huge garlic cloves from all natural garlic, because they're organic.)

I would have a higher concentration of store bought, red pepper hummus, aka red peppers and spices and oil and hummus and seasonings. There would be a lot more hummus compared to the organic raw garlic. I would also add olive oil too, and mix it all up.

The taste during chewing and eating, and the after taste, was unbearable. It is simply unedible and I cannot do it or refuse to do it. I think an option I didnt try yet it only eating 1 tiny small raw clove at a time.

Also previously the first time ever, I tried eating raw garlic like a piece of fruit or apple, of eating it straight up.

So the question still stands:

Can garlic have the same health effects, if its lightly cooked on the stove top? I have organic raw garlic chopped up, and add pasture raised butter and iodized salt and pepper and lightly cook it for a while on the stove so that its not so fully raw.

Daily egg consumption may reduce cardiovascular disease - Having an egg a day could reduce risk of stroke by 26 percent,"Article:

 [Daily egg consumption may reduce cardiovascular disease - Having an egg a day could reduce risk of stroke by 26 percent](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180521184702.htm)
&gt;People who consume an egg a day could significantly reduce their risk of cardiovascular diseases compared with eating no eggs, suggests a study carried out in China, published in the journal Heart.

Study: 

[Associations of egg consumption with cardiovascular disease in a cohort study of 0.5 million Chinese adults](http://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2018/04/17/heartjnl-2017-312651)

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Objective To examine the associations between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD), ischaemic heart disease (IHD), major coronary events (MCE), haemorrhagic stroke as well as ischaemic stroke.

&gt;Methods 

&gt;During 2004–2008, over 0.5 million adults aged 30–79 years were recruited from 10 diverse survey sites in China. Participants were asked about the frequency of egg consumption and were followed up via linkages to multiple registries and active investigation. Among 461 213 participants free of prior cancer, CVD and diabetes, a total of 83 977 CVD incident cases and 9985 CVD deaths were documented, as well as 5103 MCE. Stratified Cox regression was performed to yield adjusted hazard ratios for CVD endpoints associated with egg consumption.

&gt;Results 

&gt;At baseline, 13.1% of participants reported daily consumption (usual amount 0.76 egg/day) and 9.1% reported never or very rare consumption (usual amount 0.29 egg/day). Compared with non-consumers, daily egg consumption was associated with lower risk of CVD (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.92). Corresponding multivariate-adjusted HRs (95% CI) for IHD, MCE, haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke were 0.88 (0.84 to 0.93), 0.86 (0.76 to 0.97), 0.74 (0.67 to 0.82) and 0.90 (0.85 to 0.95), respectively. There were significant dose-response relationships of egg consumption with morbidity of all CVD endpoints (P for linear trend &lt;0.05). Daily consumers also had an 18% lower risk of CVD death and a 28% lower risk of haemorrhagic stroke death compared to non-consumers.

&gt;Conclusion 

&gt;Among Chinese adults, a moderate level of egg consumption (up to &lt;1 egg/day) was significantly associated with lower risk of CVD, largely independent of other risk factors.",nutrition,1527144968,1345834,0,1,True,2018-05-24

But I prefer to use it on the armpits and groin area as they seem to be the sweat producing areas on the body for us.

And further more the toothpastes we use too, they are packaged with flavour substances,fluoride(if you've done some research on the pituitary gland you know this is harmful), sodium lauryl sulphate and many more preservatives.

10 Health Benefits Of Eating Nuts,"# 10 HEALTH BENEFITS OF EATING NUTS

📷

## 1. Nuts are packed with antioxidants

Every dietary plant contains many different types of antioxidants. They are molecules that defend our cells from damage caused by oxidant by\-products, for example – free radicals. Stress, excessive sun exposure, and pollution are some of the reasons why free radicals are formed in our body. Antioxidants bind to these unstable by\-products and deactivate them. [\(1\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249911/)[\(2\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18044138) Cellular impairment causes aging, cancer and a variety of diseases. Eating a small handful of nuts can help reduce the oxidative damage. [\(3\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106921)The highest contents of antioxidants are in walnuts, chestnuts, and pecans.

## 2. Brain food

Nuts are nutrient dense fruits with ample amounts of healthy \(unsaturated\) fatty acids, that are linked to lower rates of dementia due to Alzheimer’s Disease, improved thinking and memory. Walnuts, pine nut, pecan, macadamia, hazelnut and Brazil nut contain more fats than almonds, cashew nuts, and pistachios. [\(4\)](https://honesthealth365.com/health/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-nuts/#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20benefits%20of%20nuts&amp;f=false)[\(5\)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/boost-your-memory-by-eating-right)📷

## 3.  High content of fiber

Fiber is important because it changes the pace of food movement through the digestive system. It helps our body maintain balanced microbiota – a little \(big!\) community of microorganisms, that live in our gut. If there’s an imbalance in the community – there’s hell to pay in a form of constipation, diarrhea, nausea and many other undesirable effects.Richest in fiber are almonds, followed by pistachios and hazelnuts.

## 4. Nuts are rich in vitamins.

Nuts are a great source of vitamins \(B1, B2, B3, B6, folate, and E\). They also contain a lot of carotenoids, some of which our body converts into vitamin A. This vitamin is essential to vision and normal development. Roasting, however, decreases the amount of vitamin B1, carotenoids and vitamin E, especially in almonds and walnuts. [\(6\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814616316910)

## 📷

## 5. Nuts can help us lose weight

I know how this sounds, especially since I wrote that they’re rich in fats and high in calories! Well, moderation is the key, of course, and – the fact that nuts contain polyunsaturated fats \(the good fat\). The worst fats of all are the trans\-fats \(junk food\) and saturated fats are those that should be eaten in moderation \(bacon \&lt;3 \). So, switching from potato chips to nuts is the logical step.

## 6. Nuts have beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes

The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of four conditions: increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol \(or triglycerides, or both\)and excess body fat around the waist. Together, these conditions increase the risk of stroke, heart disease, and diabetes. There are reports suggesting, that there is an inverse link between eating nuts and type two diabetes, as well as metabolic syndrome, however, these studies call for further focusing on the mechanisms that could play a significant role in the prevention of the mentioned conditions. [\(7\)](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/7/673)

## 📷

## 7. Nuts can reduce inflammation

A study on Mediterranean diet shows that eating nuts improves anti\-inflammatory activity by decreasing certain inflammation markers \(C\-reactive protein and Interleukin\-6\) [\(8\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925270). An exploratory clinical study shows that pistachios help maintain anti\-inflammatory activity, glycemic control, and endothelial function [\(9\)](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-abstract/70/4/234/1937193). Not bad for a nut.

## 8. They won’t break your heart

Nuts decrease oxidized LDL – cholesterol, which means, they protect us from heart diseases [\(3\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106921).  They also raise the concentration of HDL \(good\) cholesterol [\(10\)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24075767).📷

## 9. They prevent anemia

Now we got good blood! It used to be mad love… Sorry, where was I? Nuts are rich in iron, which prevents anemia and carry oxygen to other parts of the body. In one study, the scientists determined the content of iron in nuts and found that cashew nuts are the richest nuts of all. [\(11\)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13197-011-0535-5)

## 10. They simply make you happy

How can we wake people up about their health? (long rant),"Recently, I conducted some basic research on the greatest causes of death in my country (USA) and most of those causes have other causes that lead back to nutrition. 

Now we can't eat perfectly (some may not have enough capital to consistently eat healthy) but it seems like people lack basic knowledge about health &amp; nutrition. 

Everyone knows pizza is bad for you but noone really thinks about why. Our society appears to be more health conscious but in reality we aren't. 

Noone mentions ""Pizza is bad for you because it can cause death"". People just say ""Pizza is bad because it lacks nutrients"". Its like they use soft terms in-order to mask over the real effects of these foods. 

I live in a low to mid class neighborhood (average salary is under 50k a year, school system is terrible) and I walked into a corner store to get some tea. All I seen was death (cigarets, candy, chips, soda, etc and of course the protein bars were $4 each) the interesting part is most people don't understand this (I didnt until recently). These companies would go extinct if people knew how detrimental their products were to their bodies. 

I dont see the harm in getting some ice cream or a pizza once in a while, but masking over the real dangers of bad food is really the leading cause of health problems in our society. If we told everyone ""the ingredients in mcdonalds cheese burgers can eventually lead to an increased risk in heart disease which can lead to death"", most people would now be aware of this fact &amp; if they care about their health, they'd stay away from mcdonalds. 

It comes down to economics (healthier foods are more pricey) but also psychology (people need to understand this stuff). 

ALSO: When people watch the news and see ""man dies from stroke at 65"", they think ""RIP"" but never think about what caused the stroke. Those same people could be eating the same things that the man was eating while watching the news (making them more prone to what happen to the man himself) but the disturbing part is, they dont realize this fact! How can we wake people up to these facts? 

Ps. Im not against happy foods but I believe they should be eaten in moderation. Some might say ""we'll die anyway"" and thats true but why die 60 when you can last until 100 &amp; still feel great? ",nutrition,1527183037,PreciseVii,7,3,True,2018-05-24

Health in the UK,"*Like an idiot, I posted a response to a Reddit advert as it irked me a little. Stating that ""new study finds healthy food cheaper than unhealthy food."" I had seen other adverts with posts in them, so didn't think twice. And just wanted to post my two cents on the advert. Found out I couldn't post my long-ass rant, but didn't want to waste it because the world revolves around me and my Opinion™ matters. Anyway, for better or worse, here it is:*

I mean this is just blatantly untrue. Certainly in the UK, at least. And definitely in Scotland.

For example, while you can buy a banana for 20p, or broccoli/certain vegetables for 40-60p (cheapest), in the very high majority of cases you'll gain far more calories from a 49p packet of Oreos. You can get some packs of cookies for around 20p, too, in budget/value ranges.

These are just snack foods though, so how about proper meals? Well, it is true that you can make a meal relatively cheap (£3.00 for spaghetti Bolognese that could feed 4-6), but the issue is it has to be done in bulk to reduce the per-head value. A major part of the problem occurs with parents/individuals that don't have the knowledge to cook. Convenience will be taken over nourishment. You can get some pretty bad quality food for cheap. Bad quality, not necessarily as in taste but in the contents/nourishment.

To cook healthy meals you need to make larger initial investments, then eat the same thing over the course of a few days (if you're budgeting). Often people might not have enough cash on hand to buy what they need for something healthy. Luxury (using that loosely) ingredients are also additional costs that some people just can't make, e.g.: basil, oregano, wine, tomato paste, salt, pepper, butter for Bolognese. Then there's the quality of a meal. You could use very few ingredients: mince, tinned tomatoes, spaghetti. And that would give you a meal. But with artificial/unhealthy food, these will be more appealing due to the ingredients that bulk up the dish, causing a person to feel more full and will probably taste better.

In the UK, berries are quite expensive: £2.00 for around 150g of raspberries (not a lot). Bags of leafy vegetables can be around £1.00, in most cases. The main problem with all of this is the number of calories in an item.

You can fill up far more on 5x20p packs of cookies than, say, a £1.00 bag of spinach. 

For best calorific value, healthy items are not cheaper. If you're in the UK, just check stuff out next time you're in a shop. You'll likely be aware of it all anyway, but it is really interesting. No child will spend £2.00 on blueberries when they can get juice, crisps and chocolate for less than that price.

I live in Glasgow and there are plenty of areas in poverty here. Child poverty in the UK affects 1/4 children (thought it was 1/6, was wrong!). I'm not preaching, but these are the facts. The funding does not exist to help people eat healthier, certainly not enough to change things. Sugar is also very, very cheap and taxed less than other items...for whatever reason. Political or otherwise.

**TL:DR:** Healthy food is, in the high majority of cases, not as cheap as ""unhealthy"" food. Calorie content in healthy vs. unhealthy food of the same monetary value is also not equal, meaning the feeling of being full will not last when getting nourishment from something healthy.",nutrition,1527189744,Mr_Stormy,4,3,True,2018-05-24

"'The Mediterranean diet is gone': region's children are fattest in Europe - For kids in Greece, Spain and Italy, the Mediterranean diet is dead, according to the World Health Org, which says that children in Sweden are more likely to eat fish, olive oil and tomatoes than those in southern Europe","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/24/the-mediterranean-diet-is-gone-regions-children-are-fattest-in-europe

For kids in Greece, Spain and Italy, the Mediterranean diet is dead, according to the World Health Organisation, which says that children in Sweden are more likely to eat fish, olive oil and tomatoes than those in southern Europe.

In Cyprus, a phenomenal 43% of boys and girls aged nine are either overweight or obese. Greece, Spain and Italy also have rates of over 40%. The Mediterranean countries which gave their name to the famous diet that is supposed to be the healthiest in the world have children with Europe’s biggest weight problem.

Sweets, junk food and sugary drinks have displaced the traditional diet based on fruit and vegetables, fish and olive oil, said Dr Joao Breda, head of the WHO European office for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases.

“The Mediterranean diet for the children in these countries is gone,” he said at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna. “There is no Mediterranean diet any more. Those who are close to the Mediterranean diet are the Swedish kids. The Mediterranean diet is gone and we need to recover it.”

Children in southern Europe are eating few fruit and vegetables and drinking a lot of sugary colas and other sweet beverages, said Breda. They snack. They eat sweets. They consume too much salt, sugar and fat in their food. And they hardly move. “Physical inactivity is one of the issues that is more significant in the southern European countries,” he said. “A man in Crete in the 60s would need 3,500 calories because he was going up and down the mountain.”

The data comes from the Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative of the WHO’s European region, which has been running since 2008 and now involves more than 40 countries that submit weight and height data for their children. The latest figures come from data collected between 2015 and 2017. “It is very high quality data,” said Breda.

Here is a very relevant comment on why meat seems to be important part of a healthy diet (let the downvotes begin):

""I took a Master's level course on this recently and will try to keep it simple.

Probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions can all help, however a reversion back to the mean is usually experienced after the intervention ends. This probably due to people going back to consuming the same diet they used to. So the way you beneficially change your gut microbiota is by making permanent adjustments to your diet.

Despite being populated by countless microbes, there are online a few ""population combinations"" that are common. I won't go through the details of all of them, but one of those populations is defined by the phylum Bacteroides and is commonly found in those that consume a lot of animal fats and proteins.

I didn't go through the paper but from the article it seems that they linked the positive effects to Akkermansia and the Bacteroides phylum. Bacteroides is commonly found in those that eat a lot of meat, and Akkermansia has been shown to increase with higher fibre intake.

From this article it looks like ketogenic diets also improve Akkermansia populations, however it could simply be due to the low carb, high fibre vegetables people consume when doing keto. Although the benefits of having Bacteroides and Akkermansia in the gut have long been associated with good body composition, think this is the first time they were linked with seizure reductions.

Tl;dr if you want a similar gut profile as that in the study you need to make permanent adjustments to your diet where you get plenty of meat and fibre.""",nutrition,1527260867,trwwjtizenketto,1,1,True,2018-05-25

To all of you who think we don't need meat - might be we get every micro and macro from vegetables, but it looks like our gut bacteria that feed on meat are very healthy and can be beneficial for our health - so the discussion is still up in the air!

A comment from the reddit discussion:

""I took a Master's level course on this recently and will try to keep it simple.

Probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions can all help, however a reversion back to the mean is usually experienced after the intervention ends. This probably due to people going back to consuming the same diet they used to. So the way you beneficially change your gut microbiota is by making permanent adjustments to your diet.

Despite being populated by countless microbes, there are online a few ""population combinations"" that are common. I won't go through the details of all of them, but one of those populations is defined by the phylum Bacteroides and is commonly found in those that consume a lot of animal fats and proteins.

I didn't go through the paper but from the article it seems that they linked the positive effects to Akkermansia and the Bacteroides phylum. Bacteroides is commonly found in those that eat a lot of meat, and Akkermansia has been shown to increase with higher fibre intake.

From this article it looks like ketogenic diets also improve Akkermansia populations, however it could simply be due to the low carb, high fibre vegetables people consume when doing keto. Although the benefits of having Bacteroides and Akkermansia in the gut have long been associated with good body composition, think this is the first time they were linked with seizure reductions.

Tl;dr if you want a similar gut profile as that in the study you need to make permanent adjustments to your diet where you get plenty of meat and fibre.""",nutrition,1527261260,trwwjtizenketto,35,90,True,2018-05-25

"Interesting new science: Keto diet may stimulate more water drinking, less alcohol drinking","/x/posting what I wrote on the r/keto subreddit:

I rarely post in this sub but I keep a hobby interest in dietary science. Just saw this new research highlighted in Nature and I thought I'd share:

""The hormone FGF21 (fibroblast growth factor 21) is a major regulator of drinking in mice. FGF21 is produced in the liver and links metabolic status to behavioral responses through actions in the brain. It has many effects on metabolism, including regulation of preference for sugar consumption. Song et al. found that various stresses, such as alcohol consumption or a ketogenic diet, caused increased production of FGF21 and stimulation of water drinking. Although alcohol consumption has well-known acute effects on water balance through inhibition of antidiuretic hormone action, this work shows an important role for FGF21 in stimulating water drinking after alcohol consumption. FGF21 can even suppress preference for alcohol consumption in favor of pure water.

Cell Metab. 10.1016/j.cmet.2018.04.001 (2018)""

If you'd prefer a slightly more technical summary, the abstract from the paper:

""Alcohol and ketogenic diets increase water consumption. Here, we show that the hormone FGF21 is required for this drinking response in mice. Circulating levels of FGF21 are increased by alcohol consumption in humans and by both alcohol and ketogenic diets in mice. Pharmacologic administration of FGF21 stimulates water drinking behavior in mice within 2 hr. Concordantly, mice lacking FGF21 fail to increase water intake in response to either alcohol or a ketogenic diet. The effect of FGF21 on drinking is mediated in part by SIM1-positive neurons of the hypothalamus and is inhibited by β-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Given that FGF21 also is known to suppress alcohol intake in favor of pure water, this work identifies FGF21 as a fundamental neurotropic hormone that governs water balance in response to specific nutrient stresses that can cause dehydration.""

"Calorie restriction or actually NUTRIENT restriction = longevity/ ""fountain of youth""??","Ok, so I was listening to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast the guests name is Peter Attia (#1108) and he mentions the top things that are universally recognized in nutrition to basically prolong life. He cites a study that I have heard of before and maybe you guys can find it where they had 2 groups of monkeys one eating regular calories/food and the other group eating lower calories. Apparently the calorie restriction (eating a pretty low amount of calories say 1500 for guys and 1200 for girls) idea to me, was that eating low calories decreases inflammation and then in turn keeps you younger and healthier i.e. prolongs life. BUT the study that is out there somewhere says that this wasn't the case, the case was that the monkeys that looked healthier and had beautiful fun and youthful energy were actually NUTRIENT deprived COUPLED with calorie restriction and that when you gave them JUST calorie restriction but GOOD nutrients it didn't work. This had me soooo confused and I'm hoping I can talk to some experts here because this seems (to me and my brain) that it justifies eating SHIT garbage food and just making sure your calories are restricted. So all of this trying to eat whole natural plants and mixed veggies and fruits and organic etc etc etc is all bullshit in this study that says just keep calories somewhat low and then avoid nutrients?

Does anyone know of a product that acts as a timed safe that only unlocks for certain portions of the day that I could store tempting food in?,"I realize the idea might seem extreme, but let me explain. 

I try to abide by scheduled meals throughout the day so that I can watch my calorie intake. My solution for abiding by this plan consistently is to avoid buying tempting foods. Unfortunately, there are some consumables I'd still like to purchase for preparing meals, like peanut butter, frozen fruit, honey, and flavored whey protein. My problem is that I find myself snacking on these foods whenever I buy them outside of when I use them in my scheduled meals. So I avoid purchasing them in an effort to keep to my planned meals.

However, I realize that a simple solution to still getting to enjoy these foods is just to restrict my access to them. I'd ideally just put them in a locked container that only opens for say, an hour a day, so that I can grab what I need to prepare my food. That way, when I'm sitting at home and feeling like indulging, there is never any temptation, no matter how bad a craving may get. Do products like this exist?

Ideally, I just need a small container I can store keys in. I can then buy cheap, larger locked boxes for things like frozen fruit, as I'm sure electronic lock boxes wouldn't hold up to the elements of a fridge or freezer. ",nutrition,1527360380,ResilienceTheory,0,1,True,2018-05-26

"Confused about ""starvation mode""","I'm confused about the effects of calorie restriction on metabolism. I've read a lot of studies on the effects of restricting calories and various diets, and it seems fairly clear that the ""starvation mode metabolism"" often touted by bodybuilders and other pseudo-nutritionists doesn't exist; and a few studies I read last week even indicated that severe restriction of calories has little impact on resting metabolism (controlled for body weight), if any. 

That said, about a year ago I decided to cut weight by eating only my BMR plus calculated calories from explicit exercise on that given day (for example, if I burned 300 kcal doing sprints, I'd eat my BMR + 300kcal, and if I didn't do any exercise I'd eat only my BMR). My thought process was that to cut to about 5-6% bf I'd eat only what I needed and continue exercising heavily. Obviously this led to a big deficit in calories. As soon as I took a vacation, and thus a break from planning exactly what I ate, I quickly felt and looked bloated. Afterward, I moved into a transition from cutting to maintaining calories (supposed to be around 3000 per day), but instead I put on weight (visible fat), while exercising and lifting the same if not better. In fact, most of my calculations said I should really be around 3300 cals to maintain, but I ate at 2900(!!) cals as a test, and still gained visible, non-muscle weight. This year, I'm cutting by just taking off 500cals from my BMR+TDEE, without cardio and just heavy lifting, and I'm losing weight at the same rate. But, I'm eating anywhere from 300-600 more calories per day than I was last year. 

I strongly believe in always accepting empirical evidence and dismissing anecdotal evidence, but doesn't this indicate that my metabolism slowed way last year down from eating too little? Any ideas on what could have been happening? ",nutrition,1527438849,raphaelb53,15,1,True,2018-05-27

Why is boiling vegetables so common?,"It's my understanding that boiling vegetables is generally the worst method of cooking vegetables because it causes so much nutrient loss. Steaming, on the other hand, is generally the best. So why do so many people boil vegetables?  


You might think this is a stupid question. After all, there are plenty of less\-than\-optimally\-healthy things people do. But people generally do these things because they are pleasurable or easier than alternative choices in some sense. Steaming vegetables is quicker than boiling them, so even if people are ignorant of or don't care about nutrition I would expect steaming to be much more popular than boiling. Yet, as I see it, boiling is the most common method of cooking vegetables. Why is boiling vegetables so common?",nutrition,1527505449,smallhealth,30,1,True,2018-05-28

"Being overweight likely makes you dumber. As body weight increases patients do worse and worse on learning and memory tests. Obesity also literally shrinks the physical size of the brain, damages the areas used for creativity/imagination, and raises the risk of dementia.","https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/nov/23/obesity-alters-brain-structure-and-function

Cheke has contributed to a small but growing body of evidence showing that obesity is linked to brain shrinkage and memory deficits. This research suggests that obesity may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease.

Surprisingly, it also seems to show that the relationship between obesity and memory is a two-way street: being overweight or obese not only impacts on memory function, but may also affect future eating behaviour by altering our recollections of previous eating experiences.

The link made sense, she says, with some signs that obesity affects areas of the brain known to be used in memory and imagination. In 2010, for instance, researchers at Boston University School of Medicine reported that healthy, middle-aged adults with increased abdominal fat tend to have slightly lower overall brain volume. In particular, the hippocampus, a deep brain structure sometimes called the brain’s printing press thanks to its role learning and memory, was significantly smaller in obese people compared to leaner individuals.

There were also some hints from animal studies. “In studies focusing on weight changes and eating behaviours in rodents, the animals were terrible at learning tasks such as the Morris water maze,” explains Cheke. “The more I looked into it, the more I expected to see memory deficits, but that question was still very much open.”",nutrition,1527531352,Bluest_waters,9,17,True,2018-05-28

During the day I consume:
*1-2 drinkable meals (contains most of what is needed nutrient wise)
*Vitamins and other supplements
*Greens, fruits etc if im feeling peckish

How many calories do I need on top of this?

"Why is all American grown food ""unhealthy""?","It seems like everything mass produced in America is unhealthy, especially the cheap and popular crops. I'll briefly cover some main agricultural products: \(1\) white potatoes, \(2\) corn, \(3\) grains, \(4\) nuts and legumes.

White potatoes \(e.g., Idaho Russet potatoes\) have a high glycemic index and are feared. But you don't see anyone complaining about other tubers, like sweet potatoes or yucca.

Corn is also feared for all kinds of reasons similar to other ""grains"", especially by the Paleo community.

Speaking of grains, all grains grown in the US seem to have some sort of issue associated with them; Texas rices are loaded with arsenic and everyone fears wheat. The rest of our grains such as oats and barley induce gluten scares among lots of people. You have all these Wheat Belly and Grain Brain books which have gained lots of popularity. The ""ancient"" grains, amaranth, millet and teff, however, are quite popular now.

And then we have US nuts and legumes. People fear peanuts for the high omega\-6 fats and virtually zero omega\-3 fats. Speaking of that, basically nothing that is traditionally mass produced in the US has desirable omega\-6/omega\-3 ratio. And soybeans were feared due to claims of endocrine disruptors. On top of this, people fear ""anti\-nutrients"" in nuts and legumes.

So what the heck is up with all of this? Are these ""unhealthy"" crops more easily grown on US soil for some reason? Is the government trying to kill us? Are these health claims being spread to disrupt major businesses? Or is it just trendy to not do what everyone else is doing?

And you also have people like Steven Gundry who claim that there are harmful lectins in most foods, well it just so happens that they are in EVERY SINGLE mass produced American crop! And the Paleo crowd \(who seem like the ""trendy"" crowd\) claim anti\-nutrients in most American crops are bad. Is ""unhealthy"" food easier to grow?

Nutrition and WHEN we eat (not just WHAT we eat),"Jason Fung has a new blog post up summarizing research into meal timing, and again pointing out how snacking is a new thing since the 1970s.  Companies that make snack foods want to sell things to you and are uninterested in your health or well being.

[https://www.dietdoctor.com/when\-we\-eat\-is\-as\-important\-as\-what\-we\-eat\-and\-this\-is\-why](https://www.dietdoctor.com/when-we-eat-is-as-important-as-what-we-eat-and-this-is-why)

I think he makes a number of interesting points about meal timing and its impact on nutrition.  One study he talks about had prediabetic men change when they ate.  The study was isocaloric, randomized and crossover design.  ""The benefits were huge. Mean insulin levels dropped significantly, and insulin resistance dropped as well. Insulin is a driver of obesity, so merely changing the meal timing and restricting the number of hours you ate, and also by moving to an earlier eating schedule produced huge benefits even in the same person eating the same meals. That’s astounding. Even more remarkable was that even after the washout period of 7 weeks, the eTRF group *maintained* lower insulin levels at baseline.

Flossing alone takes me like 15 minutes each time! \(plackers don't work for me, waterpik I can't bring to work\).

"What exactly is a ""pound of fat""?","I've heard that a pound of fat is equal to 3,500 calories. However, what exactly is the fat composed of? Is it composed entirely of fat? Or is it made up of a combination of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins? 

I know that when we eat, we are taking in 3 major things: fat, carbohydrates, and proteins. I don't know though whether our belly fat is solely just fat. Do the proteins that we eat transport to the muscles and the carbohydrates to be used in respiration, leaving the fat in our bellies to be 100% pure fats? Is that how it works? Or is there fats, carbohydrates, and proteins distributed everywhere in our body? 

Apparently, 1 pound is equal to 453.592 grams. And we know that 1 gram of fat is equal to 9 calories. So doesn't that mean one pound of fat should equal 4,082 calories, not 3,500? Unless when they refer to a pound of ""fat"", they aren't specifically talking about ""fats"" but as a generic term for all the food we take in, including carbohydrates and proteins.

Food listings of serving size by weight with nutrient info?,"I've been looking and I couldn't find anything that seems to be a list of different foods and how much a serving portion should weigh. I prefer the idea of weighing my food in most cases since that seems to be a much more practical way to have a certain level of consistency.

The closest thing I've found is this webpage from an [Austrailian gov health site](https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/food-essentials/how-much-do-we-need-each-day/serve-sizes) that seems to give helpful approximations but I'm hoping to find something more detailed.

For example, that linked page says that a serving of vegetables is \~75g, but the energy range is 100\-350kJ \(\~23\-83cal\). This makes sense for the most part but it's not really helpful in terms of determining what or how much of a vegetable I should eat. Basically it could take 2 portions of ""vegetable A"" to equal the caloric value of 1 portion of ""vegetable B"". I'm wanting to be able to identify based on what are the nutrients of a given food build a balanced diet.

Is there such a table that I can reference to build a complete nutritional diet that offers variety? \(i.e. I like eating spinach but how much romaine lettuce is equivalent?

This has honestly has thrown me for a loop, because I regularly work out 2-4 times a week and I had always believed though my diet isn't amazing it is considerably better than many of peers and family. The only conclusion I can gather from this is that, obviously, my diet needs to be strictly monitored and maybe my lack of/nonexistent implementation of cardio was the cause of this cholesterol spike.

I have now started doing cardio after my workouts, but on the diet front I'm in a bind. I'm not really sure how many grams of carbs would qualify as low carb diet.

I'm aware there are recent \(and not so recent\) studies which conclude that saturated fats are not dangerous to human health and that people who follow Keto or Paleo\-style diets will usually quote one of these studies.

Myself, I'm still 50/50 on the debate. Every single time I've considered a Keto diet or planned meals, I usually either give up very quickly or at the point of buying food due to feeling apprehensive about the amount of saturated fat I would be consuming.

Study - Supplemental Vitamins and Minerals for CVD Prevention and Treatment,"Might be interesting for some RD or other interested people

Abstract:

The authors identified individual randomized controlled trials from previous meta\-analyses and additional searches, and then performed meta\-analyses on cardiovascular disease outcomes and all\-cause mortality. The authors assessed publications from 2012, both before and including the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force review. Their systematic reviews and meta\-analyses showed generally moderate\- or low\-quality evidence for preventive benefits \(folic acid for total cardiovascular disease, folic acid and B\-vitamins for stroke\), no effect \(multivitamins, vitamins C, D, β\-carotene, calcium, and selenium\), or increased risk \(antioxidant mixtures and niacin \[with a statin\] for all\-cause mortality\). Conclusive evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds \(including deficiency and sufficiency\) was not demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks.

The role of oxidized dietary cholesterol,"So I've just watched these two videos:

[Oxidized Cholesterol as a Cause of Alzheimer’s Disease](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/oxidized-cholesterol-as-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease/)

[How to Reduce Cholesterol Oxidation](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-reduce-cholesterol-oxidation/)

It's [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org) so some people will probably ignore this post already and others will scream cherry picking. But I think it's an interesting topic and wanted to discuss it a bit.

I found [this study](http://www.jlr.org/content/46/5/1047.long) referenced the most interesting, because I had been under the impression that cholesterol doesn't cross the BB\-Barrier, however oxidized cholesterol such as 27\-hydrocholesterol does. 

Also of interest is obviously that [oxidized dietary cholesterol contributes to lipoprotein oxidation](http://www.jlr.org/content/44/4/705.long).

Does lactose intolerance have any connections to a flatter belly?,"I just discovered last night that I have lactose intolerance. Unfortunately, I had to find out the hard way because I took in a lot of dairy before getting an LI attack. I had stomach bloating, crazy stomach cramps and sharp pains all night long. I didn't vomit, although there were several instances in which I felt like I was going to vomit.

Now, I don't want people to misunderstand what I meant in my question in the title. I am NEVER going to go through that pain again. This is a once\-in\-a\-lifetime thing, and I'm not encouraging people who are LI to force themselves to kill themselves to weight loss.

But, after a grueling and traumatic night of what I believe to be gas being trapped in my colon \(I say that because the pain temporarily subsided whenever I happened to pass gas\), I woke up with a flatter stomach. Of course, it's going to look flatter, when the effects subside because of stomach bloating and all, but it looks a bit flatter than before the stomach bloating. I'm just wondering if there's some kind of connection between having gas stuck in one's colon and looking fatter because of it. Thank you.",nutrition,1527871975,hiroshi_jun,0,1,True,2018-06-01

Help! Depressed lonely brother is wanting to self inject B12 DAILY!,"\(crosspost from r/vegan\)

Nutshell. Older brother is 95&amp;#37; vegan for several years. No dairy or meats. He's also depressed, isolated, 32 year old pizza delivery driver, \(for past 10 years\)

In February, he started having B12 deficiency symptoms, muscle twitches, dizziness, etc.

Goes through a handful of doctors to one who diagnoses him as B12 deficient. Bloodwork showed him at 157 pg/mL. Normal range is 190\-900.

Doctor prescribes one shot of B12 weekly, for 4 weeks.

My brother also starts using liquid supplements, purchased from Amazon.

He got his bloodwork results back last week. His new B12 score is around 1400!

But he thinks there is a delay to it actually working, and that the blood level doesn't indicate how he should be feeling, or how he thinks he should feel.

Now he ordered [these injectables](https://vitaminquick.com/collections/injectable-b12)

They are not GMP certified, and are manufactured in China, to the best of what I can gather.

I told him I hoped that if he did indeed decide to start self\-injecting, he would keep it on the weekly frequency, same as the doctor originally prescribed his first 4 shots. I also said I hoped he wasn't trying to do it daily, for god's sakes. Problem is, he was very noncommittal when I cautioned against a daily B12 injection. He also mentioned that a couple air bubbles or so were fine when injecting intramuscularly \(thigh, buttock\) WTF?

What do I do?

People who eat spicy foods live longer. Those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% reduction in total mortality.,"https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3942

Abstract
Objective To examine the associations between the regular consumption of spicy foods and total and cause specific mortality.

Design Population based prospective cohort study.

Setting China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008.

Participants 199 293 men and 288 082 women aged 30 to 79 years at baseline after excluding participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke at baseline.

Main exposure measures Consumption frequency of spicy foods, self reported once at baseline.

Main outcome measures Total and cause specific mortality.

Results During 3 500 004 person years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median 7.2 years), a total of 11 820 men and 8404 women died. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Spicy food consumption showed highly consistent inverse associations with total mortality among both men and women after adjustment for other known or potential risk factors. In the whole cohort, compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96), 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92), and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality. The inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was stronger in those who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases.

Conclusion In this large prospective study, the habitual consumption of spicy foods was inversely associated with total and certain cause specific mortality, independent of other risk factors of death.",nutrition,1527962884,Bluest_waters,39,318,True,2018-06-02

Seven spices were found to contain numerous antioxidant phytochemicals and have an overall, but variable, prebiotic effect on 88 known species of microbiome bacteria.

The researchers tested seven spices (black pepper, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, ginger, Mediterranean oregano, rosemary, and turmeric) and documented their chemical composition, antioxidant effect, and possible prebiotic effects. The authors defined prebiotics as “…substances that induce the growth or activity of microorganisms that contribute to the well-being of their host.”

They found that all plants, except turmeric, promoted the growth of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus species (“good” bacteria), whereas all seven plant extracts inhibited the growth of Ruminococcus species (a “bad” bacteria).

What is a safe calorie deficit?,"Hi Reddit,

First time poster in this sub. 26 y/o male, 5’9””, ~187lbs.

As part of getting in shape this summer I’ve started tracking my calories using the FatSecret app and eating what I consider very healthy. Using different calculators, considering my “moderately active” lifestyle, I’m supposed to be getting 2800 calories per day.

The problem is that I’ve been eating an average of 2000 calories over the past 2 weeks. Now I’m pretty sure I’ve been getting enough protein from milk+whey protein after workouts, ground turkey used in various meals, grilled chicken breasts, peanut butter, etc. I’m also sure I’m getting enough fats from nuts, almonds, olive oil, etc.

What I’ve noticed is that the carbs I’ve cut out of my diet is the cause of the low calorie intake. I’ve used multigrain pasta and brown rice&amp;quinoa for dinners, but eating breads, e.g., multigrain bread sparingly. A chunk of my carbs have been coming from raw veggies. But whole cucumbers and carrots can only add so many calories.

This has resulted in a calorie deficit of ~800. Now is my 2800 calorie estimate too high to begin with? I’m not necessarily going to bed hungry (I wrestled in high school and have a pretty good feel of the effects of under-eating). Is an 800 calorie deficit to high? Should I have healthier snacks/power bars on hand to get me to 2300+ calories? I’m trying to lean up a bit so I’m aiming to drop to &lt;180lbs.

Thanks in advance for any feedback!

Well they baited me...

The whole article talks about protein, protein, protein, and the negative effects of a high protein diet. I was expecting to read about how my protein shakes are causing disease by elevating my overall protein consumption.

The closest we get to a specific linker between protein as a compound and disease is:

&gt; [Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, says] I suspect one of the reasons why high protein intake may be linked to heart failure could be related to the kidneys not coping as well.

What the article is actually attacking is red meat consumption (under the guise of ""high protein diets"") as we learn towards the end:

&gt; But not all protein has been associated with these negative consequences. Protein sourced from poultry, dairy and plants such as beans, peas and nuts, is thought to have a neutral or even beneficial impact on kidney and heart health, provided it is consumed in moderation.

Is this lazy, irresponsible journalism, or am I being too harsh? The idea of high protein consumption causing stress on the kidneys is interesting, but isn't backed up by any evidence here.",nutrition,1528112649,NDreader,9,33,True,2018-06-04

"Soy makes me feel terrible, why?","Makes me feel anxious, depressed, nauseous, I get sensitive nipples and in large amounts (lots of soy sauce on my stir fry...droool) I can sometimes experience testicular pain . It took me a long time to pinpoint that soy was the problem, I actually blamed gluten, garlic and fish before realising.

I've experienced this with soy sauce, oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce, soy milk, soy in bread and tofu.

I went to some doctors years ago, I think it was 2011 and they couldn't work it out, no allergy and my test levels came back as normal. Same in 2013 and my test levels were actually better last year, but they obviously do fluctuate.

I know of a few people who have experienced he same or similar effects, although one of them is a female who obviously had different side effects. 

I don't want to harp on too much but I went to a uni seminar hosted by a couple of blokes who worked with elite athletes and they told someone in the audience that they don't recommend soy to their clients. I explained my symptoms (I said I was asking for a mate cos I was embarrassed) and they said to a lesser extent the symptoms are actually fairly common but go unnoticed, hence why I (the someone who isn't me) took so long to work out what was causing it. They explained why but my minuscule brain couldn't understand it at that point as I was a 1st year. So all I really took away from it was to just leave the soy alone. Since then I haven't experienced those symptoms, I even had mild gyno which slowly disappeared, was a relief because I was considering surgery which isn't cheap.

Since then I've seen very little that seems to state that soy is unhealthy at all, some studies even seeming to indicate that it's healthy. Which surprised me and has led me to believe that I and the few others I know with these side effects are perhaps experiencing them for different reasons.

Without having to go to the hassle of having more needles stabbed into me, can anybody explain what may be causing this in myself and a few others? Whereas most don't seem to notice or get any negative effects at all? 

I've adjusted to life without soy as I discovered soy sauce flavoured sauce that has no soy in it, but I'm a bit curious, perhaps this is a sign of some hidden illness in some people and soy just triggers it?

All help hugely appreciated! 

Edit: just thought I'd clarify this isn't an anti soy anti vegan thing or whatever. A mate of mine is a vegan and when I explained my experience (he asked why I don't eat soy) he got a bit offended and thought I was out to get him.

Split green peas: nutritional value,"Hi everyone,


The strangest thing appeared to me. When I look at the nutrional value of split green peas, the internet says (on many different websites): around 24 gr.

Now, since split green peas come from green peas, you'd expect green peas to have at least the same amount of protein. But appearently they don't...: around 7 gr.

Study: Is vegetarianism healthy for children?,"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2018.1437024

ABSTRACT

According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' influential position statement on vegetarianism, meat and seafood can be replaced with milk, soy/legumes, and eggs without any negative effects in children. The United States Department of Agriculture endorses a similar view. The present paper argues that the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics ignores or gives short shrift to direct and indirect evidence that vegetarianism may be associated with serious risks for brain and body development in fetuses and children. Regular supplementation with iron, zinc, and B12 will not mitigate all of these risks. Consequently, we cannot say decisively that vegetarianism or veganism is safe for children.",nutrition,1523941683,1345834,37,7,True,2018-04-17

Gut bacteria effects on the absorption of supplements?,"Hello

I have one question regarding absorption of various supplements such as fish oil or multivitamins.

I have a feeling my gut bacteria are out of whack due to my poor diet choices for multiple years. Recently I started taking probiotics for that purpose.

However, I would like to know if lack of ""good"" gut-bacteria and the majority of ""bad"" gut-bacteria impact absorption of supplements (not talking about food).

Nuts(for the oatmeal): Seems like almonds are the ""best"", but mixing with several others doesn't seem that much ""worse"", stick with only almonds or mix?

Seeds(oatmeal): Chia seeds seems the most popular for health, but many like to add sunflower and pumpkin seeds too as nr 2 and 3, choose chia, mix those 3 or mix more?

Berries(with cottage cheese/greek yoghurt): BLUEBERRIES, hah, stand out heavily it seems, or darker berries in general like blackberries, stick with blueberries or mix? Mix with what in that case, there are so many, maybe doesn't matter?

Beans(in the minsed meat mix):Here it seems like the same case with berries, the darker the better, that means brown and black, but no harm done if adding kidney, white or greens, stick with black or mix?

Greens: Spinach, kale, broccoli, avokado and green peas stand out, stick with that or add?

Others: Will include carrots, orangejuice, cranberryjuice, garlic, onions, banana, mushrooms, bell pepper, tomatoes, corn and chickpeas, all of these are okay right? Heard some not being in favor of having corn at all, but I like the taste, can't be that bad right?

Dietary factors are the single most significant risk factor for disability and premature death in the United States. Are medical professionals trained to give nutritional advice to their patients?,"The AMA is partnering with the suburban Chicago-based Gaples Institute for Integrative Cardiology—a nonprofit focused on enhancing the role nutrition and lifestyle changes play in health care—to provide physicians with a new, three-hour online nutrition course for clinicians.

Evidence for magnesium chelates as an effective supplementary form of magnesium.,"Hi all, 

Labdoor's first three recommendations for magnesium supplements are all chelated forms of magnesium. 

I looked a little closer into this issue and could not find any clinical studies regarding the efficacy of magnesium chelates (I paid the most attention to magnesium bisglycinate but looked into a few other Mg chelates as well). 

I eventually did find ONE write-up specifically regarding the efficacy of magnesium bisglycinate, found here: https://www.omundernaehrung.com/media/documents/en/Siebrecht_Dr_Stefan_Magnesium_bisglycinate.pdf . However, this is not a clinical study. Moreover, I perceived the sourcing in this article as rather scanty, which makes me suspicious of its accuracy.

I am wondering what the nutrition community's consensus is on this issue, and if there is something I am missing--with a BS in human bio, I can understand what these papers are saying, but I don't really know that I have the experience to evaluate their validity. 

Thanks in advance! ",nutrition,1524205621,__juniper,1,10,True,2018-04-20

Question about multivitamins - noticing a difference compared to what I'm used to,"So years ago, in my early 20s, I lost about 110 lbs in the space of 10 months.  
I didn't really follow a specific diet - just made better choices, and cut out soda, candy and fast food.  
Started exercising, took a good multivitamin, etc.  
Always noticed the same thing everyone else does - when you take a multivitamin, it turns your pee into rocket fuel.  
At a certain point after losing the weight, I started having massive health problems - frequent (5-7  days/week) migraines, whole body joint pain and fatigue, excessive popping/cracking of my joints, etc.  
This caused lots of depression because it was too painful to exercise, and I was told to stop until we figured out the cause.  
This was 7 years ago now, and still no answers.  
Anyway, I've now gained most (luckily not all) of that weight back due to these 7 years of being lazy.  
I've started eating better now and I'm trying to get back on track.  
Haven't started exercising yet because Wisconsin winter sucks, but I'll get there.  
I started up on another multivitamin - the same one I used to take.  
I noticed now that my pee doesn't turn bright colors like it used to.  
Not much has changed really compared to the last time I lost weight.  
Is it possible that I have some really bad vitamin deficiencies?  
Haven't been able to set up a meet with my doc yet to run some tests, but I'm just curious if this has happened to anyone else and what it might be.",nutrition,1524313741,GreekNord,5,2,True,2018-04-21

What happens if you completely cut fruits/vegetables out of your diet?,"I've always been curious as to what would be the effects on your body if you cut one or both of these things out of your diet, without adjusting the rest of your diet to make up for the loss of nutrients or taking supplements (although I know that their efficacy is questionable).

Some of these people are in fact quite fit. Hence I'm wondering what would be the medium and long term consequences of such a diet. 

edit: sorry for the title, I was not referring to a hard and absolute cut (eg. avoiding all vegetables even potatoes &lt;are they technically vegetables?), but more of consumption that is extremely far below the recommended intake.

edit2: just a clarification, the people I know aren't deliberately following such a diet TO BE HEALTHY (at least minus those who are following a strict no carb high fat diet), but do so out of preference.

"adults who take a novel antioxidant that specifically targets cellular powerhouses, or mitochondria, see aging of their blood vessels reverse by the equivalent of 15 to 20 years within six weeks, according to new research.","https://www.colorado.edu/today/2018/04/19/novel-antioxidant-makes-old-blood-vessels-seem-young-again

Older adults who take a novel antioxidant that specifically targets cellular powerhouses, or mitochondria, see aging of their blood vessels reverse by the equivalent of 15 to 20 years within six weeks, according to new CU Boulder research.

The study suggests targeting mitochondria with antioxidants may be an effective way of combatting cardiovascular aging.
For the study, Rossman and senior author Doug Seals, director of the Integrative Physiology of Aging Laboratory, recruited 20 healthy men and women age 60 to 79 from the Boulder area.

Half took 20 milligrams per day of a commercially available supplement called MitoQ. It's made by chemically altering the naturally-occurring antioxidant Coenzyme Q10 to make it cling to mitochondria inside cells. 

The other half took a placebo.

After six weeks, researchers assessed how well the lining of blood vessels, or the endothelium, functioned, by measuring how much subjects’ arteries dilated with increased blood flow.

Then, after a two-week “wash out” period of taking nothing, the two groups switched, with the placebo group taking the supplement, and vice versa. The tests were repeated.

The researchers found that when taking the supplement, dilation of subjects’ arteries improved by 42 percent, making their blood vessels, at least by that measure, look like those of someone 15 to 20 years younger. An improvement of that magnitude, if sustained, is associated with about a 13 percent reduction in heart disease, Rossman said. The study also showed that the improvement in dilation was due to a reduction in oxidative stress.

In participants who, under placebo conditions, had stiffer arteries—another indication of vascular dysfunction—supplementation was associated with reduced stiffness.

I have a hard time eating foods because of my OCD. For example I like how steak and chicken tastes but I don't like the way it looks and feels. I just can't force myself to eat it all the time. I don't plan live off of meal replacements even if I find a great one but I just don't get enough protein and fiber and I probably don't get enough micronutrients.

"16% body fat, ""skinny fat"" trying to build muscle while also losing stubborn belly fat, is my nutrition/diet good enough with my routine?","I've been hitting the gym following the Kinobody thing my friend bootlegged for me for a little under a month now, I've been seeing and feeling some results. Wondering if my current/proposed physical activity, combined with my current diet (suggestions of additions/removals greatly welcomed!) will allow me to shrink my belly/make it look smaller.

However, I still have a bit of a belly. I'm 6'1, 155 lbs on average (it goes up one or two pounds depending on the day, and then goes back to around 155), waist is 33 inches, hip is 34, neck is 14.5 inches. I've got a bit of a belly as stated before, but everyone tells me that once I get higher and higher lifts and the muscle mass that comes with it, my overall bf% will go down/not look as significant. Right now I eat somewhere between 2500-2700 calories a day, though it is not uncommon for me to go even below 2500.

I've also started to implement HIIT after weight training on three days, where I'll be doing mostly sprints (Might alternate with rowing, but I feel sprinting would be more intense), and I've been implementing a leangains diet on weekends (parents won't let me skip breakfast on school days, I am currently a senior in HS), though I'm not entirely sure if this is necessary for my goal of shrinking my belly/making it look smaller. I know a few guys who probably have a similar body fat % to me but because they have significant muscle you don't notice it as much.

Anyway, here's what I usually eat on a given school day (Monday to Thursday)

Breakfast:
Bowl of cheerios with milk
Homemade chocolate milk (idk why but my mom likes making it for me so I let her do it)
Chobani Greek Yogurt (some days I'll skip it)

Lunch:
Deli sandwich made by family's supermarket (Buffalo chicken, chipotle gouda cheese, tomato, mayo, etc.)

Dinner:
Depends, every now and again it's tacos, but most of the time it's some sort of lean meat (steak, chicken, etc.) with carbs (potatoes, rice) and other veggies (steamed broc****)

Snacks:
Usually I have a nutrigrain bar or some protein bar during school. At worst I'll have a poptart or a bag of mini cookies (shared with friends, 10 small cookies or less, barely 100 calories for all those pieces)

On Fridays, I don't breakfast, but I get a pork roll egg and cheese on a bagel for lunch. Dinner varies. Saturday and Sunday same thing, except lunch also varies, and Sunday dinner is very similar to the school day dinner.

I was always taught as a kid that to have a balanced diet you had to eat both fruit **and** vegetables. But are there actually nutrients that are found exclusively in fruit and not vegetables?

There are also all kinds of foods that are considered fruit in a biological sense, but that are ""ordinarily"" considered vegetables (e.g. tomatoes, zucchinis, capsicums). If someone eats a wide variety of vegetables and fruits that operate like vegetables, but doesn't eat any sweet, acidic fruits (e.g. berries, citrus fruits, etc.), are they maintaining a balanced diet?

For context: I'm vegetarian, and I eat a huge amount of home-cooked meals full of veggies. But I've always absolutely hated fruit (I mean fruit in the layman's sense). I don't think I've eaten any fruit in several months, except for ones like tomatoes and zucchinis.

"I think I am zinc deficient, and it's making me hate my body for thr first time ever","Didn't know if subjects this touchy were allowed here. If not, may someone point me to the correct subreddit? Thanks.




I am currently 17 years old, male, and 6'3.  I recently noticed that what I thought was a growth of fat around my nipple area would not go away. It's been a year since the growth has appeared. After further research, I found that it is not fat, but tissue growth around my nippes and is called gynecomastia. Upon even further research, I've found that gyecomastia is caused by a hormonal imbalance, most notably testosterone and estrogen. 





This set some alarm bells off. I barely grow any facial hair, and my testes are abnormally small (around the size of the M and Ms), two signs of low testosterone. I did research on how testosterone is naturally produced, and I saw that Vitamin D and zinc are the two main components in the production of testosterone. I looked up what foods contain a lot of zinc and my heart dropped. Nuts, spinach, seafood, white mushrooms, beef. I barely eat any of those. The closest thing to Vitamin D I get is in the little cartons of milk my school provides (I eat school lunch) and I really don't think that it has much Vitamin D. I read that zinc is instrumental during a male's puberty years, and a lack of it could cause delayed sexual maturation, and my tiny balls seem to really indicate that I'm zinc deficient.







I don't know how to feel about this. I used to look at posts in other subreddits of people having insecurities about their bodies and would be thankful that I didn't have those problems. Now I have that feeling towards the growth around my nipples and my abnormally small testes. It's really not a good feeling AT ALL. I started really working out using my body weight a week ago (which I saw encouraged testosterone growth but didn't known at the time). Knowing that I can't work off thr tissue growth around my breasts has me bummed. It hurts me even more since I'm fancying a lady. This shit would probably destroy my confidence talking to her or any other attractive girls, and I've just seen a rise in my confidence after working on it for months. I want to try and incorporate more zinc into my diet, but my mom is a nurse and asking her to buy more foods containing zinc would definitely set her off and she's the last person I want to have this conversation with, and suggesting supplements would put her over thr top. But I'm willing to risk it if it means the tissue buoldup in my nippes can go away and my testes can grow into normal size. Am I overreacting?",nutrition,1524793362,CoolHatEffect,10,0,True,2018-04-26

Healthy Vegetarian Diet,"Hi All, 

(On mobile, so no flair) 

This is my first post in r/nutrition and from reading precvious posts, I think you all give great advice. I am transitioning to a vegetarian diet and would like to gain most of my nutrients from real food (i.e. fruits, vegetables, whole grains, eggs, etc.) My issue is that coming from a Hispanic background, I don't even know where to begin with fresh vegetables! To put it plainly, I ate meat EVERYDAY as a child with little to no vegetables, but an abundance of rice and other high carb food in large portions (i.e tortillas, tamales made  with masa, etc). After learning about the treatment of animals, environmental issues around animals, and realizing I actually like meatless meals (I have red lentil dahl and almost died of joy!!), I know I want to be a vegetarian. I do enjoy some vegetables and they include: mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and kale. I also have tried farro for the first time and it was amazing!!! Although I love these things, they are not the only things I want to eat for my vegetarian diet. I've tried centering my diet around these things and only reverted to eating junk food. 


While I do not live with my family anymore, the cooking practices of my family are still with me and cause difficulties in regards to learning how to cook with more vegetables and having meatless meals. My question is, how can I build a vegetarian lifestyle that does not center around junkie processed food or imitaion meats? I want to be the healthiest and feel safisfies with my meatless options. Thanks in advance! ",nutrition,1524837107,ChocolateNaps,22,16,True,2018-04-27
Are fats supposed to be limited on a whole food plant-based diet?,"I see a lot of people referring to a whole food plant-based diet, and whom often give examples of the foods they eat e.g. legumes, leafy greens, whole grains, fruit and veg etc.


However, they never seem to mention higher fat foods from plants like avocado and nuts.

Is WFPB really just a high carb, low fat diet?

I *know* moderation is key, and I *know* that higher fat plant foods are calorie dense, but if I was sticking to a calorie deficit (say consuming 1300kcals per day), would eat an avocado a day, or 50g of nuts in addition to the usual plant based foods be an issue?

What kind of macros do those who follow a WFPB diet follow/try and stick to? 

I know that way of eating is typically high carb, but nowhere seems to specificy how much fat/protein is ideal when eating this way.

Is there any truth in Sequential Eating?,"Any quick   digesting foods must wait till the slowest digesting foods leave the   stomach before they can leave \- a process which can take up to 6 or 8   hours. While waiting, the fruit, cooked and raw vegetables, and some of   the starches undergo some decomposition and fermentation, producing  gas,  acid and even alcohol along with indigestion. .....

Even  if you are not eating a perfect diet sequential eating can have a huge  impact on your digestion. In a nutshell this is basically eating the  most liquid and easiest to digest foods first, and then eating the foods  that digest slower afterwards. For example, say you had a meal that  consisted of fruits, vegetables, starches, and meat. This would be the  exact order you would want to eat them.

1. Eat the most liquid food first, which would normally be the fruit.
2. Next eat the vegetables.
3. Then the starches.
4. And last the meat.

If  you don’t follow this sequential eating here’s what happens. Heavy  proteins and fats take the longest to digest. If you eat starches or  fruits after meat then they will sit on top of the meat in the stomach  and begin to ferment before your body has the time to digest them. This  will cause gas and alcohol to build inside of you.",nutrition,1524843078,ScarlettPup,8,0,True,2018-04-27

Need some motivation,"Hello! Sorry to bother everybody, but I have been thinking about doing this for quite a long time and I feel like I need it more than usual, so. 
I'm 1.70m and weigh around 56.5kg. This is not bad per say, the problem lies in the fact that I lost more than 11 kg in the last few months as a result of a depressive period which I'm not sure I'm completely through, even though I managed to make some serious progress in the past month or so, mostly thanks to my family. 

The thing is that after everything I do not dislike the way I look, I like it better than I used to, in facts. Because of this I'm stuck with an often less-than-1500 kcal per day diet with almost no fats (except for dinner, when I'm not the one cooking) and with a kind of food anxiety which leads me to feel uncomfortable after eating 50gr of brown bread, some 20gr (or possibly less than that) of cured raw ham without visible fat and a tomato for lunch. 

I'm constantly thinking about food and about how to avoid eating too much, which makes me feel bad for eating too little or even the right amount. I'm stuck between websites where people are told to diet in ways which I can't possibly achieve because of my super busy routine which doesn't let me go for more than 10-20 minutes of bodyweight exercises daily before breakfast, which makes matters even worse.

Sorry for the wall of text, but stuff is starting to get unbearable, my muscles are aching and my legs feel dizzy all the time. I need someone to tell me that I'm doing stuff the wrong way. ",nutrition,1524859226,Hurr_Guy,2,2,True,2018-04-27

I have a theory that when you hardly eat your body will 100% absorb anything you do eat. So say that you haven't eaten all day and then you decide to eat a bowl of vegetables and salad - all those minerals/vitamins will be fully absorbed into your body.
Whereas if you've been eating all day your body is still digesting food so you wouldn't absorb so many vitamins from eating vegetables.

Vitamin D Screening and Supplementation in Primary Care: Time to Curb Our Enthusiasm,"KENNETH W. LIN, MD, MPH, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, District of Columbia

Am Fam Physician. 2018 Feb 15;97(4):226-227.
 
&gt;Recent trends in vitamin D testing and supplementation strongly suggest that physicians and patients believe that identifying and correcting vitamin D deficiency improves health outcomes. From 2000 to 2010, the volume of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) tests reimbursed by Medicare Part B increased 83-fold.1 In 2000, four out of 1,000 U.S. adults 70 years or older reported taking a daily vitamin D supplement of at least 1,000 IU, compared with four out of 10 in 2014—a 100-fold increase.2

&gt;In contrast, LeFevre and LeFevre's review of the evidence for vitamin D screening and supplementation in adults in this issue of American Family Physician determined that these commonplace practices have virtually no established health benefits.3 The American Society for Clinical Pathology recommends against screening for vitamin D deficiency in the general population.4 The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence that vitamin D supplementation prevents cardiovascular disease, cancer, or fractures in community-dwelling adults.5–7 An umbrella review of more than 100 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials found only a handful of “probable” relationships between serum vitamin D concentrations and clinical outcomes, and concluded that vitamin D supplementation does not increase bone mineral density or reduce the risk of fractures or falls in older adults.8",nutrition,1524936616,plantpistol,1,2,True,2018-04-28

I thought it could be a hiatial hernia,  because of my recent experience with IBS symptoms and the  occasional acid reflux. Anyway.. .

I'm worried. I've gained some weight this past year, I'd say about 25 pounds and frankly, I've been eating very badly. Sweets. Candies, burgers, you name it and not much exercise.

Ever wondered about the healthiness of food combining?,"Most of the food we eat is a combination of several ingredients. Unless we pick up a fruit or a veg and eat it plain &amp; raw, which isn't the world's main food staple, we're probably eating something this is a mixture of stuff.

Now what's wrong with that? Well if you think about it, nature never intended for us to eat different things together, but one thing at a time. Only humans eat several ingredients together. You won't see a monkey collecting a banana and a strawberry and wait up so it can eat them up together as a shake.

Each food requires different chemistry to be digested properly. It's well-known that you shouldn't mix up certain foods as they don't combine well together, i.e milk &amp; banana is considered a very bad combination according to Ayurveda.

That's just one aspect. Another one is related to the consumption of the basic ingredient without additions. Let's take a cultural example: Where I live, it's common to ""wipe"" hummus with a pitta bread. All my life I ate this way, up until recently when I decided to drop the pitta and eat with a fork. I noticed, on several occasions, that I can eat more of both the pitta and the hummus when I combine between them, despite being fulfilled of both when eaten alone. I don't want the pitta, I don't want the hummus, but when combined, suddenly I can eat more and even much more. The reason I believe is that it's like I created a completely new kind of food. It's a hummus with a texture of a pitta bread, and a pitta with a flavor of a hummus. It's a different beast, but essentially, my body gets the exact same ingredients I didn't want to eat any longer: the pitta, and the hummus. I'm done with them, but I can still eat more when combined. Think about pizza. I used to eat a whole tray by myself. Would I do it if it weren't for the cheese &amp; sauce? Hell, it's like eating about 14 slices of bread! Who does that, though? Who eats a loaf of bread in one setting?

The outcome: feeling too full, bloated, heavy, sleepy, gassy, what have you. And that's just one layer of combinations, as in the hummus example the pitta bread is already a combination of ingredients (wheat and salt/sugar/yeast), and also a hummus which is a combination of chickpeas &amp; tahini with spices. Would I eat just chickpeas alone? And tahini? what if there weren't any spices? From experience I can tell you it ALL make a *Hugh* difference. All it takes is just one ingredient to make you eat more of the other one, even if you wouldn't eat anything *at all*. Such case of not eating at all could be a cake without sugar. Or cereal without milk. Or pasta without sauce. Or veggies without the sandwich. Or hamburger without the bun &amp; ketchup. The list goes on and go. We combine most of our food, hence we eat way too much, not just in quantity but in quality: we eat stuff we may not eat if they weren't combined, and we eat more of it because it is combined. The outcome? Obesity. Diabetes. Gastrointestinal problems. Skin problems. Cancer.

Think about it the next time you eat. I'm personally a vegan and mostly a fruitarian for the past 6 months. When it's up to me I don't combine my food at all, I eat anything by itself. The results are amazing. Everything works perfectly. It's when I eat the occasional cooked mixed meal in a social setting that I feel the detrimental effect of food being unnaturally altered &amp; combined.",nutrition,1525003885,relZi9er,4,0,True,2018-04-29

What is Vitamin and its role,"Hello Every one !
Lots people are very curious to know of Vitamin . What exactly it is ?
Vitamin is something which our body cannot make but needed for life through diet or Supplement. 

There are 13 essential Vitamin which play lots of vital work in our body and deficiency of any vitamin can cause major heath problem .

Vitamins are in fact micro nutrients that are very essential to life.It is needed in lower quantity as compare to others three nutrients Carbohydrates,Protein and Fats . Vitamins are Organic Substance(compound),It means it found both in animals and Plants.

Vitamin function as a Co-enzyme.We know ENZYMES are Catalyst in the chemical reaction that takes place continuously in our body.Vitamins are fundamental part of our body.

if we are able to walk,blink,breathe etc because of Enzyme.

Without Enzyme your body can't break down Protein into essential amino acids,Electron Cant flow and nerve transmission can't flow.

 And without Vitamin Enzymes cant do their job.

Vitamins Works as antioxidants and hormone , certain other essential work is  done by Vitamin So it is said Vitamins are Essential to life.
After they have been absorbed Vitamins become part of the structure of the body-of the cell,enzymes,muscles,blood and bones .As a part of the body pool these substance remains in the body for varying amount of time.
Some Vitamins are utilized immediately and some are stored and utilized over a period of time. 
1-Water Soluble Vitamin. These Vitamins are not stored in your body because don't stay more than 2-4 days in your body  .Any extra is extracted through Urine. 
Vitamin C &amp;  B-Group Vitamins  are water soluble vitamin .Utilization of these vitamins begin just after they are absorbed through your digestion System.These vitamins must be replenished  regularly since they are not stored.
2-Fat Soluble Vitamin. A,D,E,and K belong to this group,although these are stored normally in Fat tissue,Some may also be stored in organ especially in liver,therefore you can have toxicity problem with some of Fat soluble vitamin. But When you take very large doses .",nutrition,1525079873,polojafri,0,0,True,2018-04-30

Would eating sugary foods together with a fiber supplement make it less unhealthy?,"So I've heard this numerous times: sugar in fruit is okay for our bodies because it is digested slowly thanks to the high fiber content, however white sugar and sugar laden foods don't have fiber and you get a sudden sugar kick and blood sugar spikes, liver overload etc. (Sorry for rookie language).



So this made me wonder, what if I ate a bowl of ice cream with bran flakes, or just had some candy with these fiber balls that are meant to supplement fiber on the side? Would that make it easier for my body to tolerate the sugar? If not, then what's the difference between and apple and, say, a glass of apple juice with fiber supplements?

So what exactly is a complex carb? Where is the line drawn?,"From what I understand there are 3 forms of carbohydrates. Sugars,starches,and indigestible fiber. Sugars are the smallest and easiest to digest. They raise the blood sugar the most and are considered to be the most detrimental in health. But only in surplus otherwise are great for replenishing depleted glycogen.

Then there are starches. Amylose and amylopectin. These are the complex carbohydrates otherwise known as starches. Depending on how they are bundled ot encapsulated they be considered ""resistant""starches. Like cold potato starch. 

So either a digestible carb is a starch or a sugar. 

I was reading an article where the author was praising the benefit of ""complex"" carbs but warning of the dangers of ""refined carbs"" which he called simple and said are things like breads and pasta. What? Wouldn't these also be considered complex? Some go as far as to say bread and pasta are the equivilants of sugar? 

This does not make sense to me as they are still mainly composed of amylose and amylopectin and I fail to see how they are any different than the amylose and amylopectin found in rice,potato, oatmeal,etc. Save for a tiny bit of fiber. But still starch is starch. Does refining a starch somehow make it simple?

Is sugar a logical reason to switch from dairy milk to almond milk?,"Hi, sorry I've posted a couple of questions here recently, I've just been a bit overwhelmed with my diet, particularly sugar, and everyone in this subreddit is extremely helpful so thanks for that. 

I used to drink a lot of dairy semi-skimmed milk, about 700ml everyday as I'd have a bowl of plain unsweetened cereal twice a day. I use MyFitnessPal and I simply never tracked my milk consumption, I guess because I didn't want to see it. However I recently gave in and started to track the milk I was consuming, and I felt awful. 

The thing I seem to struggle with is how there is no real 'limit' on natural sugar. I don't actually consume much added sugar, for example today I only had one bowl of cereal, and my sugar consumption consisted of:

Natural sugars: 
12g milk
10g mixed vegetables
5g banana 
3g sweetcorn
2g broccoli 
1g lettuce

Added sugars:
4g granola bar 
4g giant yorkshire pudding
2g bread
2g tortilla wraps

I apologize if I've mixed some of the stuff up, but roughly today I've consumed 33g of natural sugar, and 12g of added sugars. But all I focus on, is the fact that I've consumed about 45g of sugar today! And my mind just tells me that's a lot. 

For some reason - whether right or wrong - my brain wants me to limit ALL my sugar intake to ~30g. And the obvious solution would be to swap the milk for unsweetened almond milk. 

I've tried this before on my cereal and whilst it didn't make me gag, I certainly didn't enjoy eating it. However, I'm sure if I stuck with it for a week, I could get used to the taste. But my question is - is it worth it? Is it worth swapping my dairy milk for almond milk, in order to reduce my overall sugar intake to around 30g per day?

If you've somehow read this far then thanks so much, I really apologize for how muddled/confusing this post may be.

"Improving health during Ramadan, proper nutrition","Well, God-willing Ramadan will be upon us soon and fasting during daylight hours commences. 

I wanted to know if others had thoughts they might share on how to best improve health during the month of fasting, be it through foods, supplements, other, etc.  Particularly I hope to improve the gut, but overall health in general.

I feel quite fortunate and blessed in that fasting gives sense of renewal spiritually, bodily and energy-wise, especially at the completion of the month.  

Supplement-wise, right now I take and have available some Hawaiian spirulina, matcha root pills, tumeric pills, a multi-vitamin, milk thistle(don't take that often).  I also have some apple cider vinegar which I am not using, though i had been taking some kombucha more recently, but don't plan on using more any time soon.  Also have some grass-fed why protein. 

Other than food, health-wise, I think the break for the body from food itself is such a relief in fact, though yes at times certainly challenging.  I hope to exercise at times - run and perhaps strength train or walk - towards then of the day so that breaking fast is near and the body can be replenished with water and food.

Low carb vs low fat(your experiance),"Not looking for an argument,converstion attempts ,or bashing of one or the other. I simply would like to hear your anecdotal experience with each one. How you felt, how effective it was for whatever goal you mights have, and any other thoughts you would care to share. 

I have done both quite extensively and have decent wilpower when it comes to dieting. So my low fat was truly low fat and low carb was either  no or sub 10 grams. 

Last time I went low carb was about a year and a half ago. Went from about 210 lbs to around 180. A good chunk of this was water. A decent amount was fat, and quite a bit was muscle. I would consume maybe 80 grams protein a day and the rest fat. The only carbs I got were from what some high fat moderate protein foods naturally had. This was about a 3 month period. 

In that time frame I had a sense of calm. I was not very hungry at all. But I did not have explosice energy. I could not function at a high level in short bursts. My thinking was not as sharp but like I said things felt calmer. I was also not as strong. Working out was a chore. At first it was cool to be able to eat fatty foods in large amount but after a while I really missed bread and would get nauseous if something was too greasy. I had to abandon due to high blood pressure.

Low fat I just started for the first time about a month ago. Eating from 2200-2800 cals a day. My weight is about the same as it was then. Constantly hovering around 205 in the morning, but can go from anywhere from 202 to 211 depending on how much and how recently I ate/pooped.

 Energy is much better. I feel better. It is easier to satiated myself. Amount of food is larger and feels more ""solid"" a typical days macros look something like 200-250 grams protein 400-500 grams carbs and maybe 7-8 grams fat. Have a lot of explosive energy and strength. Thinking is also sharper and quicker. Muscles are fuller and do not look flat or feel weak. Apatite is higher and I eat more often. Finally even though my weight is staying the same I am losing a lot of fat. Not quite as quick as the keto. But the water is not going anywhere and I am not only retaining muscle but building more of it. And muscles are alos harder.

Is 3200-3300 kcal enough for me to build muscle ?,"Hi, I was visiting gym for some time in the past but I started again after 3 years. I am visiting gym last 12 months with some breaks, so let's say in last 12 months I was visiting gym 8 months \(now it's 3 months in a row\).  I read some articles about how to calculated calories per day to build muscle and I ended with number around 3200\-3000 kcal per day. People say me that I look bigger but my weight is still more less around 95kg so I am not sure if i should not eat more.

 I am 27, 95kg \(with some belly fat :\)\), 196cm.  I train 3 times per week full body training, mainly with free weights. My training is about 45\-60 minutes. I am working as programmer so I am not much a active during the day but I walk to my job and I also spent time with kids outdoor, so I usually do around  8k\-10k steps a day in average.

I eat quite health, no fast food, homemade food \(rise, potatoes, pasta, cheese, nuts, meat, milk, protein\) with enough vegetables, fruits. Fats around 1\-1.2/kg, carbohydrates around 3\-3.5/kg and proteins around 1.8\-2/kg.

Spirulina affects an athlete's immune system,"An athlete's immune system can be negatively impacted due to strenuous exercise, making them more prone to infections. A recent study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition compared athletes taking spirulina supplements, and a placebo group not taking them.
After the six weeks, the spirulina group had a constant T-cell count, whereas those not taking spirulina showed unhealthy changes in T-cell count. This showed that spirulina may have protective properties from the effects of strenuous exercise.

Atypical reaction to Magnesium Citrate (200mg/day) - feels like a strong CNS dopaminergic stimulant and makes me aggressive,"I am a 19 year old male. I suppose that I have multiple nutritional deficiencies because of poor diet (working to improve that). 

I tried taking Magnesium Citrate multiple times, just 200mg, and every time I have a very strong reaction which goes completely against everything I heard about it. About 2 hours after taking 200mg of Magnesium Citrate, I start to feel almost slightly ""hypomanic"" - I become hyperactive, speak louder, am more extroverted, have more confidence, feel euphoric, and also am behaving more aggressively.

I also feel more physical energy: It feels like my leg muscles have more energy in them and as a result, I find it easier to walk long distances in a higher rate. Without Magnesium, my legs usually feel slightly ""heavy"", but on Magnesium my legs feel very light.

I am also taking stimulant medication for ADHD; Ritalin. In the first few weeks of the Ritalin, I felt quite euphoric and confident, but this has went away as I built tolerance.

The effects of the Magnesium Citrate now closely resemble those that the Ritalin had before I built tolerance to it. I know Magnesium can reduce stimulant tolerance, but Magnesium gives me these effects even in days I don't take any Ritalin at all.

I feel good on it, but am also quite worried. I noticed that I am a lot more angry - I tend to be a relatively gentle person, but I suddenly find myself shouting at people and responding more offensively to confrontations. My language is harsher as well, and I am more in a ""fighter mode"".

I tried taking higher doses, like 400mg/day, and this only makes things worse. Furthermore, after a few days on 400mg/day, I start getting muscle cramps and heart palpitations (a constant ""sinking feeling"" in my chest, as if I heard bad news about something I did).

I enjoy the positive effects of it, such as extroversion and euphoria, but I dislike the increased aggression. I shout at people for minor things, and I say awful things I later regret (I'm not violent, though).

I've considered this can possibly be caused by something else unrelated to Magnesium, but I had this experience so many times, I'm sure that this is the cause of it. I'm currently taking only Melatonin (at night), Ritalin and Magnesium. Even if I don't take the Melatonin and the Ritalin, and only take Magnesium, I still get these effects.

What can possibly cause this? Did anyone else have this happen? Can I do something to reduce this side effect?",nutrition,1525374801,Bartobam,1,1,True,2018-05-03

Does eating fat actually translate to gaining fat (or at least increasing bodyfat % in body composition)?,"I mean obviously not eating fat in excess, but let's say you stay at your maintenance calories, does eating fat make you gain fat?

The reason that people stay away from eating fatty food is that fat is high in calories, making it easier to hit a caloric surplus, which means weight gain (but this is different than fat gain?). 

So let's say you eat fatty food but just less of it (so you are at maintenance calories, not a surplus), you wouldn't gain weight..

But what I'm wondering is the difference between gaining weight vs gaining bodyfat (so body composition)... Even if you don't gain weight (since you're at maintenance calories), is it possible that eating a higher proportion of fat in your diet leads to higher bodyfat % in body composition? Or is it not directly related, depends on other factors?

For example, let's say you stick to maintenance calories (like 1500 calories) so your weight remains constant, but say 75% of those calories come from fat. Would you have more body fat % than compared to if you eat those same 1500 calories but only 20% of those calories are from fat?

Maybe the question is, does bodyfat come from what you eat, or is it strictly based on quantity of calories?",nutrition,1525377188,abedfilms,29,9,True,2018-05-03

2. Is cold water bad for our health?

Weight loss/ healthy nutrition post surgery?,"Hey guys! Long time lurker here. I have been into health and fitness since getting out of highschool. I was into cardio and Pilates for a long time, but over the past year have been more and more into lifting.
I have a history of eating disorders, but I have kept good track for about 5 months now.
I am currently 137 lbs, 5'5, lower body fat than I've been before but still not certain of the percentage.

However, there is quite a bit of downtime that comes with this surgery. Apparently no exercise whatsoever for 3 weeks. Then very light exercise until about two weeks after that. Fully getting back into weghtlifting, heavy cardio, or anything that will increase the heart rate risks tearing of the stitches or the wounds opening (yay me)

"Is Milk Bad? And if so, what to use as a substitute?","So I used GOMAD to go from 130lbs to 190lbs in basically 7 months, and for a long time it helped me maintain mass as I became a more healthy individual.

Now, I have cut milk out of my diet, focusing on drinking water as my beverage of choice, and filling up my caloric needs with vegetables and fruit rather than lactose. 

I do believe this has made me a healthier person - that milk isn't 'bad' per se, but it isn't good. When I crave a high calorie drink, I make myself a fruit smoothie.

However, when I make these fruit smoothies, I need to add a liquid... and I'd prefer it to be a high calorie liquid. Which could be milk.

But I was curious if it was 'healthier', meaning more nutritional content and micros, to use something else. Unsweetened almond milk, et cetera, anything like that.

I DO NOT CARE ABOUT MACROS. I know in terms of macros, milk is a godsend. This is about micros. I believe for short-term weight goals, IIFYM works just fine. My weight management is (mostly) fine now and not my focus. 

Also I know lactose intolerance is a thing. I believe I'm lactose intolerant but I don't mind pooping. I like pooping. I poop 3 times before I leave the door in the morning even if I don't have dairy and I poop pretty much immediately after finishing any meal (not that I HAVE to, but I uhh, want to).

Discomfort after overindulgence,"To start off, I maintain a pretty steady diet of mostly minimally-processed plant foods, some dairy and some meat. I also do both HIIT and strength training a couple of times a week. I drink mainly water and coffee. I shoot for 7 hours of sleep every night also. This has been my thing for about 5 years now. 

I couldn’t be happier with this routine, but there is one problem:

Eventually an evening outing or holiday comes around and I overindulge in whatever unhealthy fats, sugars and beer I run into. Once I decide to get back on my routine, I end up dealing with at least 5 days of a bloated belly, bloodshot eyes, extreme fatigue, irritability and depression. No amount of water, exercise, sleep or healthy foods seems to get rid of it or speed up the process. 

My question is, does anyone know of something I can do to speed up this recovery? Do I have to just wait it out every time? It really puts a damper on my productivity and moods.

How bad are artificial sweeteners for the body?,"For example, drinking coca cola is bad no matter we drink diet coke (no sugar) or normal coke. 

If you look on the ingredients, you get even more scared seeing all the chemicals and extra artificial sweeteners. 

Also, if you look at energy drink, they also developed a category of no sugar energy drinks and no calories. (Examples: monster energy, red bull). 

They are really tempting because the taste is similar but they have no sugar and calories, but do they affect the body worse than a normal energy drink considering the extra scary chemicals they add?

Every chemical is bad for the body, I’m just curious if the ‘diet’ version of drinks is more dangerous than the normal one. 

(To justify my question, I heard right from a doctor that on a long term, if a healthy person drinks ‘no sugary drinks’ that contain a lot of other artificial sweeteners, they will create an inbalance on the insulin. 

As in artificial sweeteners are very bad for a healthy person and it can induce diabetes over time on the principle:

(that’s just an exagerated example to explain the argument) : you eat 10 cakes everyday that have no sugar but only artificial sweeteners. Your insulin doesn’t react as you would have eaten cakes with sugar.  

After years of having this habbit, if there comes a period when you eat more sugary foods or drink, your insulin - that became ‘lazy’ over the years, now gets confused, it starts to overwork itself. Over time it cam lead to diabetes faster than if you ate sugar on a daily basis in average quantities.)

Did i do my math correct? Cooking in bulk.,"So today i wanted to make some ground beef with broccoli for my meal prep tomorrow. One thing that i forgot to do was weigh out the ground beef before cooking it. After i cooked it all, i weighed the whole product on my food scale, and got 332g cooked(minus the bowl). From there i proceeded to divide it by 4, the amount of servings. I ended up with 83g of cooked ground beef as the result.

Can someone explain the mechanism behind alcohol use eliminating carbohydrate cravings?,"TL;DR - Someone with lifelong carb cravings, always needed carbs throughout the day, therefore preferenced a high-carb diet, introduces alcohol into their daily routine and suddenly doesn't have any carb cravings the day after drinking. This is only having two glasses of wine at night. Since then, they have begun drinking two glasses a night every single night.

Is it better to eat on a deficit/weigh as little as possible eating junk foods or eat a standard amount of healthier foods and maintain a high (yet healthy range)bmi?,"A lot of the posts I see on fitness and weight loss subreddits seem to encourage CICO because it works. And it does, for sure! But oftentimes, the goal weights of those posting are in the lower healthy BMI range and the goal seems to be to simply get there. 

My question is, would it be better to set a goal of perhaps a BMI of 23, but on a very whole diet or something like Paleo, or to set a goal of a BMI of 19 eating 1200 calories including an entire pint of halotop and fast food daily?

I'm basically maintaining right now (bmi 19.2-19.4) and focuses more on muscle and toning, but I guess the crux of this question is, is the net benefit greater being as small as possible or as nourished in diet as possible, even if that translates to a little extra body fat?

Why aren't balanced macro whole food diets more popular than low fat or low carb diets?,"I read a lot of opinions on this sub and other resources. The vast majority of people seem to fall into one of two camps:

1. Low carb, high fat (e.g. keto) with macros resembling 65-70% fat, 20-25% protein, 5-10% carbs

2. Whole food, plant based (vegan) usually with an emphasis on high carb, low fat, low to moderate protein with macros resembling 65-70% carbs, 10-20% protein, 10-20% fat (or 80/10/10 as some people follow).


The common theme between them seems to be emphasis on *whole foods* (unrefined), and low to moderate protein intake. Both groups are encouraged to eat leafy greens and vegetables, and where possible (and where affordable), to eat organic.

**However..**

Why does there seem to be less support for a balance macro, whole foods diet? Is there some scientific/nutritional reason why consuming moderate amounts of carbs, protein and fat isn't optimal?

We know that carbs are the body's preferred fuel source and that both carbs and fats are needed for optimum brain and organ function. Protein isn't needed in high amounts, but moderate protein intake is good for maintaining lean muscle mass and recovery/repair of muscles.

A lot of people decide to limit carbs as they experience lethargy, 'brain fog' and blood sugar/insulin resistance related issues. A lot of people decide to limit fat due to the debate over saturated fat and cholesterol intake associated with high fat being linked to CVD, especially animal products - but this is obviously a very divisive subject with studies for and against saturated fat intake. Other types of fat (excl. trans) are generally accepted as being beneficial in at least small/moderate quanties.

But nearly everyone agrees that we need *some* fat, and a lot of people would say we need *some* carbs.


I'm aware that the SAD (Standard American Diet) is more of a balanced macro diet, but is obviously high in added sugar, refined/heavily processed foods and oil heavy.

I'm also aware that, in nature, humans are the only species that consume moderate/high quantities of both carbs and fat.

But why isn't a balanced macro, whole foods diet more popular? Eating close to 33/33/33 in macros, ensuring moderate (but not high) amounts of any macro to fulfill the body's needs, but only consuming whole foods, eliminating added sugars, processed foods and added oils? 


Obviously eating this way would involve consuming moderate amounts of fat + carbs at the same time, and could potentially include animal products too, but would also work for a plant based only diet.

* Are there any papers/studies out there that conclude a balanced macro diet is a negative thing?

* Why do people tend to either eat low carb/high fat or high fat/low carb?

* Even if there is compelling evidence that there are conflicts between consuming moderate/high carbs and fats in a diet, would this still be an issue if eating at a caloric deficit?",nutrition,1521574636,bachus2015,13,4,True,2018-03-20

As a result of the lice infestations, the global price of salmon has soared, and world production fallen.

Is it ok for me to start taking Men’s Multivitamins?,"I figured this was the best subreddit for this, so here we go:

"Critique My Diet - The ""Whatever"" Diet",,nutrition,1521763990,[deleted],1,1,True,2018-03-22
"The ""Whatever"" Diet","Are there any known implications of a diverse and sporadic diet? I couldn't find much info anywhere, since most studies and discussions adhere to specific diets. I'll explain what I mean.



I'm not talking about a yo-yo diet, where weight is sporadically gained and lost. I'm talking about sporadic in the sense that one day you have a lot of carbs, the next day a lot of fat, then a lot of protein the next day, or any combination of the three on random days. This also applies to micronutrients from plants; i.e., eat a lot of bananas one day, more cruciferous veggies the next day, more carrots the next day, etc. Let’s call it the “whatever” diet.



The only consistencies are: (1) getting as much calories as you need, and (2) within the course of ~1 week you make sure to get some averaged combination of everything. E.g., you realized you haven’t had any good sources of iron in the past few days so you eat some steak or some black beans. You basically don’t get a lot of anything, but you also get some of everything. 



Are there any known implications of such a diet?

"Why are most people on this sub either low fat/high carb or high fat/low carb, and not something in-between?","Most of the replies on here are either pro-ketogenic (low carb, high fat), or whole food plant based/vegan and follow a high carb, low fat diet.

Why do people go to one extreme or the other? Why aren't more people ""in-between"" and consume moderate amounts of both macros? Is there a nutritional/scientific reason why?

Athletes tend to eat moderate/high amounts of carbs and 'healthy' fats, but don't seem to get criticised for their diets - probably due to the amount of exercise/training they do which in some way counteracts their diet.

So if someone was as active as an athlete (e.g. training 5/6 times a week), would that counteract the negatives of moderate/high fat and carb diet?

Anyone know the species of mackerel in the can?,"[Polar brand](https://www.jcsalesweb.com/ProductImages/large/16185.jpg).

Edit: Ok, a bit of detective work and found out it's Jack Mackerel according to their site and according to wiki:

""Pacific jack mackerel tastes similar to canned sardines. It may be used interchangeably with salmon or tuna in recipes. Jack mackerel is considered safer to consume than tuna because it is a smaller fish, and not a top predator, thus avoiding accumulation of heavy metals such as mercury.[citation needed]""

Blood sugar and soaked/fermented grains,"Everywhere, I'm reading that fermenting grains by soaking with a slightly acidic solution will, over time, destroy anti-nutrients, eliminate phytic acid, and improve nutrient absorption, as well as lowering the glycemic index...

However, in my case, it seems the glycemic index is greatly increased with fermented sourdough (wheat) and oats, but not rice.

Sourdough (50% bleached, 50% unbleached), fermented oatmeal, unfermented rice: 1 hour after consuming, I start feeling very tired, for several hours, sometimes to the point that I feel my heart pounding pretty hard and struggling, which makes me think it could be causing high blood pressure.

Regular bread, unfermented oatmeal and fermented rice cause me no such issue.

But just about every study points to me being crazy.
Can the same food affect blood sugar so differently from one person to another with different preparation methods? My body right now hardly produce enzymes or acidity on its own, so I supplement it with citric acid and alpha-amylase for the above, no matter if fermented or not.

And I know it's bad, but the oats I have are quick oats, and unfortunately I still have 5-6 months of the stuff left to go through. (thanks COSTCO)",nutrition,1521860197,SnugglyCatLady,2,0,True,2018-03-23

Trouble digesting fats,"Hey all, first post here. I am having trouble digesting fats, it seems. Need help on figuring out what the hell the problem is. 
Do I need digestive enzymes? Ox bile?
Or...??

I have what may be colitis and have had bouts of cdiff for the past 6yrs, both started about the same time, doctors believe colitis gave way for cdiff to grow. Cdiff is now negative (thank the Lord) for over 3 months now. Colonoscopies show inflammation..
Anyways..

-I'm male, 28yrs old. 

-Healthy diet, no junk food/processed. 

-99% of what I eat is home-cooked. 

-No drugs/alcohol/smoking. 

-About 2-5bms daily, some better shaped than others.  

I cant seem to handle fat from meats and even all natural peanut butter.  

My doctor is useless and will not address this from another point, she keeps pushing IV drugs on me. 

Stools are normal color but always on the soft side for the most part, but I notice I go more when I eat fatty meat and even natural peanut butter (peanut and salt as only ingredients). I doubt its a peanut allergy..unless I developed it somehow in these recent years. 

What do y'all think about digestive enzymes for my situation? How about lipase in specific? Or ox bile? 
Just want some insight on what the heck the problem is, or rather how to address it.

There doesn't seem to be a single answer on the right diet.,"I just watched What the health, this partially vegan propaganda film makes claims about sugar &amp; carbs not being as dangerous as new research makes it out to be, which in turn they target diary &amp; meat products. 

We were taught for decades that fat is the enemy. Now low carb diets like Bulletproof &amp; Keto put the blame on carbs, grains &amp; sugar.

It's exhausting listen to these teams debate and argue each other, both seem to be suffering from some confirmation bias, they're like a unified team almost reaching cult status. I find it difficult to believe anyone's word anymore, even trusted doctors.

I'm under the assumption that we western countries as a whole, consume too much meat &amp; dairy and not nearly enough vegetables. But aside from that, I'm relatively clueless on where to proceed anymore.

This is my main (and only) problem with the ketogenic diet.,"I've been doing LCHF, or what some may call keto, on and off for about 6 months the past year. Initially I came for the weight loss, but ended up going back for the added mental benefits that I lost going back to a traditional high carb diet.

My problem with keto is the rationale of taking in massive fat macros, and the missing logic behind it. A standard keto macro breakdown is something like 75% F/ 20% P/ 5% C.

The logic behind the low carbs is that as hunter-gatherers we didn't have access to the amount of carbs we do today. That makes sense, but how in the world would we have had access to that many fats?

What's worse: a small amount of sugar or a large amount of a high GI food?,"From what I understand, sugar is mainly bad because it is absorbed rapidly into the bloodstream, causing a large insulin spike. This rapid absorption is also why it is more likely to be stored as fat, particularly abdominal fat, which is associated with a higher risk of various diseases. I know there are other reasons why sugar is bad (habit forming tendecies, empty calories, etc.) but this seems to be the main thing.

By the same theme, this is also why lower GI foods are considered healthier, and why sugar in fruit isn't considered an issue - slower absorption.

Seeing as how all carbs are essentially sugar with various breakdown times, what does this mean when comparing foods' sugar content, especially since rate of digestion is affected by things like fiber and presence of other macronutrients? Basically, when only considering this insulin spike and the storage of fat, which is worse - a food that has a small amount of sugar (I'm not sure what would be considered small, I guess &lt;5g) but is primarily another macronutrient or has an at least equivalent amount of fiber (like a protein shake or a piece of whole grain bread) or a high GI food that is almost completely carbs but has no sugar?

Obviously a potato is different from a bag of chips, and commercial peanut butter is different from no sugar added greek yogurt, but I guess let's assume micronutrients, etc. aren't an issue.",nutrition,1522151597,beewinq,19,30,True,2018-03-27
Is Refined Sugar Really THAT Bad In Excess (Greater Than 25g per Day). Where Is The Research and What Does It Say?,"I have asked this question on both /r/AskScience and /r/AskScienceDiscussion and received no response. It was suggested I try here (I didn't know this sub existed).

Sugar has been in the headlines a lot in the last year or so. I keep reading mixed information about it. On one hand you've got someone like [Robert Lustig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM) and a few [other](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/about-dr-rhonda-patrick) doctors/reasearchers, who have exemplary credentials, claiming sugar is pretty much the worst thing ever. There are also non-scientists like [Gary Taubes](http://garytaubes.com/) who are in the same camp.


Then there are people who say we're completely overblowing the harmful effects of sugar and that it's really not *that* bad and/or doesn't do the things he claims it does. This is usually [bloggers](http://www.alanaragonblog.com/2010/01/29/the-bitter-truth-about-fructose-alarmism/) and [skeptics](http://anthonycolpo.com/sweet-stupidity-part-2-the-bitter-truth-about-robert-lustigs-anti-sugar-claims/). Of course then there are the groups of researchers or organizations who claim this as well, such as the British Nutrition Foundation, but as I looked through their site, I found they are [sponsored by some of the biggest sugary food producers in the world](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/supporters/memberorganisations.html).


Then there's the middle of the road people who say ""it's OK... to a point... BUT yes, it causes a host of physiological issues that go well beyond gaining a few pounds"" (such as fatty liver, links to Alzheimer's, metabolic disorder, increased cholesterol, etc). This is from sites like the CDC and WHO. 


As a layperson, I don't even know where to start. More and more these days we talk about ""fake news"" but it goes so much beyond politics. Anyone can say anything online (including you and I!) and it's hard to know who *actually* knows what they're talking about.

Magnesium Chloride and Magnesium Citrate,"Hi,

I was reviewing an article that was involving the role of magnesium with patients suffering from back pain, which led me to the literature below. Let's just say given for the sake of my question, the following was proved true - Control Groups given MG Chloride found a great reduction in muslce pain.

My question is regarding the types of Magnesium. I was eager to try so I went to CVS and got Mag Citrate which says it provides 250mg or 100% of the DV.

But the article specifically states it uses Mag Chloride, which I could only find on Amazon.

Does ACV make you drunk?,"Silly question. My girlfriend and I last night made stir fry, had golden milk, but before both took a shot of vinegar.

Now I didn't read the label for the correct shot size and poured an actual 2 oz shot of ACV and we both took it down. Then realized holy heck! We need water, or strawberries, something to wash this down because it burned so hard.

Afterwards we both felt a bit tipsy from the experience. We had no alcohol or any other substance.

Concern over BPA replacement linings used in canned sardines.,"So it seems most canned foods have BPA in the lining, no biggie the only canned food I use are chickpeas to make hummus. 

For the last year I've been eating a lot of sardines. The main brand of canned sardines I buy is Wild Planet and it's listed as BPA free on the packaging. 

From doing some research someone contacted the company and found that they use *PVC copolymer* as lining, like many other companies now. 

As stated on the site **""This is clearly a regrettable 
substitute, because PVC is a polymer made from vinyl 
chloride, a known carcinogen.""**

Is this danger exaggerated or should I be concerned about eating a lot of canned sardines? Just because vinyl chloride is a carcinogen doesn't necessarily mean that a PVC co-polymer would be as well? Right? I really don't know. 


They have become an important part of my diet and don't want to be concerned every time I open the can now.

Many sources claim that saturated fats are bad, and that due to them cholesterol levels tend to go up. Other sources claim that this is not true, and it is hence hard to find an answer - this is sort of like the whole 'dietary cholesterol is bad' issue. I'm a bit concerned because I'm eating around 55g of saturated fats (271% of my daily dose) per day (2 liters of milk - 180%, 7 eggs - 56%, 100g of peanuts - 35%).

There's not a lot out there, what comes up quickly seems fluff, and if there is anything solidly researched, I'm not finding it.  So you know, regular nutrition stuff.  

I'm NOT talking about 'nose hunger' or 'eye hunger' or that kind of thing.  I'm talking about.... maybe hungers where you're hungry but can wait, or hungers that are more urgent and harder to put off, things like that.  Delineating types, and any information about what the deficiency is of (eg- what the hunger is for:  Which macro nutrient, any particular micros or vitamins, etc.).  

Doesn't have to be a full on research article, (although those are good, too), but looking for something more involved than a pop-sci article on 'beating hunger', or those 'nose' types (ugh.).

"Does grinding oats, nuds and seeds remove their beneficial properties?","*spelling mistake in title: ""nuds"" but I meant nuts**

In a grinder I like to put oats, cashews, almonds, hazelnuts, nuts, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, flax seeds and a pinch of cinnamon on top of it all, then I press the button for 10-15 seconds which blends all of that into a nice and pretty beige powder. Then I put the powder in a bowl and pour a bit of Soy milk with a banana sliced on top of the mix. It's delicious.

As I did this for an afternoon snack earlier, I wondered; does grinding nuts, oats and seeds could be destroying or removing any good or beneficial properties from them? Is it actually a good idea? Should I instead consume the oats, seeds and nuts as they are instead of a powder version of them?

I started doing this two weeks ago because I had a tooth removal surgery and I could only eat very mushy things so I started grinding most of my food. I can now eat solid food again but this mix is the only one I kept doing because it's easier/faster to eat this way and the fact everything is grounded together gives it a special taste, a better taste in my opinion...

"Are vitamins and fiber the only benefits of green, leafy vegetables?","I was raised by a hardcore health nut, which means I ate a TON of salad and vegetables as a kid. The end result of this was that I developed a taste for vegetables and genuinely enjoy eating salads as an adult. Because I eat a lot of these kinds of foods, I'm always eager to read articles talking about how great they are for you. The thing is, I've noticed that pretty much all these articles ever say about green leafies and other ""superfoods"" is they're super rich in vitamins and minerals, and sometimes that their high fiber content helps curb appetite and aids in digestion. My problem with this is those really aren't that great of benefits for most Americans. I'm pretty sure I don't have a vitamin deficiency, as with most people who eat the highly diversified Western diet, and my poops make it pretty clear I get way more fiber than I need. Are these really the only benefits of green leafy vegetables? It sounds pretty underwhelming considering they could be replicated by a multivitamin and some Metamucil. I know vitamins actually in food are absorbed a lot better than pills, but it really doesn't matter if I'm getting enough vitamins to begin with.

I bought brown rice yesterday. After copying the nutrition infos to my food-chart (I plan my meals with that) I couldn't believe that it just has 1/3 of the calories my regular white rice has. I did some research because I thought it's just to good to be true and found out, that brown rice has in fact the same or even a bit more calories than traditional white rice. I was confused, did I copy the nutrition facts for the white rice wrong? I double checked and no, it is correct. The parboiled white rice I always buy has in fact 650 kcal per cup (or 351 kcal/100g). How's that even possible? I googled and most sources say white rice has around 234 kcal per cup or 130 kcal/100g.

The rice is from a discounter, the packaging just says ""parboiled"" and ""long-grain"". It isn't instant-rice either (requires 16 minutes cooking). Further research showed me, that this rice is produced by Riso Scotti S.p.A. It seems to be a re-branded version of this one, at least the nutrition-label looks the same: http://www.risoscotti.com/products/38/large-retailers/classical-golden-rice

Should You Really Start Eating More Saturated Fat?,"[Should You Really Start Eating More Saturated Fat?](https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19484751/saturated-fat-health/)

""Yet a growing tally of studies seems to suggest that it is neither, calling decades of assumptions about saturated fat into question. One was a meta-analysis in 2014 that looked at 76 studies—27 of them randomized, controlled trials, the gold standard for research—and found that ""current evidence"" doesn't support limiting saturated fats in favor of PUFAs.

Another analysis the next year showed no link between saturated fat intake and mortality from all causes, including cardiovascular disease, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. ""Saturated fat used to be public-health enemy number one,"" says David Ludwig, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. ""But it's neither that nor exactly a health food. It's kind of a neutral."" ""

I have seen cookbooks from the 60s and 70s and they use way too much aspic but overall the point of the article is that the general dietary plans people followed were perhaps healthier than what happened from the changes to more O6 PUFA vegetable seed oils, and the increase in processed carbohydrates.

The smart label calories link for it is: https://smartlabel.labelinsight.com/product/4494678/nutrition

It has 5 servings with 60 calories per serving. So, the whole can is 300 calories. (20 oz can)

It's 50/50 if I drink the juice inside on a given day, or only eat the pineapple.

**My questions:** How ""healthy"" is this compared to just cutting pineapple on your own? 

Also, per serving, it has 14 grams of sugar. That accounts to *70 grams* of sugar. I understand fruit inherently has sugar in it, but is this a normal amount to consume in a 24 hour period? I can't shake the feeling it's a lot and if I cut up pineapples myself it would be less sugar. 

Biggest question: What percentage of calories and sugar comes from ONLY the pineapple juice, and what percent from the fruit itself? In other words, if I only eat the fruit, what's the calories for that? 

I like cans because it's always ready waiting for me to eat it, helps me measure the calories so that's why I don't just cut pineapples, and also is cheaper for a weeks worth compared to the cutting it myself.

"Should one strive to eat all colours of vegetables and fruits daily, or should/can it be stretched out over a week?","From what I read online, one should eat about about 3 cups of vegetables and fruits each a day (I forgot how many servings this totalled to), but I didn't see any specific colours of produce that should be eaten. I'm aware different colours have different types of nutrients and it's best to eat a diverse palette as possible, but considering you have not only two different types of produce to eat but also red, orange, purple, starchy, as well as green produce to eat, it seems overwhelming to pursue eating all of this every day. Could eating these colours of produce be stretched out over a  week? I saw from a video that an adult should eat around 2 cups of green produce, 6 cups of red/orange produce, 6 cups of starchy produce, as well as 4~6 cups of other types of produce (white/purple/blue produce).

The reason I'm asking this is because I want to eat particular pairs of colours of produce every day, e.g. orange/red and green on one day, then maybe purple/blue produce with starchy produce on another day, etc. I would aim to stretch this out at least 5 days of the week, but potentially 7 days out of the week. However I would understand if it's necessary to eat a more diverse, perhaps the entire rainbow of produce daily since the body may need those nutrients daily rather than waiting throughout the week.

Tapwater is healthier than purified water?,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495189/

According to the article, There is a variety of ionized minerals which are apparently more bioavailable in tapwater.

I read that small amounts of minerals such as lithium is required for the healthy function of the human body and brain.

I've been drinking water purified through an osmosis filter. Very pure and delicious.

However, maybe tapwater is healthier and people should be drinking it every day instead.

The city I live in does not flouridate it's water and the water is very hard often leaving residues all over my damn car when the sprinklers are on and on the faucets.

Tapwater does seem way more natural than purified water, and naturallness is sometimes a good indicator for healthiness.

Help interpreting nutrition labels? Specifically for vitamins and minerals.,"I'm trying to pay more attention to the amount of iron in my diet. I'm not anemic (that I know of) but I'm often tired. Either way I doubt that I get the 18 grams recommended for a menstruating woman. Men and children need less than half of that, which makes reading a nutrition label SO frustrating. 

Things like calcium, iron, vitamin A etc. are only listed by their % of RDA. I've been searching for exactly what those are and only coming up with tables with amounts based on age. When a label says it has 10% of the RDA for iron is that out of 8 grams or 18? Same for the other minerals and vitamins. Is there a table somewhere that lists the official amounts these labels are referring to?

I'd say that 90 percent of the time I use coconut oil. I also use a tsp of regular olive oil to poach my eggs in the morning (I can't do it normally so I use a poaching cup and this stops the egg sticking). And I often use sesame oil if in cooking stir fry or noodle-based fried food.

"How long is vitamin D ""stored"" for?","I've done a lot of reading about vitamin D the past few days but unbelievably I haven't been able to find any information about how long vitamin D is stored for. So if the recommended dose of vitamin D is 1,000IU to 4,000IU+ per day and I get 20,000IU in a single day, how long would that be ""good"" for? I know a lot of people are going to dodge the question and just tell me something along the lines of ""it'd be best to go in the sun everyday"" - well of course but I'm talking about something like if I get 20,000IU from the sun on Monday then there are hardcore thunderstorms for like 4 days straight, would I be totally OK because of all the vitamin D I received on Monday or should I start to be concerned in that situation? One thing that makes me especially curious about this question is that I’ve heard that in Europe it’s basically impossible to receive any vitamin D from the sun in the winter months. I don’t live in Europe but this makes me think about the people who lived in Europe in ancient times. These people went for months and months with literally no vitamin D from the sun (only depending on the small amounts of vitamin D in food)? Or they relied on “stored” vitamin D? I know that white people can receive vitamin D more easily than black people but are they better at “storing” it also? Or is this BS?

Also, if I'm covered from neck to toe in clothes, I would still receive vitamin D by walking around in the sun, correct? Obviously not as much as if I were barely clothed, but the sunlight I'd receive on my face would produce vitamin D for my entire body, right? I know that sounds stupid but I really have no idea how vitamin D works - is it specific to certain parts of the body (I assume it isn't but just want to make sure)? Thanks a lot.

Questions on probiotic foods (not supplements),"So I'm working on rebuilding my gut flora and adding more diversity to my diet. But I'm wondering a couple things on probiotics that I couldn't find clear answers to online. Though I know it's a fresh area for research and maybe there are no clear answers yet.

1) Does it matter when you eat probiotic foods?

Should they be eaten before (or between) meals, when stomach acid is at its weakest? Or is there no difference if you eat it with/after a meal?

2) Should different probiotic foods be eaten separately, at different meals?

Would eating them together be an overload of competing bacteria or cause any digestion/absorption issues? Like, say, miso soup and kimchi/sauerkraut. (Obviously I don't know enough of the biology here.)

3) How many servings per day or week is enough? Is 1 serving every meal too much?

4) Is there a hierarchy of probiotics? Considering some are quite expensive (esp. organic), are they basically equal in cost/benefit? Or are some better 'staples', and some better only on occasion?

Miso, for example, has a small serving size. Does it have a relatively high amount of probiotic bacteria, then? Or is it just naturally a lower dose of different strains?",nutrition,1518917890,WuShuMu,7,7,True,2018-02-17

How to deal with spinach and other high-oxalate foods?,"What's the best way to counteract those [oxalates](http://www.wakehealth.edu/Urology/Kidney-Stones/Oxalate-Content-of-Foods.htm), which end-up giving you kidney stones? I rarely see people talk about oxalates when discussing healthy foods or keto diets, and the idea for this thread was given to me by seeing that so many people like ""spinach smoothies"" in a different thread here. Raw spinach contains like 20x the oxalates compared to most other veggies, and even boiled it's like 10x.

Would adding half a lemon or a whole lemon to one of those smoothies do much? Should we also avoid taking any form of calcium (dairy, supplements, etc) when we drink that smoothie or eat spinach?

It's such a shame because spinach is a great-looking super-food and I was planning on eating it three times a week myself until I learned more about its oxalates content. However, I'm not sure the benefits outweigh its high-level of oxalates unless someone has a suggestion for how to eliminate say 80-90% of the oxalates in it.

Why are the signs of micro-nutrient deficiency so insidious?,"Just out of curiosity, sparked by observing others diets, what happens to people that refuse to eat vegetables?

Another quick example was a guy I worked for. He was 22 and had the worst diet I have ever seen.

Although he certainly didn't have an athletic figure, he was normal weight, intelligent, slept well, rarely sick and seemed to have good testosterone levels - judging by his thick beard and chest hair pouring out of his shirt.

Question about calorie intake on weekends using MyFitnessPal,"So a little background, I have a very physical job. I clean houses 5 days a week Mon-Fri and I’m actively cleaning for about 4-6 hours a day. I’ve been using MyFitnessPal to track my calories and I set my activity to ‘not very active’ because other than my job I’m not too active. I’m 5’3, used to be 155 lbs and now I’m down to 125lbs in the last year. So my calorie intake is 1200 a day without cleaning and every work day I add in how many minutes I worked that day, usually my calorie intake goes up to about 2000 (which I usually don’t hit but I do try to hit as many macronutrients as possible excluding sugar, sodium etc). On weekends my goal is 1200 and I just feel so hungry all day, even after eating a breakfast that’s high in protein. I don’t know if it’s because I’m used to eating so much throughout the week or if 1200 calories just isn’t enough.

Canola oil linked to worsened memory and learning ability in Alzheimer's,"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-12-canola-oil-linked-worsened-memory.html

&gt;Canola oil is one of the most widely consumed vegetable oils in the world, yet surprisingly little is known about its effects on health. Now, a new study published online December 7 in the journal Scientific Reports by researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) associates the consumption of canola oil in the diet with worsened memory, worsened learning ability and weight gain in mice which model Alzheimer's disease. The study is the first to suggest that canola oil is more harmful than healthful for the brain.

&gt;""Canola oil is appealing because it is less expensive than other vegetable oils, and it is advertised as being healthy,"" explained Domenico Praticò, MD, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at LKSOM, as well as senior investigator on the study. ""Very few studies, however, have examined that claim, especially in terms of the brain.""

&gt;Curious about how canola oil affects brain function, Dr. Praticò and Elisabetta Lauretti, a graduate student in Dr. Pratico's laboratory at LKSOM and co-author on the new study, focused their work on memory impairment and the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau, which is responsible for the formation of tau neurofibrillary tangles, contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease. The animal model was designed to recapitulate Alzheimer's in humans, progressing from an asymptomatic phase in early life to full-blown disease in aged animals.

&gt;Dr. Praticò and Lauretti had previously used the same mouse model in an investigation of olive oil, the results of which were published earlier in 2017. In that study, they found that Alzheimer mice fed a diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil had reduced levels of amyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau and experienced memory improvement. For their latest work, they wanted to determine whether canola oil is similarly beneficial for the brain.

&gt;The researchers started by dividing the mice into two groups at six months of age, before the animals developed signs of Alzheimer's disease. One group was fed a normal diet, while the other was fed a diet supplemented with the equivalent of about two tablespoons of canola oil daily.

&gt;The researchers then assessed the animals at 12 months. One of the first differences observed was in body weight - animals on the canola oil-enriched diet weighed significantly more than mice on the regular diet. Maze tests to assess working memory, short-term memory, and learning ability uncovered additional differences. Most significantly, mice that had consumed canola oil over a period of six months suffered impairments in working memory.

&gt;Examination of brain tissue from the two groups of mice revealed that canola oil-treated animals had greatly reduced levels of amyloid beta 1-40. Amyloid beta 1-40 is the more soluble form of the amyloid beta proteins. It generally is considered to serve a beneficial role in the brain and acts as a buffer for the more harmful insoluble form, amyloid beta 1-42.

&gt;As a result of decreased amyloid beta 1-40, animals on the canola oil diet further showed increased formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, with neurons engulfed in amyloid beta 1-42. The damage was accompanied by a significant decrease in the number of contacts between neurons, indicative of extensive synapse injury. Synapses, the areas where neurons come into contact with one another, play a central role in memory formation and retrieval.

&gt;""Amyloid beta 1-40 neutralizes the actions of amyloid 1-42, which means that a decrease in 1-40, like the one observed in our study, leaves 1-42 unchecked,"" Dr. Praticò explained. ""In our model, this change in ratio resulted in considerable neuronal damage, decreased neural contacts, and memory impairment.""

&gt;The findings suggest that long-term consumption of canola oil is not beneficial to brain health. ""Even though canola oil is a vegetable oil, we need to be careful before we say that it is healthy,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""Based on the evidence from this study, canola oil should not be thought of as being equivalent to oils with proven health benefits.""

&gt;The next step is to carry out a study of shorter duration to determine the minimum extent of exposure necessary to produce observable changes in the ratio of amyloid beta 1-42 to 1-40 in the brain and alter synapse connections. A longer study may be warranted in order to determine whether canola oil also eventually impacts tau phosphorylation, since no effects on tau were observed over the six-month exposure period.

&gt;""We also want to know whether the negative effects of canola oil are specific for Alzheimer's disease,"" Dr. Praticò added.

The reason why it's bad, is that it includes 30 grams of sugar, sugar alternatives &amp; high calories. But none of them explain how they drew this conclusion.  
  
I'm left confused. I'm not a nutritionist or that concerned with my eating habits, but when I look at the back of this Bottle, it Clearly states ""Carbohydrates, of which sugars: 0%"". So how can sugar be in the product that is labelled without sugar? In addition, I can see the energy reads ""35kJ/8kcal"". Does that mean the company is disregarding the NLEA 1990?  
  
The ingredients, in case something is obvious to you, consist of Erythritol, citrict acid, Vitamin C/D, acacia gum, glycerol esters of wood rosins, steviol glycosides &amp; carotenes.  
  
In my head, the sugar concerns (via corn syrup) were glucose/fructose, so beyond possible ""glycos-"", I don't know what's bad here. Can someone shine some light on my ignorance?",nutrition,1519218348,Jalkey,14,1,True,2018-02-21
How many of you who are lifting and (clean) bulking actually get less than 300 mg of cholesterol a day?,"I'm trying to do a clean bulk, and that means eating a lot of nutrient-dense foods.

With regard to animal products, it almost seems like there is a positive correlation with general nutrient density and cholesterol presence.  

I'm not trying to start up another cholesterol debate here, but would just like if people answered the question posed. I eat plenty of veggies with every meal, and I'm not on keto/paleo/etc, so I eat normal carbs like rice and pasta also. ",nutrition,1519223679,vrijheid1,15,0,True,2018-02-21

I wanna have a discussion about complex carbs vs simple carbs vs sugar,"In your opinion, how much better are simple carbs (white pasta or bread) than sugar (chocolate)? Do you entirely restrict added sugars or allow a bit? If you restrict added sugars how strict are you on the simple carbs? Personally I have struggled with binging on sugar for example I quit sugar for a while and then I try one chocolate chip cookie (one of my absolute favorites) and I literally end up eating 2-4 more. Because of this I try to entirely reduce added sugar although I eat in a college dining hall daily so it's difficult. The healthy options are few and far between so I often have white bread with salami and provolone cheese and some chipotle mayo. I know there may be sugar in the chipotle mayo and salami is a processed meat and white bread isn't as good as whole wheat bread but they don't have whole wheat baguettes so white it is. I think next year when I'm cooking for myself instead of eating in the dining hall I will try to increase veggies, substitute most of the simple carbs with more complex carbs (sweet potatoes over regular, brown rice over white, whole wheat bread over white, lots of quinoa, etc) and try to eliminate refined sugars except for occasional treats maybe once a week.

I am a 6ft3 29yo man weighing 80kg and looking for a simple meal plan with most complete nutrition possible from foods. My goal is to gain lean mass gradually, I workout 4 times per week currently.

I am not bothered about eating the same meals every day or eating the same meals all day and swapping weekly etc, food is fuel not entertainment for me.

• 6 cups roasted sweet potato
• 4 cups boiled spinach
• 2 oz roasted pumpkin seeds
• 1 Brazil nut
• Vitamin B13 supplement
• Vitamin D supplement 

But it does seem to have enough protein compared to other diets, although I have read that many people have far too much protein than needed. It also comes in at under 2000 caps and I need over 2500 to even maintain weight.

Anyone else hate how subject nutrition is?,"I've been a big advocate of healthy eating ever since a drastic food poisoning event in my life, and throughtout all of it, there has never been a bigger joke to me than the world of nutrition. There are so many different opinions, so many different statistics, that it's actually really frustrating to see people with such a solid opinion on what's """"""""healthy"""""""" and what's not """"""""healthy"""""""". What does that word even mean? Does healthy food prevent cancer? Does healthy food make you feel better? Does healthy food lengthen your life?

Not to mention the astronomical amount of contradictions there seems to be out there online, is overwhelming. No wonder people struggle to eat well.

Sugar is bad for you. But fruit isn't. Or is it? It's not if it's raw. But is it high alkaline? Then you should avoid it. But even then it's been growth with x amount of pesticides so it's unhealthy. But then again sugar is bad for you and so is fructose, so you should avoid fruit. But fruit is also what humans naturally collected so surely it can't be that bad? Oh but our bodies have changed over 1000 years. Honey is actually good for you, but it actually isn't, because it's pretty much just sugar. But studies have shown the benefits of it. But then again sugar is bad for you in any form.

Grains are bad for you. Except whole grains. Actually wait, white rice is highly digestible and doesn't contain anti-nutrients. Okay fine, brown rice is good for you. But wait, it's harder to digest. Okay fine I'll just avoid rice all together. But grains are bad for you. Okay fine.

Milk is bad for you, because we don't need saturated fat. But wait, don't people praise the Mediterranean diet that has various cheeses associated with it? But hey milk is bad. Well not all milk is bad, nut milks are good for you. Well actually not really, there's estrogen in soy milk. But isn't soy used a lot in Japanese cuisine, which is also praised as the healthiest? 

Meat is bad for you, yet in Japanese cuisine they eat fish all the time. Beans are a healthy alternative to meat, yet in the Mediterranean and Japanese diets it's almost non-existent. So is meat good for you, but only fish? Or is no meat good for you, replaced with beans, even though they aren't included in specific countries where the morality rate is higher? Does meat really cause cancer? Will veganism make you live longer?

There are so many inconsistencies, subjective opinions in nutrition, that it makes my mind boggle. Do we trust food based on statistics, or based on culture with high mortality rates? If we try to do both, we come up with extreme inconsistencies.

What is the primary energy source for the human body?,"There are two fuels the human body runs on, fat or glucose. I am not an expert but I would like to question the assumption that the body primarily runs on glucose. In nature we have been conditioned to two modes of existence: feast or famine. In Spring and Fall, the feast came in the form of fruits, vegetables, honey, nuts and tubers (roots). This was primarily sugars, grains and starches... basically carbs which convert into glucose. This triggers fat-storing hormones so that we could either fatten up for mating and child bearing or gain weight for the hardships of winter. In Winter or Summer out bodies release fat burning hormones so that we could live off our fat stores to get us through times of famine. Fat is a fuel that is available all year around. Carbs are only available twice a year.
     This brings us to the next point. Our muscles store glucose for “fight or flight”. It is always there to be easily ready for any emergency. A quick burst of energy in case we need to run from a predator or other immediate danger. It is replenished from our fat stores if depleted. It is a short term solution not meant to be prolonged. It seems to be secondary.
     How the body processes both fuels is another clue. I like to compare fats and carbs to jet fuel or diesel. Carbs are converted into glucose for a high energy, fast burn very much like jet fuel. If too much glucose (sugar) is in the blood stream, insulin spikes and signals cells to store it so that excess sugar is not floating around to do damage to our system. If the cells have reached their limits consistently, insulin resistance develops which leads to diabetes. The human body has not evolved to counteract this abundance because it is not a common occurrence. There was no need for a safety measure to evolve for this problem. Fat is a fuel that is like diesel fuel... slow and steady. It burns evenly with very little toxins leftover in the bloodstream. It stores easier and can be converted into glucose when needed. When the body has too much fat floating around, the body turns the hunger signals off and it is processed with little side effects. 
     The brain is wired for fat, salt and sugar. But only carbs have an addictive response in the human body. Why? When people eat food with plenty of fat, the body turns off the hunger signals and the body is satiated for long periods of time. Carbs are empty fuel with little benefit if not used immediately. People who eat carb heavy diets are constantly hungry and subject to blood sugar levels and insulin spikes. Why is this considered “normal”?
     Sugars, grains and starches all break down into glucose. There are no essential carbs for the body. There are essential fats, essential vitamins and minerals and protein is needed for our survival. Why would the body base a fuel on something that isn’t essential?
     We can live without simple carbs. It would seem that glucose is a short-term secondary fuel in every instance. Fat seems to be the primary fuel to me. Can someone explain the arguments for glucose being a better or primary fuel for the body?

Is It 'Worth it' To Eat Healthy?,"Please forgive my very, very stupid question.  I'm a reasonably fit, middle aged guy.  I've followed various diets and I've ranged from 'chubby' to 'rippling abs'; largely as a direct result of what I eat.

Through all of my dietary changes though, I've never 'felt' better.  The only changes I've been able to see or feel is having more or less bodyfat and more or less strength when lifting weights.

When I Google the benefits of nutrition I typically see things like:

* Heart health (risk of heart disease, blood pressure and cholesterol) 
* Type 2 diabetes
* Strong bones and teeth
* Weight control

And then, yes, if you include random people's blogs then the right organic vegetable will cure cancer.  But I'm ignoring that.  Of the things that the medical community seem to agree on....I'm left wondering if it's worth my time?

Weight (which affects type 2 diabetes, heart health and weight control) can be objectively measured and maintained regardless of your diet. Blood pressure and cholesterol can be objectively measured.  If I'm already at a healthy weight level, have good blood pressure and great cholesterol levels....is there any objective benefit I can expect from swapping out my diet?

If I'm not a competitive athlete or a growing child and I'm in otherwise good health as measured by whatever objective tests doctors have and I'm exercising but don't desire to have as little body fat as possible.....does it make sense for me to adopt a diet that I don't enjoy/takes more time/potentially costs more money when compared to my current pile of cheap, easily prepared, pre-processed, over-salted junk?

EDIT:

Thank you everyone who responded.  I want to apologize because I think my question is unclear.  I don't doubt that eating healthier is better; but I am trying to put objective numbers to it so that I can decide if it makes sense, based on my own risk tolerances.

IE - 'If you are at a healthy body composition, exercise regularly and eat junk good there is a X% chance of developing a non-trivial health condition before you die.  However, if you eat this particular healthy diet, that chance drops from X% to Y%'

Or some other easy to understand metric.  Maybe it's life expectancy (I tried but I couldn't find anything for life expectancy that was based on healthy/unhealthy food instead of obese/not obese - also some studies suggested obese people actually live longer...?).  If someone said to me, statistically speaking based on this study by the CDC or WHO, if you eat this healthy diet and exercise your life expectancy is 82.  But if you eat a crappy diet and exercise it is 41.....I'd never eat junk food again.  However, if the same study showed that the unhealthy diet reduces my life expectancy from 82 to 79....I might decide to stick with my junk food diet.

Obviously, everyone has their own preferences.  Just like some people choose to smoke or run marathons (both of those things come with negative health consequences)....but I'm trying to understand the benefits in a way that makes sense to me.  Right now, it's just this abstract concept of 'IT IS BETTER'.  I accept that, I'm not trying to convince anyone to not eat healthy food, I'm just trying to understand *how much better*.

P.S.  There were some book recommendations that I'll be trying to pick up, but I haven't had a chance just yet.  Maybe they have all the answers I'm looking for.  If so I'll be sure to update.",nutrition,1519477712,VisaEchoed,144,58,True,2018-02-24
How much EPA or DHA to expect from 10g of flax seeds?,"I've read before that flax seeds contain ALA, which then is converted to 5-15% EPA (I think?) and not sure if it converts to any DHA.

That's kind of what typical fish oil supplements have in one pill, which doesn't seem too bad for a table spoon of flax seeds, which also gives you 40mg of Magnesium, 3g of fiber, and a few other nutrients, with almost zero carbs.

A healthy diet. With some conditions/guidelines.,"Ok, before you jump in with ""this has been asked before"", I know it's been asked before but I'd like to guide it in a more helpful way for more people and for it to be easier to apply to our daily nutrition. I am also unsure if this is on the most appropriate sub. But read on before judging. But I'm trying to create a valuable resource regarding the ""healthiest diet"", which I appreciate has no absolute answer. 

Firstly, some caveats. I am not looking to take this to an extreme level. The general view I'm trying to take with this is ""I would like to eat healthy food which gives me healthy energy, ensures my brain, body and muscles function well and I am avoiding toxic or processed foods or excessive amounts of anything"". Basically, try and keep my insides clean, healthy and optimal. 

I have trawled most threads on this and the general idea is a balanced diet, quality whole foods and majority plant based. Whilst I appreciate this, as a novice, I am unsure how to develop this. Maybe it would be good to gather some example foods/meals, some guidelines on what/how many nutrients to take in and the benefits these foods and nutrients have? I think there is a lack of resources of tips people can use to begin buying the right foods from the right places and start introducing it into our daily lives. I also think people appreciate the basic science behind suggestions. Basically ELI5. 

Fire away. I'd like this to develop into a useful resource for people who are wanting to eat healthy or already eat a relatively balanced diet, understand the basics, but don't really know where to take it from there. ",nutrition,1519573557,thehulkxx,13,6,True,2018-02-25

How accurate is cronometer?,"I'm trying to work out the nutritional value of 500g dry, uncooked, plain, white, unenriched pasta made from 100% durum wheat semolina. 

Chronometer is telling me that 500g would give me a few B vitamins which I expected, but also quite significant amounts of copper and other minerals.

what I added: https://imgur.com/YNaCHNP


the results: https://imgur.com/OCI3Yx4


Is this accurate? I considered white pasta to be basically nutritionally void - even in large quantities.

Are there any scientifically proven short-term ways to loss fat (that don't involve starvation or surgery) ?,"If this question belongs to https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/80cvkq/rnutrition_diet_evaluation_requests_february_26/ please tell me and I shall move it, but I felt like it's not quite fitting there.

Over the last 3 years my BMI has oscillated between the values of 20 and 30 (with it currently being at 24.5).

Which means I've gone from the ""thin"" spectrum of normal weight to the ""quite fat but not quite obese"" spectrum of overweight, which is a visible thing when looking at my body.

However, even when I was at my thinnest (probably bellow 20, but at the time I wasn't weighting myself) I still had fat on my body. You could literally see my ribs but I still had a bit of a belly and huge thighs (for a young man, at any rate)

I've previously managed to loss weight best via cardio + calories deficits and I'm thinking about doing the same this spring, to hopefully reach a BMI of around 18 to 20. 

However I'm wondering if there's any way to loss weight and get rid of fat ? (rather than some fat and a lot of muscle mass) that doesn't involve anything extreme (e.g. daily exercise, starvation to ""reset"" the body or liposuction). I've heard of many ""fad"" diets that claim this and even tried a low carbohydrates diet for over a month (with little success).

Looking at most scientific evidence it seems that humans that had an unhealthy diet as kids generate too much insulin, meaning carbohydrates will be stored as fat rather than used, resulting in lower energy levels after a meal (resulting in you wanting to eat more) and more easily storing fat (even when eating at a calories deficit and losing muscle).

As far as I've seen the only ""proven"" way to change this patterns is:

a) Stay on a healthy diet for dozens of years

b) Fucks with your diet in extreme ways as to not consume any carbohydrates (which is mentally hard, expensive, antiscoial, unpleasant, possibly dangerous for the kidneys and has very few ""results"" from normal people, it seems that mostly gym freaks and diabetics are benefiting from this diet)

c) Stress your body to an unusual extent (e.g. by doing heavy lifting and intense cardio each day for a few hours or by starving yourself for days on end)


What I've considered doing myself too make the process faster and less unpleasant, is:

a) Stay on a diet consisting of a calories deficit and take an insulin inhibitor (e.g. Leptin) and a beta-hydroxybutyrate supplement in order to externally force my body to use fat and not store fat. This seems unpleasant but also fast and bearable (reducing my meals to 1 meal a day doesn't seem that bad for a few weeks). However it also seems quite dangerous and tedious, since I would have to test my blood glucose every few hours and have an insulin injection at the ready unless I want to risk death. It also seems like any changes afterwards might be easily reverted once I'm off the supplements, it even seems like it could make matters worst (by making my body produce more insuline)

b) Buy the necessary testing equipment and nutritional supplements to fully starve myself (except for eating fiber as to not completely ruin my gut flora) for a few weeks whilst trying not to damage my body (would obviously result in some muscle loss but hopefully eating nothing would mean my body is forced to start using up fat). I've also starved myself for ~80 hours (albite accidentally) and at the end of the period I hadn't suffered any noticeable damage, despite the fact I didn't use any nutritional supplements and I was consuming an unhealthy level of stimulants, so I'm a bit more confident I could mentally and physically do this.

c) Have my fat surplus removed surgically. Which seems to be by far the fastest and least hard method, but also involves some amount of risks due to surgery and would put me down a few thousands. It's also hard to find a surgery that's well designed for eliminating ""a little"" fat, most of them seem to be intended for obese people.

Or I could do nothing... but at this point the fat is annoying me, it's a physical hazard for me since I've got hereditary bone problems (which are made worst by it dragging on my hips). 

So my question for you guys is... are there any scientifically proven ways for a normal person (European/US normal, as in, organism releases insulin too liberally) to loss body fat within a short amount of time (let's say bellow 12 months) and, if not, wich of the methods I listed above you you consider to be the safest ?

Substituting my breakfast meal with a mass gainer.,"Don't know if this is the correct sub.
But.
Are there any health risks doing so? I don't usually eat breakfast at all during work days and I'm looking to gain some extra weight. I've also been getting fatigued and suffering muscular soreness throughout the day and thought perhaps I'm not getting enough energy. I work as a barista and start very early, never give myself enough time to have breakfast and don't usually get a break until 2pm. Most work days I'll only eat one meal and maybe a few light snacks.

Red meats: Time for a paradigm shift in dietary advice,"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174014001922

**Red meats: Time for a paradigm shift in dietary advice
Highlights**

&gt;- Dietary advice to limit red meat is unnecessarily restrictive and may have unintended health consequences.
- Overzealous focus on limiting red meat may have distracted from effective nutrition strategies to address chronic diseases.
- With increasing intakes of highly processed foods it is important to reconsider nutrition priorities.

&gt;Abstract

&gt;Recent evidence suggests dietary advice to limit red meat is unnecessarily restrictive and may have unintended health consequences. As nutrient-rich high quality protein foods, red meats can play an important role in helping people meet their essential nutrient needs. Yet dietary advice to limit red meat remains standard in many developed countries, even though red meat intakes appear to be within current guidelines. Meanwhile, energy intakes from processed foods have increased dramatically at the expense of nutrient-rich foods, such as red meat. Research suggests these food trends are associated with the growing burden of obesity and associated diseases in recent decades. It is time for dietary advice that emphasizes the value of unprocessed red meat as part of a healthy balanced diet.",nutrition,1519890311,1345834,28,5,True,2018-03-01

Are vegetables necessary?,"I came across this video by Christopher Walker, and wanted to know what this sub thinks of the information laid out in this video :

#https://youtu.be/KtgyJ--X61g

______
Video Summary:

What is A Vegetable? 

The working definition of what constitutes a vegetable has actually been strangely controversial. However, for the purposes of this video I am going to define the plants that we’ll be discussing: fruits, vegetables, and tubers - in the following, most widely agreed-upon way: 

A vegetable constitutes the stems and leaves, for example celery and broccoli (stems) and kale, spinach, lettuce (leaves)
A fruit contains seeds (or can act as a seed), and is the structure that develops from the ovaries of a flowering plant: for example, apples, peaches, grapes etc. (all the common ones). One common misconception is that fruits are only sweet. There are actually plenty of savory fruits, for example eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, avocados, olives, squash, and bell peppers. 
Tubers are roots. They’re so dense in nutrients that they literally sprout and sustain their own plants if left unharvested. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, turnips, and beets all fall under this category. 

As you can see, most of what the average person would consider a vegetable, is actually NOT a vegetable. And all of the ones that most people would actually agree tasted any good, are not vegetables… they are fruits and tubers. I’ll go more into why I think this is the case, here in a minute. 


The Symbiotic Relationship Between Fruits and Humans

One thing that struck me as interesting is to just take a step back and simply examine the facts about the differences between how fruits, vegetables, and tubers grow. And what this might tell us about their specific value or purpose in their evolutionary role with humans. 

It would appear after a basic examination of the facts, that fruits are meant to be eaten. Here’s what I mean by that. First off, they’re jam packed with nutrients, and if someone was to eat even a small range of different fruits regularly, they would fulfill most if not all of their dietary micronutrient needs. Another thing that is interesting is the fast ripening cycles of fruits. They go through fast growing and ripening cycles, and all contain seeds (most of the seeds/pits are hard and inedible) that regrow the trees/bushes/vines after consumption, even if the human/animal just drops it on the ground haphazardly. This is a really convincing and genius pollination technique that ensures their long term survival but also their relationship with animals/people that will eat them and spread their seed for them after. 

Vegetables on the other hand are not this way, they require more careful cultivation and release small amounts of bitter toxins as a defense mechanism against being eaten by animals/insects... quite the opposite of fruits. Vegetables have developed these defense systems specifically to NOT be eaten by insects or other animals. While the leaves and stems of certain plants do contain nutrients, they’re not necessarily the best sources of those nutrients for humans to consume. They contain almost zero calories, which evolutionarily speaking is a downside, and the human stomach doesn’t have much of a capacity for massive leaf or stem consumption due to the high load of fiber, whereas other species of mammals have developed stomach systems, like that of grazing cows, that are meant to be able to handle massive all-day-long consumption of these grasses, stems, and leaves. 

It simply does not make any evolutionary sense for a human to NEED to consume the leaves or stems of certain plants in order to be healthy. The low caloric density coupled with high fiber and non-exclusive nutrients all point to a reasonable conclusion that humans do not need to consume vegetables - they are likely, in fact, more of a luxury in today’s modern world, but most definitely not necessary.

Now let’s consider tubers. Tubers are literally roots that are so nutritious they will sprout their own plants, and feed those plants with their nutrients. They also gather nutrients from the soil around them. Hell, you don’t even have to plant a tuber in the ground for it to grow… if you leave a potato out on the kitchen counter, for example, it will sprout without water or outside nutrition. Tubers also have a generally very appealing taste to humans and other animals. The starchy carbohydrates are easily digested and also contain prebiotic fiber which is great for human intestinal flora.

Tryptophan to Serotonin conversion.,"Hello, new to nutrition.

I was hoping to boost serotonin levels so am assuming:
 
1) Eat foods high in Tryptophan

2) The Tryptophan converts to Serotonin in the gut.

different oil misinformation,"Saturated fats are actually good for you and the studies of them being bad are wrong. Vegetable oil causes inflammation especially when high heated and they are now finding that the cause of lung cancer in Asian countries of women is blamed on deep frying and stir frying with vegetable oils. Even though Vegetable oils have a high smoking point recent research shows they cause lots of bad chemicals when heated.  In fact heart disease has gone worse even though all these industries have blamed saturated fats. But in the past if you research many people cooked with animal fats and were completely healthy. By nature saturated fats are made to be deep fried since saturated fats are made to handle high temperatures.    


       I am saying all of this so everyone can research the truth as to why a lot of inflammatory diseases are happening. Honestly the reason why I even sought this information is because when I introduced these healthy fats they really took out all my inflammation and helped me easy weight loss.

"Yes, bacon really is killing us. Decades’ worth of research proves that chemicals used to make bacon do cause cancer. So how did the meat industry convince us it was safe?","long read but fascinating if you find this stuff interesting 
              
https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/bacon-cancer-processed-meats-nitrates-nitrites-sausages

And yet the evidence linking bacon to cancer is stronger than ever. In January, **a new large-scale study using data from 262,195 British women suggested that consuming just 9g of bacon a day – less than a rasher – could significantly raise the risk of developing breast cancer later in life. The study’s lead author, Jill Pell from the Institute of Health and Wellbei**ng at Glasgow University, told me that while it can be counterproductive to push for total abstinence, the scientific evidence suggests “it would be misleading” for health authorities to set any safe dose for processed meat “other than zero”.

The real scandal of bacon, however, is that it didn’t have to be anything like so damaging to our health. **The part of the story we haven’t been told – including by the WHO – is that there were always other ways to manufacture these products that would make them significantly less carcinogenic**. The fact that this is so little known is tribute to the power of the meat industry, which has for the past 40 years been engaged in a campaign of cover-ups and misdirection to rival the dirty tricks of Big Tobacco.

snip

“Pure insane crazy madness” is how Coudray described the continuing use of nitrates and nitrites in processed meats, in an email to me. The madness, in his view, is that it is possible to make bacon and ham in ways that would be less carcinogenic. The most basic way to cure any meat is to salt it – either with a dry salt rub or a wet brine – and to wait for time to do the rest. Coudray notes that ham and bacon manufacturers claim this old-fashioned way of curing isn’t safe. But the real reason they reject it is cost: it takes much longer for processed meats to develop their flavour this way, which cuts into profits.

snip

But something different happens when nitrates are used in meat processing. **When nitrates interact with certain components in red meat (haem iron, amines and amides), they form N-nitroso compounds, which cause cancer. The best known of these compounds is nitrosamine. This, as Guillaume Coudray explained to me in an email, is known to be “carcinogenic even at a very low dose”** . Any time someone eats bacon, ham or other processed meat, their gut receives a dose of nitrosamines, which damage the cells in the lining of the bowel, and can lead to cancer.",nutrition,1520047692,Bluest_waters,91,339,True,2018-03-02

Does a high carb intake contribute to NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) or just high fructose intake?,"I've read numerous articles (sorry no links unfortunately) that suggest that a high carb/fructose intake increases triglycerides and contributes to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). I've also read that a low carb/high fat (keto) diet can improve NAFLD.

I've also read that fructose is the culprit rather than a high carb intake in general.

So what is your view on it? Does a high carb intake contribute to it or just purely fructose? 

Would someone eating at a caloric deficit with a high carb and/or high fructose intake still be at risk of any issues?

Is it impossible to improve or reverse NAFLD with a high carb or high fructose diet?

Is a low carb/ketogenic diet the only way to improve or reduce NAFLD?

"On a purely nutritional basis, ethics aside, is there any reason not to eat good quality, low fat meat?","A lot of people on this sub are advocates of a whole food plant based (WFPB) diet - not just for ethical reasons but many follow this way of eating purely for the nutritional benefits.

There are also lots of 'experts' who advocate WFPB as the healthiest way of eating. People like Dr Michael Gregor who have gone to great lengths producing videos explaining why WFPB is beneficial compared to a diet which includes animal products.

A lot of their arguments in terms of health are things like meat can have high levels of inflammatory omega 6 with a poor ratio of 3:6. Some still maintain that the saturated fat content of meat is a negative too.

However...

Let's say I was consuming a piece of organic, grass fed free range skinless, boneless chicken breast with a good 3:6 ratio (certainly nothing to be concerned about). Fat content would be very low, so the saturated fat argument can't be used. Completely whole, not processed, just a roast chicken breast from a whole chicken.

Ethics/animal welfare issues aside, **is there any nutritional reason why a good quality piece of meat like this is going to be of any harm to me in addition to consuming whole foods/plants?**

In other words, taking a purely nutritional viewpoint, why would meat such as this with a good 3:6 profile be any worse than eating plants? 

Thanks.

FYI - this isn't a discussion about the benefits or negatives of saturated fat, I only used that example as it is one often cited by those advocating lower fat and/or WFPB foods.",nutrition,1520211090,bachus2015,29,6,True,2018-03-04

Meat never makes me full. Anyone is the same?,"So I have been googling it in every language I know, and every time I put ""meat"" and ""full"" together I get questions of those who can't get full UNLESS they eat meat.
Now, this phenomenon has always baffled me, as I have been this way since I was a child.
Basically, if I have a yoghurt and a banana that keeps me full for 4-5 hours and I instantly feel full.
If I have sautéed spinach (just by itself, no cream, nothing else) and maybe some fresh vegetables - same story. A piece of bread - I'm full.
However no matter how much meat I eat I can't get full - bloated - yes, if I eat like a kilo (it has been done), but still feel hunger that never goes away. If anything, I feel this burning feeling of hunger even more after having had meat. I salivate like crazy, and even when I was a child I'd eat like 500 grams of meatballs and then still would need at least a tiny spoon of rice to feel better. But most common craving after meat is sweets - I can't stop thinking about them even though I never get food cravings.
That said, I can get full after having a bit of processed meat - like some ham etc.

Major cause of dementia discovered. The build-up of urea in the brain to toxic levels can cause brain damage – and eventually dementia.,"https://knowridge.com/2018/03/major-cause-of-dementia-discovered/

An international team of scientists have confirmed the discovery of a major cause of dementia, with important implications for possible treatment and diagnosis.

Professor Garth Cooper from The University of Manchester, who leads the Manchester team, says the build-up of urea in the brain to toxic levels can cause brain damage – and eventually dementia.

The work follows on from Professor Cooper’s earlier studies, which identified metabolic linkages between Huntington’s, other neurodegenerative diseases and type-2 diabetes.

The team consists of scientists from The University of Manchester, the University of Auckland, AgResearch New Zealand, the South Australian Research and Development Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University.

The latest paper by the scientists, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that Huntington’s Disease – one of seven major types of age-related dementia – is directly linked to brain urea levels and metabolic processes.

Their 2016 study revealing that urea is similarly linked to Alzheimer’s, shows, according to Professor Cooper, that the discovery could be relevant to all types of age-related dementias.",nutrition,1520387554,Bluest_waters,112,262,True,2018-03-06

"If you consume vegetable oil, does your body instantly become inflamed as the oil travels through your body?","How does inflammation work when it comes to vegetable oil (unhealthy oils - not talking about olive oil, avocado oil, etc.)?

Does optimal nutrition strongly affect cancer probabilities?,"For example, let's say someone has a 1% chance of getting a specific type of cancer in their lifetime due to their genes. By consuming food with poor nutrition, mostly industrial food, will this percentage be strongly affected?

And, by consuming optimal food with great nutritional profiles, will the percentage get lower?

I couldn't find specific studies on that subject.",nutrition,1520441763,FatherofVader,7,2,True,2018-03-07

Silly question about fibre,"Okay so a buddy of mine were having a silly argument about fibre that got me curious.

&amp;nbsp;

Is it critical to survival? Can you live without it? I'm comparing it to things like; protein, carbs, salt, fat, cholesterol which I'm fairly sure you can't live without. 

&amp;nbsp;


I know it's healthier to have it, it aids in digestion, water absorption by the intestines, makes stools bind together, helps move stool through the bowels etc. It's part of a healthy diet for sure. 

&amp;nbsp;

But is it critical the way the other nutrients I listed are? I realize this a silly question, and not very practical because in order to cut out fibre completely you'd have to cut out most; fruits, veggies, grains etc which can be vital. 

But hypothetically? ",nutrition,1520454251,brennanww,28,7,True,2018-03-07
