Here’s What You Should Really be Eating Before &amp; After a Workout (it may not be what you think),"If you find yourself confused about what and when you should be eating both before and after a workout, you definitely aren’t alone. So many of us wonder what in the world we are actually supposed to be eating. Between all the confusing info out there, it can make it hard to determine if you should be having that protein shake before after that cardio sesh. 

If you want in on knowing what works best for pre-workout fuel, and which foods work best after your workout, read on. 

*Processing img y9oq243ni1531...*

**What to Eat Before Exercise** 

*Processing img 2lt0lpayi1531...*

**Carbs:** Most athletes and fitness enthusiasts know just how important carbs are for energy during our workouts, so much so that some athletes will choose to carb load before a big event. However, for the average gym-goer, large amounts of carbs prior to a workout isn’t really necessary, which leads to the question of what should you be eating, and when? To help fuel your muscles with glucose to support energy levels during your next cardio or strength training workout, you will want to add some carbs to your meal 2-3 hours before your workout. Things like sweet potatoes, brown rice, rolled oats, quinoa, and fruit are all excellent options. 

**Protein:** While [protein](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eat-before-workout#section2) is often thought to serve as a post-workout fuel source, adding some protein to your pre-workout meal may also rev up your workout a little. By adding some clean protein sources to your diet before you hit play on your next [FitOn](https://fitonapp.com/) workout, you can help support muscle recovery, increase strength, and muscle performance (sweet deal!) And, studies have found that enjoying some good old [whey protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16896166) before a workout was especially beneficial. So go ahead and add a scoop of whey protein to your pre-workout smoothie, or sprinkle some in your cup of unsweetened almond or coconut milk yogurt. Just be sure to stick to 100% grass fed whey protein to stay away from those yucky hormones and additives. 

**Fat:** Adding some fat to your pre-workout meal can help supercharge your energy levels by providing you with some longer lasting energy as opposed to just fueling up with carbs. Fat will help prolong those energy levels, and may even help you push yourself just a little bit longer each time you workout. The important thing here is to stay away from damaged fats. Anything that says trans, hydrogenated, or partially hydrogenated on the nutrition label should be avoided- in fact, run, don’t walk away from these products. Choose healthy fats like avocados, coconut oil, nuts, seeds, and whole eggs instead. 

**Pre-Workout Food Choices** 

Hungry yet? After all that talk about food, we want to share some healthy options you can snack on before working out. And, keep in mind that it’s best to enjoy a balanced meal or snack 2-3 hours before working out, if possible. If life gets in the way, don’t sweat it. You can enjoy an easily digestible snack about 45-60 minutes before you start exercising. We have shared some of our fav options below. 

* *Coconut milk yogurt with flax or chia seeds and raw honey* 
* *Blueberry banana smoothie with almond milk and collagen protein* 
* *Avocado Toast* 
* *Bowl of oatmeal with nut butter* 
* *Handful of nuts with a side of berries* 

&amp;#x200B;

**What to Eat After Exercise** 

*Processing img cplxsd84j1531...*

Ok, so you just had a sweat dripping awesome workout, and you are totally toast not to mention starving. But, what do you fuel up on? Is it best to enjoy a full meal, or should you blend up a quick protein shake? We’re here to break it all down for you. 

**A Balanced Meal is Key** 

Just like how you want to combine some sort of complex carbohydrates (you know, the slower releasing ones like oats and quinoa,) protein, and fat before your workout, you want to enjoy a balanced meal post-workout as well. Or, if you can’t get around to making a full meal, that’s totally ok too. You can blend up a balanced protein shake instead. 

Here’s why having a bit of each macronutrient is super important for post-workout recovery. 

**Carbs:** Eating some carbs after your workout is going to help replenish those glycogen stores that you just burned through during your workout. Your body dips into these stores to use as energy, but you can use them up pretty quickly, especially with regular exercise. So, do your body a favor and give these stores a much-needed boost with some healthy carbs from things like starchy veggies (sweet potatoes, beets, squash,) or things like brown rice, quinoa, oats, or carb-heavy fruits like bananas.

**Protein:** Getting some protein in after your workout is going to be key to building those muscles you’re working so hard to get. Refuel those tired muscles by getting [20-40 grams](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eat-after-workout#section2) of protein after your sweat sesh for optimal results. While it may sound like a ton of protein, you can easily pack in this much by adding a scoop of collagen or bone broth protein to your post-workout shake and add in a half a cup of unsweetened Greek yogurt for an added post-workout protein boost. 

**Fat:** Many people worry that having too much fat after a workout will hinder their body’s ability to absorb nutrients. But, fear not because healthy fats are not going to take away from all the benefits of the other nutritious foods you enjoy in your post-workout meal. So, go ahead and add a quarter of an avocado to your protein shake, or drizzle some coconut oil over your sweet potato. The healthy fats can help give you a much-needed energy boost while also boosting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. So, honestly, there's no need to fear healthy fats. 

**Post Workout Food Choices** 

When it comes to *what* to fuel your body with after an intense workout, we have you covered. We also want to mention *when* you should be eating after your workout. 

It’s best to chow down on that post-workout meal about 45ish minutes after your done working out. But, if it’s not right within that time, don’t panic, just try to get snacking asap. 

And, to help you figure out which foods to eat post-workout, we have listed some of our fav go-to post-workout food choices. 

* Rice pasta with ground turkey and broccoli 
* 2 rice cakes with almond butter and hemp seeds
* Protein shake with almond milk, banana, flax seeds, and collagen protein 
* 2 hard-boiled eggs with a side of fruit and a slice of gluten-free toast 

**The Bottom Line** 

Nutrition plays a huge role for both pre-workout fuel to give you the energy to dominate that workout, and post-workout fuel to help support muscle recovery, and to replenish those glycogen stores. The bottom line is that the better you eat, the better your workouts will be. So, don’t cheat yourself by skipping pre and post-workout meals, it could be just what you need to give your body the boost to power through those last five reps of each workout. With increased endurance comes faster and better results, so go on and get your pre and post-workout fuel on, your body is counting on it!

4 Ways to Enjoy Apple Cider Vinegar for Weight Loss: No Vinegar Shots Required,"Here’s how to get your daily dose of ACV in even if you’re not an ACV fan.

https://i.redd.it/9fztv5kr26531.jpg

Apple cider vinegar is one of those ancient remedies that your grandmother may have used as often as the Portokalo family used Windex in *My Big Fat Greek Wedding.* However, there’s some real truth, and some science, of course, to back many of the health claims, including its ability to help with stubborn fat loss.

However, we’re not just talking about any old apple cider vinegar, we’re talking about raw apple cider vinegar, the one that contains “The Mother.” The mother of vinegar refers to that cloudy sediment that sits at the bottom of a bottle of unfiltered and unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. While not the most appetizing looking, this is the good stuff! This health-promoting gold mine found in raw apple cider vinegar aka ACV is what’s responsible for many of the health benefits.

**Wondering How Apple Cider Vinegar Can Help With Weight Loss? Here’s How**

That cloudy sediment that sits at the bottom of a bottle of raw apple cider vinegar is acetic acid bacteria which is loaded with healthy probiotics and enzymes to support digestive health and weight loss.

***Heads up! Proper digestive health is a secret weapon for boosting weight loss success, a big reason why apple cider vinegar works so well for supporting fat loss.***

In fact, numerous [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5867888/) have looked at just how important supporting the gut microbiome is when it comes to successfully losing weight. Here’s one more reason to get your daily dose of apple cider vinegar for weight loss.

In addition to its ability to help boost healthy gut bacteria, and better digestion, here are some other ways enjoying raw ACV daily can help kick your weight loss success into high gear.

* Acetic acid found in apple cider vinegar has been [linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661687) to lower fat accumulation.
* Apple cider vinegar may be able to help prevent metabolic syndrome
* Apple cider vinegar has also been [linked ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19661687)to a reduction in triglyceride levels and body fat mass.

**4 Ways to Get Your Apple Cider Vinegar Fix For Weight Loss (we promise, no ACV shots required)**

Hit a Fitness Plateau? Here’s Why Nutrition May be the Missing Link to Better Results,"Real talk, proper nutrition is essential for overall health. What you eat plays a big part in energy levels, immune support, and the foods you eat fuel your workouts.

When it comes to nutrition, healthy women know it's not a matter of looking good; it's a matter of feeling good. When we seek out the foods and nutrients humans were *meant* to consume, i.e., protein, healthy carbs, and healthy fats, we'll set aside the sugar-rich, highly addictive snacks the food industry wants us to consume.

We’re spilling the deets on exactly why nutrition is super duper important and are breaking down exactly what kinds of foods you should be eating plus, how to replace the sugary and downright toxic food options that dominate the supermarket aisles.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Is Nutrition Important?**

So, what’s the deal with nutrition-why is it so important for fitness performance? The bottom line is that nutrient-rich foods will fuel your workout. Equate it to the gasoline we pour into our cars. And it's more than choosing the vegetable over the doughnut. It's about the right kinds of foods like choosing the right kind of carbs (complex vs. refined) and clean protein sources.

&amp;#x200B;

**Carbs**

Too many people rely on simple carbs to start their day (we’re looking at you bagels and toast.) If you replace these carb-heavy options with fiber and protein, you'll offer your body a kickstart. Plus, you’ll stay full until lunch leaving less room to snack on unhealthy snack options at the office.

But, let’s look at carbs a little closer because, let’s face it, carbs have a bad rap. Some diets push the idea that we should be avoiding them at all costs, but we don’t have to be so extreme in most cases. Here’s the thing-carbs can serve as an excellent fuel source for both our everyday energy and can supercharge our workouts. But, we must consume the right kind of carbs and leave the refined and sugary options behind.

[Simple carbs](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19534.htm) are loaded with sugar and cause an unhealthy spike in our glucose levels. Meanwhile, [complex carbs](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19529.htm) are slower to release and less likely to spike our blood sugar. Complex carbs are also more likely to give us longer more sustained energy throughout our workouts.

Some great options include.

* *Rolled oats*
* *Quinoa*
* *Brown rice*
* *High-Fiber Fruit (raspberries, pears, blueberries)*
* *Vegetables*
* *Beans*

&amp;#x200B;

**Protein**

Ever wondered why protein shakes are so popular in the workout world? Well, protein builds and repairs muscles. That means we're more likely to reap the benefits of a productive workout. Protein shakes are a great supplement after a rigorous workout, plus they are super easy to make for all of us ladies who live a busy lifestyle. The trick is to use a high-quality protein powder free from added sugar and artificial ingredients. Some great options include collagen protein, bone broth protein, or grass-fed whey (if dairy is well-tolerated.)

Also, if you're ever running low on carbs but your workout isn't over yet, protein will step in as an alternate fuel source.

Try adding plenty of clean protein sources to your diet by adding some protein to each meal from foods like:

* *Chicken*
* *Wild-caught fish*
* *Eggs*
* *Lentils*
* *Beans*
* *Quinoa*
* *Full-fat unsweetened Greek yogurt*

&amp;#x200B;

**Superfoods**

Burning 800 calories in a spin class only to consume two or three margaritas at night may not give you the results you are exactly looking for. It fills the body with empty calories that can't be used for anything beneficial, and it inhibits the [brain functionality](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110) that was just bolstered during a workout.

The same goes for highly processed foods. They pour nutrient-void elements into our bodies which brings us to the term ""superfood.""

Basically, these foods provide tremendous fuel for our bodies. They're low in sugar and high in vitamins. They provide us with healthy carbohydrates (the ones that don't douse our systems in sugar) and healthy fats. They're also super rich in antioxidants.

Common superfoods include:

* *Kale*
* *Turmeric*
* *Coconut*
* *Chia seeds*
* *Flax seeds*
* *Hemp seeds*
* *Berries*

&amp;#x200B;

**Antioxidants**

Speaking of antioxidants, antioxidants are great because they travel into our system and eradicate [free radicals](https://www.livescience.com/54901-free-radicals.html) which attack our healthy cells. As a result, they help us ward off illness and disease.

We can find antioxidants in:

* *Dark leafy greens*
* *Vegetables*
* *Berries*
* *Green tea*

While we're on the subject, it's worth noting a lesser-known antioxidant called quercetin. Quercetin is one of the [most potent antioxidants](https://draxe.com/quercetin/) in the game. Along with battling free radicals, it can also increase our metabolic rates. We find this superfood in apples, berries, broccoli, and onions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Metabolism Boosters**

Of course, regular exercise will keep our metabolism running at high levels. But, some of the food we eat can provide a little added boost. There are plenty of foods out there that stimulate the fat burning process.

Heavy hitters in this category include:

* *Green tea*
* *Black coffee*
* *Nuts and seeds*
* *Fatty fish (wild-caught salmon, sardines)*
* *Coconut oil*

And,  if you like adding a little bit of heat to your meals, then we’re all for adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to your stir-fry as spicy foods may also help give your metabolism the little kick it needs to rev into high gear.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bottom Line**

Healthy women around the globe know it's not about the hours we spend in Pilates class. It's about the food we eat. We can choose to fuel our bodies with healthy carbs and antioxidants or we can slow down our systems and spike our sugar levels to dangerous highs.

Healing Your Gallbladder Naturally through the powerful use of herbs &amp; supplements!," 

Let’s talk Gallbladder.

Not many of us think much about this powerful organ, nor do many of us even know of its primary function, which might be one of the reasons why gallbladder removal is one of the top surgeries performed in the USA today!

Digestive issues are one of the main culprits of gallbladder issues, but other warning signs and causes include obesity, eating a poor (nutrient dense) diet, rapid weight loss, food allergies and possibly genetic factors. Improving your gallbladder’s health can mean improving your lifestyle. By adding in nutrient rich foods, herbs and supplements, your gallbladder can gain the support it needs to function correctly! And ultimately, get you feeling better!

No gallbladder? No problem! In this video Stephanie will also go over ways to support your body back into optimal wellness without the help of your gallbladder.

Para mi, el **tiempo es oro**, y prefiero dedicarlo a mis hobbies y familia.

Quiero **hacer la vida más fácil a personas como tu**. Así nació **Universo Bienestar**.

Busco la información de los productos que evalúo y te muestro la información, las ventajas, las desventajas, los precios, y el lugar dónde comprarlos desde casa o el móvil, a golpe de click. Selecciono los mejores productos por tipo de categoría y te los muestro comparativamente. **Tu acabarás decidiendo en base a tus preferencias y necesidades**.

What are wellness related things that people are actually wanting help with?,"Hey all! I’m in the beginning stages of starting a wellness coaching business and would love to get and starting helping clients. The problem I’m having is that I’m not entirely sure what specific things people are actually wanting help with, which is making it difficult for me to market my services because I’m not sure what area or areas of wellness to highlight when I’m marketing/pitching my services.

For a little context, I define wellness as the balance and interaction between the body, mind, and emotions. Mindfulness and the core concepts of Ayurveda form the basic framework of how I approach wellness and coaching. I’m more than willing to work with anyone who wants to work with me, but I’m particularly interested in working with millennials, men in general, and queer men. (I’m all three of these things)

7-Day Clean Eating Challenge,"7-Day Clean Eating Challenge

For the next 7 days I challenge you to remove all dairy, sugar, alcohol, and processed foods from your diet. Instead of thinking of this as a difficult task that requires giving everything up, let’s look at it as a fun game of self-care. The only thing you’re giving up is inflammation and disease, while adding in self-love. Healthy eating is not a diet, and it certainly isn’t a fad, it’s a lifestyle.

I'm concerned whether this could be bugs or just static? Looking closely there appears to be no bugs but I know they can be very small sometimes. Also, laying the bag still on the counter will still result in a jumping chia seed after a bit even with no movement.

Summer is Coming - How Much water we Should drink and Why? [See Inside]," **Why Our Bodies Need Water?**

How much of the human body is water? It might surprise you to learn that water makes up about 60 percent of our body weight.And what does water do for the body? The benefits of drinking water are many: It’s vital for almost every function in the body. Water acts as a building block, a solvent for chemical reactions, and a transport material for nutrients and waste.

### Water Your Body: 6 Benefits

* **Improve physical performance.** During physical activity, our bodies use up a lot of water. So stay hydrated before, during, and after exercise helps to protect your body from harm, and to help you to perform better. Proper hydration can reduce fatigue, improve endurance, lower your maximum heart rate, and more. It can also help you to be less sore after exercise.
* **Help you to lose weight.** Are you having trouble with your weight loss efforts? Increasing your water intake may help you achieve better results. Studies show that people who are on diets lose more weight when they also increase their water intake. In one study, people on weight loss diets who drank 500 ml of water before each of their three daily meals for 12 weeks lost 4.6 more pounds on average than people who did not drink the additional water.
* **Boost your mood.** People who drink more water also tend to have better moods. One study found that when people who regularly drank less than 1.2 liters of water per day increased their intake to 2.5 liters per day, the participants experienced significantly less confusion, bewilderment, fatigue, and sleepiness. On the other hand, for people who regularly drank two to four liters of water per day who were then restricted to one liter per day, the reduced water intake led negative effects on mood, including decreased contentedness, calmness, and positive emotions.
* **Boost your brainpower.** When you drink more water, you may improve your cognitive performance, too. Several studies have shown that people drinking water during cognitive tasks performed much better than those people who did not drink water during the tasks. These results have been found in both adults and children. Studies suggest that even mild dehydration can impair cognitive function in the short-term. So next time you need to focus, take a test or use all of your brainpower, keep a bottle of water next to you and keep sipping.
* **Prevent headaches.** Water deprivation is a very common cause of headache. In most cases, rehydrating can provide relief from a headache. For some people, dehydration can also trigger a migraine, so be sure to keep your water intake regular if you are prone to getting migraines or headaches.
* **Protect against disease.** One of the most important answers to the question “Why is water important?” is its role in disease prevention. Proper hydration may be a useful tool in preventing a variety of health conditions and diseases. Staying hydrated may protect against kidney stones, constipation, asthma, urinary tract infections, coronary heart disease, and even possibly some cancers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**So now That we Know how Important it to drink Water, How much Water we Should drink on a daily base?**  
The amount of water needed each day varies from person to person, depending on how active they are, how much they sweat, and so on.There is no fixed amount of water that must be consumed daily, but there is general agreement on what a healthy fluid intake is.According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the average recommended daily intake of water from both food and drink is:

* For men: Around 3.7 liters or 125 ounces
* For women: Around 2.7 liters or 91 ounces

This would be around 15.5 cups for men and just over 11 cups for women. However, around 80 percent of this should come from drinks, including water, and the rest will be from food.This means that:

* Men should drink around 100 ounces, or 12.5 cups of fluid
* Women should drink around 73 ounces, or just over 9 cups

Fresh fruits and vegetables and all non-alcoholic fluids count towards this recommendation.Times when it is most important to drink plenty of water include:

* when you have a fever
* when the weather is hot
* if you have diarrhea and vomiting
* when you sweat a lot, for example, due to physical activity.

Now that's not an easy task to drink all this water on daily base, we need to have good habits to do it But there is 1 more good way to drink that much!What about making the Action of drinking a -FUN- thing?Research show us that If you have water near you and you are enjoying the action of drinking you WILL drink much more!  
So how you do it?

1. Have a Bottle of water near you.
2. Add some Fruit to Enjoy drinking.
3. Keep a source of water (Like the Bottle) near you all the time.
4. Don't expect to drink the amount you need after 1 day, its a process, just build the Habit.

Here is the Bottle I use: [https://www.healingwavess.com/collections/accessories/products/water-bottle-h20](https://www.healingwavess.com/collections/accessories/products/water-bottle-h20) 

It helped me combining Water - Fruit and FUN!

Sleep Hygiene 101,"Sleep can have a major impact on one’s health and ability to function day to day, yet many people do not get enough. How often at work or school do you hear people complaining about not getting enough sleep or even worse, bragging about not getting enough? The [CDC] has previously reported the 1 in every 3 American’s do not get enough sleep and other sources claim even higher statistics. So, what you do need to do if you want to fix your sleep situation?

**Sleep Routine**
If you have to get up for work at 5 am during the weekdays, you should not spend every weekend staying up all night and sleeping in past noon. That is not to say you can’t have late nights and/or sleep in, especially if you are feeling run down and can use the extra sleep, but you should not be doing it every weekend. Once you get yourself use to a set routine, you will have an easier time going to bed at night and feel more refreshed and awake in the morning.

**Caffeine**

The effects of caffeine can often be felt for 6+ hours depending on your sensitivity and amount drank. The [Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine]( http://jcsm.aasm.org/viewabstract.aspx?pid=29198) reported a study that drinking coffee within 6 hours of going to sleep can have negative effects on your overall sleep. If you struggle to fall asleep at night and are a fan of caffeine, cut back on the total amount of caffeine you drink as well as how late in the day you drink it. Try to avoid having caffeine after noon and if you have to, aim for items on the lower end of the caffeine scale (tea for example). Everyone is different and genetics can play a big role in caffeine sensitivity, so play around with when you drink caffeine to see how it is affecting your sleep.

**Avoid the bed**
The bed should only serve two purposes, sleep and sex. Avoid laying down in the bed for anything else as it can sometimes cause the body to disassociated bed time with being awake doing something else. Do not lay down in bed to watch T.V or read. Go sit elsewhere and get away from the bed.

**Avoid Smoking/Alcohol**
Even though drinking may make you fall asleep (or pass out), it suppresses REM sleep which is vital for a truly restorative nights sleep. This is one many wake up still feeling tired or groggy after a heavy drinking despite a full nights sleep.  Smoking also many have a negative effect on REM sleep, but it also serves as a stimulant thus making it more difficult to fall asleep at night.



**Physical activity/inactivity**
For some people, exercising right before bed leaves them amped up and they struggle to fall asleep. For others, it does not matter. This can also be amplified by the use of pre-workout caffeine supplements. The key here is experiment and see how your body is affected. If you find working out stimulates you, do your workout earlier or get up earlier and work out in the morning. On the other side of the coin, a lack of physical activity can cause sleep issues (along with numerous other negative health consequences).


**Hunger**

For some people, going to be hungry can be it extremely difficult to fall asleep. For others, a full meal that leaves them bloated makes them struggle to sleep. They key here is to know yourself and set up a system that works for you. If you know you get hungry at night, have later meals and/or plan to have a snack before bed. If you struggle with sleep due to feeling full, avoid late night food or figure out what foods trigger that feeling. Now, this advice is not saying make it a free for all with your food choices. If you are trying to control your weight/diet, pick things that fit in within your diet/calories. An apple before bed may be all you need.

Helping future generations," About a year ago, a family member of mine got divorced. I didn’t know what to tell them since I had never been through it. That’s when the idea hit me. There should be a way for people to find other people that have gone through experiences. Over the last few months, I created a website called Oculore.com to solve that problem. Oculore finds people that have gone through something in their life and gotten through it, or just have some special skill. The website then opens  them up to the world. During a time and a date that they decide, these people can share what they have been through and help people all around them. My goal is to try to help millions of people, and as that is a hard goal, any support to the website would be much appreciated and I would be very thankful. 

I wish everyone well.

Lifestyle Wellness Centre – Toronto Wellness Centres vs. Dr. Google,"  

Today more than ever it seems that people across Toronto want to take control of their own holistic health. And by holistic health, I am not just talking about a healthy body – although that is certainly essential. I’m also taking about healthy emotions, thoughts and relationships because these, after all, can have a significant impact on your physical health. 

Such is the quest of so many that there are literally thousands of websites and YouTube videos that people can turn to in order to find wellness advice. The fact that many of these present conflicting information is another matter altogether, but the fact remains that Dr. Google is very much present in our society. Many others, however, still prefer a personal touch to data that is gleaned from the internet which is why alternative and natural wellness centres are becoming popular. 

So is it better to connect with a wellness centre than do your own research on the internet? The answer to that really depends on you and your circumstances, but here are some questions to ask yourself. 

*1.* W*hat sources am I trusting?*

Now let’s be clear, there are many reputable and highly educated doctors, naturopaths and other wellness coaches that offer online information, but there are also just as many con artists. When you seek out information on the internet, you need to do a bit more due diligence to ensure you are trusting in a reputable source. Wherever you obtain your data, carefully check the credentials of the people who have posted the information, check testimonials and ratings, and read other user comments. 

*2.* *Could I benefit from a more personal touch?*

Again, there are some great websites out there with some great advice but oftentimes people are more successful in changing their lifestyle when they have a coach/expert who can encourage them and answer their questions directly. 

Even the most disciplined of us can slip when there is no “real” person to be accountable to. Luckily, that person can be live or virtual. 

*3.*  *Would I be better off with a personalized plan?* 

If you are facing specific health challenges or have particular goals in mind, a wellness centre expert can tailor a program specifically to suit your needs. People often find this easier and more effective than trying to stitch together a plan for themselves based on information they find online. 

As mentioned, there are an abundance of great online sources if you’re willing to do a little legwork to ensure they are reputable and it’s wonderful that in today’s world, such information is so readily accessible. If you are looking to take control of your health, I commend you for doing the research to get better and taking control of what you personally can do to improve your health.

Headspace Cleanse," Just overthunk it? Woke up with that bottomless feeling in your stomach? Quarter life crises, work anxieties, socializing anxieties, toxic relationships… there’s always that one thing that threatens to push us over the edge, into the rabbit hole of overthinking, anxiety and just feeling low. 

But selfcare is human-rights! So we list out anti-spiralling chants to repeat to yourself if you are slipping into any of these 6 sinkholes. 

## 1. The Post Break Up Obsessive Overthink

This is a rite of passage, heyo! Has happened, will happen, more coming your way. Brace for impact. It will feel like a black hole sucking you in, but this too shall pass. Repeat these power quips whenever you feel a wallow coming on. And you’ll be a break up boss in no time!

2. Work Woes

Boss cross? Colleague stole your show? Deadlines got a fist around your heart and squeezing hard? No fear, caresauce is here. These are called growing pains, life is just stretching you a bit. All you have to do is breathe and remember you can ace it when your rewire your mindset (or headset!). Time to change your wallpaper to one of these motivational mantras.

￼3. Living At Home x Family Drama

The M-word or the K-word or just generally, the J-word. I’m talking marriage, kids and jobs, keep up people! Yes, one’s fam is supposed to be uber-supportive, and it’s annoying when you just can’t make them see your pov. And it can just weigh you down so much. It’s time to check-in with what your own values are and stand firm. If these are the cards you’re dealt, time to learn the rules of this kind of poker.

4. Quarter-Life Crisis

Sudden realisation that you’re not your career? Or that the course you’d pursued in college or Master’s coming to haunt you at night? Or getting pulled into the ultimate sinkhole of where-am-I-headed and what-does-it-all-mean?

Most doctors don't check levels in young guys, so most men can't be sure whether they are experiencing symptoms that can be directly correlated to low testosterone, a result of lifestyle factors or as they get older.

I'd like to share with you!,"Tangible Muscle Theory: A method of massage based on how the body’s musculature works together.  Using the pain source as a reference point to get to the root cause.

I have worked with the public and on myself for several years also along with studying health and wellness online and through books. I have begun to inaugurate a massage modality based on how the musculature of the body works together to function.  I call this modality Tangible Muscle Theory or TMT for short.  Muscles usually work together in groups or pairs to perform action/motion.  These actions are have three parts: a protagonist, antagonist, and synergist. To perform the action/motion, for example a flexion at the elbow, the protagonist /main mover in this case, is the bicep. The antagonist would be the triceps, and the synergist would be the brachialis of the side of your upper arm. Muscles need all parts to be working together properly just like a machine in order to perform properly with out dysfunction. The idea that an issue in your triceps (antagonist) would potentially cause a pain in your bicep (protagonist) is the very first principle of my method Tangible Muscle Theory (TMT). The following are the 4 principals of TMT.

Four Principles of TMT

1.       Pain caused by agonist or synergist muscle.

2.       Main mover or other muscles at the joint proximal or distal to the pained muscle or joint.

3.      Muscle that touch, share attachment point or fascia I’ll call this a kinetic chain.

4.      Postural, nerve compression, activities of daily living and fascia.

10 “hacks” to feel better throughout the day,"I’m writing this post as I’ve had several discussions with friends and family, over the past month or so, about routines and “hacks” to change your state when feeling “off”. 
 
These are the things I do when I feel dysfunctional at work, stressed at home, or anxious before jumping into bed. 

Depending on your location, some of these things may or may not be doable. Here goes:

1. Eat (you might be hangry)
2. Stretch (you might be stiff)
3. Hydrate (you might be dehydrated)
4. Exercise (always a good idea)
5. Foam roll (like getting a massage)
6. Power nap (you might be tired)
7. Wim Hof breaths (google this one)
8. Take a cold shower (amazing for soreness)
9. Compliment someone (feels good)
10. Think about things you're grateful for

ARE YOU USING THE RIGHT SHAMPOO?," 

https://i.redd.it/czntjgcdhzl11.jpg

Gone are the days when shampoos were not popular, and soap was used from head to toe, but since there has been a lot of progress in the world, the shampoos have also made a progress. Did you know that there exists a very broad category of shampoos, which has been brought into the market by the multi-billion dollar beauty industry! Personality Ikon – beauty salon in Kanpur brings you various shampoos which exist to take care of your strands and scalp.

**The major categories of Shampoo to exist are as mentioned below-**

**Clarifying Shampoo**

It is the deep cleaning shampoo which contains heavy-duty surfactants. The aim is to remove any build-up caused by using too many substantive products over a long time like heavy conditioners, hair sprays, silicone products, gels etc.

**Everyday Shampoo**

An everyday shampoo is the exact opposite of a clarifying shampoo. It is a very mild shampoo which contains mild surfactants, just like a baby shampoo.

**Oily Hair Shampoo**

The oily hair shampoo is nearly like the clarifying shampoo. These shampoos are designed to enhance sebum removal from the scalp and hair. This is accomplished by the selection of strong detergents and the minimal use of conditioners.

**Normal Hair Shampoo**

These shampoos clean fine and leave behind a slight layer of conditioning as well. They usually contain sulfates balanced with other surfactants. They are formulated to clean just plenty for normal sebum production.

**Dry, Damaged Hair Shampoo**

These shampoos are mild. Their goal is to cleanse softly and deposit protective layers in the hair. The detergents remove the environmental dirt and sebum from the hair in the water-soluble phase.

**Coloured Hair Shampoo**

They are mild and tend to add conditioning like the ones for dry damaged hair. Some of these shampoos will have color boosters added to help revive the shades. Many have UV protecting ingredients and antioxidants to protect the color.

Once you are through with identifying which shampoo would suit you the best, make sure you don’t apply a huge amount of shampoo and also dilute it in water before applying. Also, make sure you take good care of your, like going for a regular haircut or trimming at best salon in Kanpur.",Wellness,1536834820,PersonalityIkon,0,1,True,2018-09-13
3 Ways to Achieve Wellness,"Wellness is a word we hear buzzing around quite frequently these days.  Wellness as defined by the Random House Dictionary is :

*1. The quality or state of being healthy in body and mind, especially as the result of deliberate effort.*

*2. An approach to healthcare that emphasizes preventing illness and prolonging life, as opposed to emphasizing treating diseases.*

So how do we achieve wellness? Is it all about diet? Is it all about exercise? Is it all about meditating?  While those activities and disciplines are part of the path the wellness, they cannot get you all the way.

Typical ways to relieve stress are to run, [workout](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819592/), shop, have a glass of wine, escape into a movie or book etc. While these are all perfectly acceptable ways to distract ourselves and give short term relief from stress, unless we release it, our stress will be back tomorrow to say hello and the cycle starts all over.

The same cycle occurs with all the other wellness blockers- worry, relationship issues, guilt, anger, grief, depression and the list goes on. Often, we provide ourselves with short term relief but no long term solution. 

In order to get to the next level of wellness most of us need to invest a lot more time and resources so we can get to *release* all the wellness blockers we carry around with us. Once these blockers have been removed wellness becomes an effortless lifestyle. The old temptations are no longer an issue, the old triggers no longer fire and life becomes an adventure every day. 

So what is involved in releasing these blockers? There is no size fits all solution and rarely is there a silver bullet (although that does happen sometimes!!), but here are 3 wellness builders I recommend in addition to a clean eating lifestyle and regular exercise program.

**1- Massage:** A quality massage regularly is [terrific for the body](https://www.healthline.com/health/osteoarthritis-pain-stress)\- all that organ and tissue manipulation releases tons of stored toxins and the gift of touch from a skilled masseuse will releases all the stress stored in our trigger points. 

**2-** [**Breathing**](https://www.healthline.com/health/4-7-8-breathing)**:** Big deep belly breaths are one of the best ways we can love our bodies. The large belly breaths engages the diaphragm, which massages our internal organs, gut associated lymph tissue and digestive track. This results in improved digestion and elimination of toxins from the body. The infusion of oxygen supports our cellular mitochondria and cell repair mechanisms. It also sends our bodies into a much higher vibration frequency, so we feel lighter and more energetic. To learn more about breath work, please contact me at drmaryosfitness@gmail.com

**3-  Raindrop Technique (RDT):**  This is a specialized way to apply a series of therapeutic essential oils to the body. It was developed by Gary Young and is the result of combining Lakota wisdom with the latest in essential oil research. The results of a 60 minute RDT can include energy alignment, stress relief and the harmonious balance of every system in the body. ",Wellness,1536860322,Recent_Pepper,0,2,True,2018-09-13

Vitamin questions,"Why aren't all vitamins just ""100%"" daily value to make sure we get our daily supplement? And why do they have such drastic ranges from 2% to over 1000% of daily needs (\*according to the basic US 2000 calorie diet)

I understand our body wastes a lot of it, but why does my Potassium only give ""2%"" of the daily value? is it poisonous to digest 100% of what we need of Potassium at once? 

And I've heard Vitamin E, if taken in large quantities, can also be poisonous, but it shows the vitamin I take is ""1,233%"" of my daily nutritional need.

Any reason for this?

And apologies if this isn't the thread, r/health doesn't allow for posts, and it didn't seem to fit anywhere else.

L5 Vertebra,"The lowest vertebra in your lumbar spine is the L5. It’s the bone that rests right above your sacral spine, and it’s the most common region of the back to suffer a range of common ailments, from herniated discs to spondylolisthesis. The lumber spine is what’s commonly just called your lower back, and is responsible for support and flexibility in your entire upper body.

Because this region of your back bears so much weight, it’s also very vulnerable to degenerative conditions due to normal age-related wear and tear. Let’s look at the L5 vertebra, the conditions associated with injuries to this region, and where you can find the best chiropractic care to address such problems.

L5 Vertebra Injury Symptoms
---------------------------

Among the nerves that are associated with the L5 vertebra is the sciatic nerve, the source of the common injury known as sciatica. This is the largest nerve in the body, and when it gets irritated or compressed, the patient can experience a range of unpleasant symptoms.

Symptoms of an L5 injury or compression include localized and radiating pain, tingling and numbness, and weakness in the muscles and legs. Symptoms can travel as low as the front of the lower leg or even into the feet. These conditions can be extremely debilitating and disruptive. Some patients may find they are no longer able to wiggle their toes, and could even experience loss of function or paralysis.

Common L5 Spinal Conditions
---------------------------

Common conditions that affect the spine at the L5 region include herniated or bulging discs, generation of bone spurs, and the condition known as degenerative disc disease. Osteoarthritis is also a common condition developing in this region. Many such injuries can be caused by the loss of fluid and elasticity due to the wearing out of the disc that cushions the spine.

Woodbridge, VA, Chiropractors

If you’re suffering from any of the above conditions associated with the L5 vertebra, you should seek help from a qualified professional.

CALORIES,"CALORIE in nutrition context is the unit of food energy. The word calorie is popularly used with the number of kilocalories of nutritional energy measured and quoted as ""calories per serving"" or ""kilocalories per 100 g"".

A nutritional requirement or consumption is often expressed in calories per day. One gram of fat in food contains nine kilocalories, while a gram of either a carbohydrate or a protein contains approximately four kilocalories. Alcohol in food contains seven kilocalories per gram. You can find calories also described as “Kcal”.

In the picture, there are “GOOD” and “BAD” calories, as most of the people know it.

WHICH ONE WOULD YOU PICK? Of course, you know the second picture is “the right” chose but we know you would prefer the first picture.

WHY NOT TRY THE BALANCE?

A calorie doesn’t change the fact to a healthier life, you can choose the second picture and it will the BEST choice, but you can also have the first picture into your life. Because, if your diet is based on the calories you take per day, traditionally HEALTH foods tend to be advantageous for weight loss as you will feel less hungry, will be more filling and also more micro dense, but both calories example should be an element of balance. If you get a rigid diet depriving yourself of “bad” calories you will give up to be healthier, entirely.

As CarnaVita wants to insert health into your life, equilibrate the diet will make you stick to it more as possible.

So, we can introduce to your life the balance to have a healthy lifestyle.

You can start eating “good” calories with one of our excellent nutrition support to five this control and balance in your life and PLUS you will have a training support from our personals trainers.

sleep matters!,"Many people don’t think much about sleep until they’re not getting enough of it. The average adult needs seven to nine full hours of sleep to be fully rested.

However, there are behaviors and habits you can develop to improve your chances of getting the rest you need.

Many people who suffer from unexplained chronic pain find that the source is that they’re under a lot of pressure in their lives. Whether it’s family troubles, money problems, work issues or any other reason, the more stressed out you are, the more your body gets out of sync and the more likely you are to suffer pain.

The problem with stress-related pain is that if you don’t know what you’re looking for, it can be very hard to identify it. The truth is, stress can be at the root of headaches, back pain, neck pain, shoulder and muscle aches, stomach pain and all manner of problems.

Stress causes our body to tense up, which can lead to the pain you experience in your neck, shoulders, back, muscles, stomach and head. It can also cause your body’s hormone responses to be off, which in turn lowers your immunity to illness. It can cause you to have sleepless nights, affect your memory and focus, and make you irritable.

It can cause overeating, fatigue, mood swings and more. Every one of these stress-related conditions can, in some way, contribute to the development and worsening of pain in the body. As you hunch, it creates unhealthy positioning in your spine, which can lead to subluxations. These in turn put stress on nerves that cause other issues. It becomes a vicious cycle from which it’s tough to escape.

Managing Pain, Managing Stress
------------------------------

The first step in managing your pain in these cases is to manage your stress. That means first admitting that you’re stressed out and that you’re not coping well. Only you can fix you, by eliminating the conditions that are causing you discomfort. After this realization, look towards activities that can help you burn off some of the stress you feel.

Go to the gym. Take a martial arts, yoga or self-defense class. Go for a walk or a run. You should be getting at least 30 minutes to an hour of exercise, at least three times a week, anyway. Don’t tell yourself that you don’t have the time, and don’t let it become another stressor. Just make the time and do it!

Don’t ever be afraid to take time away. Whether it’s a vacation, a long weekend, or just a few hours a week in a room by yourself pursuing a hobby, you’re entitled to some “you” time, even if you have a family to take care of. In fact, it’ll be better for them as well!

Circadian Rhythm by Certified Lutron Installers,"[Palladiom Keypads, Ketra, LED Lighting, Motorized Shades + Circadian Rhythm](https://i.redd.it/u3xp7rna46f11.jpg)

Here at [Old Cove](https://www.oldcovellc.com), we pride ourselves in the certifications we have received. To become a [Lutron](http://www.lutron.com/) ***HomeWorks QS*** and ***RadioRa2*** dealer is no easy task.

Kevin Marra and I started our company back in 2010. It took us 3 years of hard work to even get Lutron’s attention. Most companies average 15 years in business before getting a chance to sell high-end Lutron. To our surprise, it was never about the numbers to them, it was all about the relationship.

Lutron is a family-run company with a long list of standard-setting patents within the lighting and shade industry. On top of that, most of their talent is comprised of 20+ year employees (this shows you something about a happy work life!).

Considering we are all about old school business practices, we knew this was a company we needed to be a part of. With the help of our rep Scott Davis, we have progressed into some of the highest ranks of their product offerings.

Sure, you can walk into Home Depot and buy the simple Lutron Caseta dimmers and switches. These types of systems work well in a single-room or small apartment (up to 50 devices). As your project scales up in size + quality, that’s when you need to consider RadioRa2 or HomeWorks.

[RadioRa2](http://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/WholeHomeSystems/RadioRA2/Overview.aspx) is a system that allows up to 200 devices; this includes dimmers, switches, keypads and shades. RadioRa2 is a great solution for anyone who wants to retrofit their current house. All it takes is a one-for-one swap of existing dimmers + switches with RadioRa2 hardware. Even better, the equipment works with traditional electrical wiring to keep things straightforward.

Once the RadioRa2 is installed, Old Cove enters the 2nd phase with our certified programmers. This is when we add keypad scenes and automatic schedules. For instance, a “Welcome” button will turn a pathway on as you enter your property. At sunrise, your shades will automatically open to gradually wake you up. After all, awakening multiple senses starts your day in a relaxing way.

If you are building a new house or have a larger system that requires over 200 devices, you should look at Lutron [HomeWorks QS](http://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/WholeHomeSystems/Homeworksqs/Overview.aspx). This is the technology that allows us to break out of the “simple” system and deliver a truly unique experience.

With Lutron HomeWorks, the ideal design includes [Ketra](https://www.ketra.com/news/ketra-joins-lutron) LED light fixtures, schedules that focus on circadian rhythm and matching color schemes to your interior design.

By choosing Old Cove as your certified Lutron professional, you are guaranteed the highest level of service and quality. Backed by the industry-leading company in lighting and shades, we are here to be your #1 resource in light fixtures, LEDs, [Sivoia QS motorized shades](http://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/ShadingSystems/SivoiaQS/Overview.aspx), energy-conscious builds and wellness focused solutions.

Did we mention this is the same technology used by the White House, Empire State Building, NASA HQ, LEGOLAND and more? There is a reason why the best choose Lutron! Ask us how to get started!",Wellness,1533864293,oldcove,0,1,True,2018-08-09

"Based in UK &amp; need better pillow to reduce neck pain, any suggestions?","So I've been finding it really hard to find a pillow that actually supports my neck and shoulders when I sleep at night. I've gone through several pillows in the last year, including a cheap £10 Dunelm pillow, a slightly more expensive £30 John Lewis pillow and a more expensive £60 Evesleep memory foam pillow.

All of them feel okay for the first 2 nights and then I end up waking up with stiff neck and shoulders. I have a knot in my left shoulder that is there almost every day (I sleep a lot on my right side).

Any suggestions? I am based in the UK. I sleep mostly on my back and side. I don't think I am into memory foam as it's too hard from what I've experienced.

Benefits of a wellness center after work ?,"Hello ! 

First post in this community :)

I am hesitating in joining a wellness center (we call it spa here but I am not sure if it is the same in English) this center has:  
pool, sauna, hammam, beds, gym, jacuzzi, towel services etc 

It is really high end and therefore expensive.

So my though is to go there everyday to keep in shape and stay away from screens and computers (as everybody today I am on it every single seconds and it is starting to be too much), do you think this kind of place is great for the mind and body ? what kinds of benefits would I find by doing this ? 

any feedback from potential users of such centers ?",Wellness,1531130208,SirSirae,1,3,True,2018-07-09

"The Bitter Truth About Sugar, Salt, Preservatives, and the Health Care System","Do you ever go grab some breakfast at your local burger joint when you’re rushing off to work and have no time to even fix yourself a sandwich? Chances are, like countless others, this becomes your daily routine because it’s more convenient than having to prepare breakfast at home. The convenience they offer is one big reason why fast-food establishments are so popular in the first place. Millions of Americans take this lifestyle for granted, but many don’t realize just how dangerous it is, especially in the long-term. Because the reality is, fast food is junk, and feeding your body junk on a regular basis doesn’t just deprive your body of the nourishment it needs, but has potentially deadly consequences, too.

Heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and many other diseases are so common nowadays that it’s become perfectly normal to be suffering from one of these illnesses. The truth is, the current national health situation is the culmination of decades of deceit, an intentional misleading of the American public as to what’s good for their health and what isn’t. Dr. Martha H. Howard, MD, tells the whole story behind these lies. Her book, Alive and Well: Your Survival Guide for the Health Care Apocalypse exposes, for example, how the food and drug industries along with politicians and various private and government organizations connived to hide the facts from the public. Dr. Howard explains clearly and in plain language not only that being sick is the new normal, but how that could ever come to be.

In Alive and Well: Your Survival Guide for the Health Care Apocalypse, Dr. Howard takes a natural approach to healing. She shows us how illness is usually a result of our eating something that we may have been allergic to all this time but have simply been unaware of, and that a simple change in our diet will solve the problem. Or we could be exposed to something in our homes that causes an allergic reaction, in which case, simply removing the cause removes the sickness. This approach contrasts with the prescribe-a-pill attitude of most doctors today which often makes already sick people even worse instead of curing them. While many medicines may be effective in alleviating a particular symptom or set of symptoms, they usually can cause a number of side effects. And just stopping the symptoms from reappearing doesn’t cure the actual cause of the sickness, leaving the underlying problem unresolved and the patient ill. This usually means that patients then become dependent on these drugs to deal with recurring symptoms, and this dependence can last for many years or even a lifetime, resulting in thousands of dollars wasted on continuing medication that’s totally unnecessary.

Dr. Howard also tells us that our health care system is an accomplice to all this. Reports indicate that while the US health care system is one of the most expensive in the world by far, it could very well be the worst-performing in the world, too. One report shows sixteen countries that have the best health care systems in the world, and very noticeably the US is nowhere on the list. So what exactly are Americans paying for? Dr. Howard’s book has the answers.

Another area in which there has been a concerted effort to deceive the public is food. There is documentary evidence that scientists were paid decades ago by a sugar industry group to state that one of the principal causes of coronary heart disease is fat, which caused food manufacturers to market “fat-free” foods that were then touted as “safe” for consumption. The reality is that sugar is the culprit, but since the public has since been focused on the fat content of their food, they completely ignored its sugar content, which was and is usually very high. In Dr. Howard’s opinion, this has ruined the health of Americans for decades, which explains the number of epidemics that the US has been saddled with for so many years. There’s heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, for example. And what’s much worse is, even kids are now afflicted with diseases that people used to get only in their middle age such as high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure.

Dr. Martha H. Howard’s book, Alive and Well: Your Survival Guide for the Health Care Apocalypse, is one of the most important books that you can read today. It can turn your life around and make you and your loved ones feel better, live better, and avoid the sicknesses that have unfortunately become so normal today.

T12 Vertebra,"The T12, or twelfth thoracic vertebra is the largest of all your thoracic vertebrae, and is the lowermost in the back. It’s designed to bear the weight of your spine, and is the strongest of all vertebrae in the region, but it’s also the most prone to injuries from stress. It’s a sort of hybrid that possesses the features of a thoracic and a lumbar vertebra.

The region of your spinal cord protected by this vertebra controls your abdominal muscles, lower back, stability and support. Unfortunately, pain from a T12 injury can be tricky to diagnose as it can radiate to other areas of your body and not be centered where the injury actually is.

Injuries to the T12 Vertebra
----------------------------

Injuries to the[T12 vertebra](http://www.innerbody.com/anatomy/skeletal/t12-12th-thoracic-vertebra)can result in pain in the back, around your rib cage, in your abdominal muscles, or even radiating down into your legs. It’s important to have the injury properly diagnosed, as certain conditions including cancer, infection and even scoliosis can result in similar symptoms.

How a Chiropractor Helps
------------------------

A chiropractor knows how to perform the proper tests and evaluations to learn whether your condition is caused by a spinal subluxation or misalignment. Such tests can involve MRIs, x-rays, and physical examinations by touch. When they have determined the specific cause of the problem, they can adjust your spine to treat misalignments, bulging or herniated discs, or other injuries you may have suffered.

Often, a problem with the T12 can be treated very conservatively using physical therapy and chiropractic adjustments. Chiropractors favor non-invasive approaches to treating spinal injuries, without the need for surgery or pumping your body full of chemicals and drugs. A chiropractor always seeks to treat the underlying cause, and thousands of patients have found relief through gentle and non-invasive adjustments of this kind.

Thinking about opening up a wellness service business for a while now – any software recommendations or horror stories out there??,"Looking for the right booking, employee scheduling, inventory tracking, and business management software.

Anyone have great experiences with MindBody. I know they just gobbled up booker. Have heard some rough things about their admin side and personally have had weird booking experiences as a customer, but I assume they're good enough if they're so huge, right?

Wellness living is another I've seen ads for.

Also came across this smaller company, Float Helm, that was recommended highly by just one person.(website is intruiging but haven't got much further)

I know there's things like Square or Schedulicity that can integrate well into payment contracts and basic booking.

Seems like such a shifting landscape and any guidance would be welcome! Anyone with any experience or impressions on any of those!",Wellness,1525386218,frenjaminbench,0,1,True,2018-05-03

Why You Periodically Need to Reboot Yourself,"It’s gotten to the point where a computer analogy is the best way to explain human exhaustion: overwork, and you will crash. Every day we hear about someone who has been forced to ‘take a break’ from work after a particularly spell in the hospital. Why are so many people falling sick?

Non-Communicable Diseases

There are millions of posts online about how work place stress has caused long term health effects such as increased blood pressure, high cholesterol, hypertension etc. People suffer nervous breakdowns on the eve of exams and promotions; others experience a heart-attack on a normal day going home from work; and every year at the annual medical check-up, doctors find more and more people suffering from non-communicable diseases. 
It’s normal to feel that missing a day off work or not going in on that Saturday when everyone else will be is the end of your career. However, overworking and then crashing is a more permanent end to your career – and it’s a lot more probable. The best remedy is to go to a luxury Ayurveda health retreat every few months and getting your system rebooted.

Benefits of a Full Treatment

There is a lot research about the benefits of undergoing Ayurvedic treatment even for disease-free individuals, but especially for those looking for permanent cures. In the modern Western medical practice, most diseases are treated on a symptomatic basis, whereas Ayurveda looks at an individual holistically and adjusts everything from diet to lifestyle in order to improve their health. The all-natural decoctions, massage oils, syrups, detox regiments and diets are all designed to reenergize people by getting rid of all the toxic build-up in the body caused by stress, tension, eating highly-processed food etc.   

The Ayurvedic practitioners will first determine what imbalance in your three doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) is causing your disease or overall fatigue. Then, they will arrange for appropriate treatment, be it oleation, massage, herbal baths, sweating, enemas, decoctions etc. The goal of these treatments is to bring you’re the three doshas in your body back into balance so that it works harmoniously. The upshot of this is that it also allows your mind to relax and let go of the stresses that plagued you before.

Back Home

The treatments will not be fully successful unless you learn how to bring some of those practices into your own life. Learn how to cook without using too many condiments. Make it a point to have at least one meal per day that is fresh. Try to leave work early, or if that isn’t possible, take the occasional weekend off. Find a hobby and engage with that whole heartedly. Remind yourself that work isn’t everything, that your health and peace of mind matters more.
Do the best you can to rearrange your priorities so that you and your well-being tops the list.

Looking for some guidance,"Hi all, I wanted some advice that is much needed in my mental state.

I finished 15 weeks of an intense school schedule while working 30 hours a week. It left for no sleep, maybe 2-4 hours per night, insane stress, poor eating habits, no exercise, and horrible mental state.

I thought booking a trip to the Bahamas would help, but I’ve come back and I still feel overloaded and stressed.

I find simple things to do like organizing my clothes, doing dishes, and cooking hard to do.

It’s hard to engage in conversation. I just feel like I need silence still.

Any advice? ",Wellness,1526178136,Mcammed27,0,1,True,2018-05-12

Inviting feedback on new smartphone designed for wellbeing,"Hey there! As I've deepened my meditation practice over the last 5 years, I've become extremely sensitive to how technology gets in the way of every facet of my life. This has led to an exploration to reimagine how our tools could support a life of deeper presence, focus and human connection.

After several iterations of this journey, we have finally released [Siempo](http://www.getsiempo.com), an Android app that transforms your phone into a more intentional and less distracting experience. If our smartphones currently resemble a Times Square, what might a Zen garden or retreat center look like? To start, we've removed all apps from the home screen, and unbranded and greyscaled their icons. We let you batch notifications to your desired interval, and personalize the intention/mantra you read every time you open your phone. + a number of other features designed to help you build healthier digital habits.

We would love to hear your feedback on the beta version of our app so far. How does it make you feel? What kinds of intentions are you setting on the home screen? What else can we help you with?

Improve Your Well-Being in 2018,"Looking to be happy and healthy in 2018? Then you may be interested in these 17 easy tips to help you improve your health and well-being. Start the New Year off on the right foot by trying some or all of these ideas!

1) Drink more water. Water is a healthy calorie-free and sugar-free beverage option.

2)Add 10 minutes of exercise to your day. If you don’t already exercise, aim to do 10 minutes each day. If you do currently exercise, add 10 extra minutes to your routine.

3)Get moving at work. Aim to stand up more often, or take a quick walk or stretch break.

4)Go to bed 10 minutes earlier. By the end of the week, you’ll get an extra 70 minutes of sleep. Keep it up all year, and you’ll have slept 60 hours more. Imagine how well rested you’ll feel!

5)Commit to one healthy stress-relieving activity per day. You may quickly notice an improvement in your well-being.

6)Pay yourself first. Rather than waiting to see what you have left after your monthly expenses, commit to saving money first.

7)Add an extra serving of fruit or vegetables per day. Each day, find a way to eat one more serving. You may have more opportunities than you realize!

8)Use part of your lunch break to walk. Dedicate at least 5 minutes of your lunch break to walking. Not only will it help you be active, but it can also help you relieve stress.

9)Spend more time with family and friends to relieve stress, laugh more and relax—all of which can help you increase your well-being.

10)Make it a habit to appreciate all you have and the important people in your life.

11)Correct your posture. Your posture can affect both your physical and mental health. Work on keeping your head up, as if you were balancing a book on your head. Avoid slouching!

12)Brush and floss your teeth. Good oral hygiene can promote good general health. Get in the habit of brushing twice and flossing once per day.

13)Control your portions. Limiting your portions is necessary for healthy eating and weight management.

14)Reorganize your kitchen. Throw out foods that are too tempting. Place healthy foods at eye level and in front of unhealthier foods. Clear your counter of treats and junk food and replace with a bowl of fresh fruits and vegetables.

15)Always keep moving. Even if you’re exercising, if you spend long periods of time being inactive, it can be bad for your health.

16)Take time away from your “screens” (cell phone, computer, TV, tablet, etc.) to benefit your physical and mental health.

17)Stay on top of preventive care. Visit your doctor regularly for physicals, blood pressure checks and more.",Wellness,1518843626,kenziecarson,1,1,True,2018-02-17

How to be productive as a new receptionist!!,"I just started a new job as a receptionist last week. Most of what I do involves transferring calls and clicking a button to unlock the door for people, along with other small tasks and occasional busy work. So far, I spend most of my time on reddit, reading the news, or otherwise surfing the internet. This gets boring at an 8-5 job when that is all there is to do.

I am looking for suggestions for more productive/enriching things I can do at the computer or perhaps on paper. Scrolling through reddit and elsewhere is nice, but I would rather be using the time to learn something or help myself somehow.

There are, however, some limitations.

I am allowed to be on the internet but I can not watch videos or play anything with sound.

I can not really have a book or some other activity in front of me, it has to be on the computer or perhaps a notepad.

I don't think I should download large files or programs on the computer.

I have to be alert enough to be able to answer the phones and open the door at any given time.

So does anyone have any ideas? I'm looking for a web series, educational websites of any kind, anything that would be interesting, educational, or entertaining for more than 20 minutes.

NATURAL WAYS TO ENERGIZE YOUR BODY,"At Love From You, we know that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind - but we live busy lives, and sometimes getting that golden 8 hours of sleep every night can seem impossible. 

So, how can you stay energized during crunch time without pounding back 3 soy lattes when you wake up, or worse, your blood sugar levels are crashing in the middle of an important meeting?

Here is a little article from our health and wellness team, to keep you energized and still listening to the natural flow of your body. 

{When I was a teenager, I could sleep two hours, drink an energy drink, roll out of bed and run to work without a second thought. It’s just not the same anymore. Now, when I don't get my necessary 7 or 8 hours of sleep I know that the next day is going to need a little bit of extra care.}

So, here are some tried and true, natural (and slightly strange) ways to get an extra kick of energy when your alarm clock wakes you up way too early. 


EAT CHIA SEEDS

Whaa? Chia seeds? Yes. They are chock full of omegas and healthy fatty acids, are a natural metabolism boosting food and make the perfect breakfast on the go. Try soaking them in a bowl with coconut milk, a tsp of coconut oil, and some fresh fruit, (raspberries are my favourite for some natural sugar, and iron rich foods such as apples) In the morning it’s a good idea to avoid complex carbohydrates, and to opt for a meal with some protein and healthy fats. When you wake up you have a nutrient rich chia seed bowl waiting for you. The chia seeds are ready to give you a great natural energy boost, and also ready to have #healthyliving pic snapped for your Instagram.


2.  DRINK GREEN TEA (OR MATCHA) 

Sometimes coffee can feel a little bit harsh, so when you need an energy booster and are trying to avoid coffee, try drinking some concentrated green tea or matcha. Matcha is green tea powder, and can be made in a latte. It contains vitamins and antioxidants, and doesn't have the same caffeine crash as a regular cup of coffee.  I opt to have a matcha latte made with almond milk, and without sugar. It feels like caffeine and a cleanse at the same time. 

3.  HYDRATE

Often we’re dehydrated and don't even realize it. {As I wrote this sentence, I yawned, and opted to get a glass of water.} Hydrating gives your body what it craves, some classic H2O.  Most of us are walking around as dehydrated dried out humans and a lot of our health problems would be solved if we just drank more water. Other than the fact that our bodies are mostly made from water and we’d die without drinking it, here’s a WebMD article to give you more of an incentive to drink it {https://www.webmd.com/diet/features/6-reasons-to-drink-water}.



4.  PHYSICAL EXERCISE 

Try to fit in a few minutes of exercise on your to do list each morning. Do some squats (maybe not in the office), go for a quick jog, take the stairs, ride the New York subway, try to navigate a shopping mall in heels, etc. There are a million little ways to get a few minutes of exercise in when you feel an adrenal fatigue coming on. I usually try to have a gym within close proximity to my work hub, so that when I feel stressed or tired I can go for a 15 minute workout and cold shower. This leaves me feeling refreshed and ready to get back into the work flow. Physical exercise has so many benefits beyond the classic weight loss motivation; it relieves stress, gets blood circulation to the brain and helps you sleep better at night.

"Tax Season Is Coming, But We're Forgetting How to Live in the Moment","Recently, I've found myself working numbingly to reach financial goals. Tax season is here and I'm realizing how much I'm really earning after doing all the accounting. This sort of cascaded into me trying to make up for it this year by working harder. Before I knew it, I was neglecting my social life and stopped doing things I enjoyed – all in the name of a paycheck. I didn't realize it until now. But work was eating up my life.

Are we really still living if we're not living? I mean, here I am slaving away and not realizing I'm slaving away at work. It's because mainstream society praises high incomes and being “productive.” But in the end, it looks like the more you work, the more signs of clinical depression you're showing, right?

Here are some symptoms of clinical depression that you get when you focus on work: [Source] (http://www.wellnessnova.com/2017/10/study-shows-yoga-can-help-combat-depression/)

1. Increased irritability. While being more focused on work, I'm more irritable because I'm trying to get things done at a productive rate. Anything that slows me down makes me irritable. When people call me on the phone, I get irritated at the slightest things – like if they're talking too slow or won't hang up. I get irritated at stop lights. I get irritated at standing in line.

2. No longer interested in activities or interests I used to enjoy. When I'm more focused on work, I stopped wanting to do things I liked, like watching T.V., going to the bar, talking to friends, playing a few games online, etc.. Instead, I'm slaving away for my paycheck.

3. Change in sleep. The definition of insomnia is not sleeping regularly, right? Well, sometimes I bring home work with me, and that means it cuts into my sleeping time. Some nights I only sleep 4 hours.

4. Fatigue and loss of energy. Working too hard made me tired more often, something coffee couldn't cure.

The list goes on, you know? And I'm sure lots of people who are working hard also share these symptoms. Why is it praised in society to have these symptoms just because you're working? But they're dangerous red flags for clinical depression too? I don't get it.

I think it's time for us to live in the present again. To live in the moment. I think society is training us to lose our individuality and our freedom all in the name of corporations. We forget that we're powerful, free, and have free will. I think we should take charge of our lives – it's not about what society wants for us, but what we want for us.
