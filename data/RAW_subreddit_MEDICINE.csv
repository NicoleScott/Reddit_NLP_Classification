The Indian population has extremely mixed feelings towards doctors. Doctors are venerated like gods, and miracles are expected of them; however when those miracles fail to happen (owing to the limitations of biology and medical sciences) people are quick to turn on the very same person they initially looked to for help.

Treatments are expected, not hoped for - and miracles are demanded.

Patients who have spent all their lives abusing their bodies come to hospitals far too late for medical science to be of any help; they arrive en masse with truckloads of family, friends, neighbors and local goons. If, unfortunately, satisfactory outcomes aren't achieved, the crowd is quick to turn into a mob, baying for the blood of anyone in a white coat. The doctor does not necessarily need to be the one treating the patient - anyone with a stethoscope will do.

There is a widespread mistrust of doctors, with doctors being painted as money-hungry good-for-nothings who profit off the misery of others.

There are several problems with the healthcare system within India, and yet the steps being taken by the government to improve the state of affairs are either wholly misguided, or non existent.

This is just another one in a long list of attacks on Indian doctors. The story, every time, is similar - old patient who could have been saved only if the family would've brought him to a hospital many months earlier is brought in in a critical condition; patient dies despite the best efforts of the team; patient's family and friends blame the doctor for the death and proceed to cause bodily injury to whoever they see in a white coat. After every attack, junior doctors go on strike, asking for better security, however, no steps are taken (neither to increase hospital security nor to prosecute the aggressors). Eventually, doctors are forced to resume working in substandard conditions, often under threat of losing their jobs (last time this happened in Maharashtra, the residents who went on strike were told by the government that they would be fired if they didn't return to work).

India supplies a large number of doctors to other countries. Perhaps this is why.

I was an intern in a government hospital in an Indian city. One day as I performed CPR in the ER on a lady with an MI, a man threatened to hurt me because I wasn't paying enough attention to his (stable) stroke patient. I was threatened for not providing free antipyretics to a child who was not feverish (I wanted to keep the medicines for an acutely ill child since resources are scarce). I once ran away from the ER when a large mob gathered since as a 5'2"" girl, I would be pretty much dominated in a physical fight and I did not want to be another news story.

Sometimes I feel like being a doctor in India is breaking my spirit.",medicine,1560286535,catedoge282,147,617,True,2019-06-11

"Do you spend time volunteering, or do you instead feel you have done enough “good” at work that this is unnecessary? If you do volunteer, do you do medical or non-medical volunteering?","I often feel that I should volunteer more, but it is often a challenge to actually find the motivation to volunteer. If I volunteer at a free clinic after work it generally improves my overall job satisfaction (the patients are more grateful, there’s no insurance bullshit to deal with, and most problems are straightforward), but the problem of time (or lack thereof) always makes it challenging to squeeze in. Plus, from a more selfish standpoint, I frequently can’t shake the unfortunately complacent feeling that I am “helping” enough at work and can’t give much more.

Turmeric for anxiety and long term use,"So, I’ve been doing now 3 days experiment with turmeric powder. Also I’m doing for about 6 months keto (&lt;15 c).  All because I’ve been suffering from anxiety after overtraining with running and eating junk heavy carb food. 
On the monday, I took about 2 tbsp of turmeric powder with some fatty meat, which gave me headache. But I noticed that I had absolutely no anxiety till the next morning. The next morning I had possibly something like anxiety rebound after I woke up. 
I also added on the monday some probiotics for helping my gut (because there’s some connection between brain and gut). 
Yesterday, I took turmeric again and I felt almost extatic. I was calm like I haven’t been for a very long time. Again, the today I started to feel more anxious in the morning. So I took only a 1/4 tsp. 
Also I found out that it acts more with some cheese (maybe tyramine and MAO-A connection?).
Everything was fine, I was clearheaded, no more anxious... till the turmeric wore off. 

I’m disappointed, because it seems to help me and it’s anti-inflammantionary. 
I’m scared that if I keep on taking it everyday I will develop some dependency. 
Now as it wore off I feel totally tired with low mood...

I know that many people report that they don’t feel anything after turmeric, I’m also very surprised that it’s working for me even in a small dosage. Also I know that there’s no evidence of dependency, so why is this happening to me? Why do I feel WORSE after it wore off?

[Writeup] Hong Kong doctor-lawmaker Pierre Chan in doubt of Hospital Authority's statement over patient privacy,"###TL;DR: Doctor-lawmaker found alleged document from the local healthcare statutory body, which requested A&amp;E doctors to record clinically irrelevant data. This later came in conflict with a later press release regarding patient privacy.

Hi again. 2^(nd) post in a day, sorry if it seems excessive.

I'm presenting the material in the form of a timeline. But before that, allow me to provide some background info:

* **Hospital Authority**, or HA, is a statutory body overlooking all public healthcare services in Hong Kong, including 11 public hospitals.
  * The Accident &amp; Emergency Department Clinical Information System, or **AEIS**, is a computerised patient information log system used at A&amp;E departments.
  * There are police posts in public hospitals, but not private hospitals.
* The Hon. **Dr. Pierre Chan** is one of roughly 70 members of the Legislative Council (**LegCo**), belonging to the ""Medical"" functional constituency.

**Disclaimer**: The following information is taken from the blog of Dr. Chan. You may find the relevant post [here](https://doctordaddysoccer.blogspot.com/2019/06/HA-problem.html?fbclid=IwAR1cN4f_EH59ZoSvUJx5D-TTgwD9zb8mvBIG-Ez6dqYvysUzzxLXkSura2I), in Chinese.

Alright, the main deal

##Timeline - 2019 June

* 9^(th), 1430: A demonstration against a bill amending current extradition laws
* 9^(th), 2300: Government's statement - bill would be put to LegCo on 12^(th) as usual
* 11^(th) night: Anti-amendment protestors occupy streets
* 12^(th), 0900~1000: HA enacts Mass Incident Control Centre (MICC), **[requesting](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mQCjyRdsc0/XQOE0p9OYTI/AAAAAAAAdTk/n5SSD6k6E5QNTVexO8sPXFAtbm5mQShWwCLcBGAs/s640/HA%2Bemail%2BMICC.jpg) A&amp;E doctors to record incidents related to street occupation on the AEIS as follows:**
  * `Incident nature: Mass gathering`
  * `Descripton: Mass gathering at Legco`
* 12^(th), 1500: First wave of physical conflict between protestors and police
  * Police classified clashes as ""riot""
  * Bill meeting at LegCo postponed
* 12^(th) evening: [4 men arrested](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3014356/teacher-prominent-hong-kong-school-among-four-arrested) on suspicion of ""rioting"" at a public hospital (Queen Elizabeth H.) after telling staff of their previous whereabouts
  * 3 were seeking treatment
* 13^(th), 1630: Police press conference **[confirms](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/13/just-restrained-hong-kong-police-say-150-rounds-tears-gas-20-bean-bag-shots-fired-anti-extradition-law-riot/) arrests of citizens seeking and under treatment at a public hospital**, under the justification by ""evidence and reasonable suspicion""
* 14^(th): **HA [press release](https://www.ha.org.hk/haho/ho/pad/252760e.pdf)**. Stances:
  * Patient safety: ""Patient safety during the course of patient management [...] should not be compromised by any non-clinical activities.""
  * Patient confidentiality: ""All patient information are[*sic*] collected on clinical need basis, while observing the need-to-know principles in information access""

---
##Why is Dr. Chan bothered by HA's press release?

1. The arrests made at a public hospital were ""non-clinical activities"" which interfered with the normal procedures of patient management.

2. MICC requested A&amp;E doctors to include the protest in AEIS records of relevant patients, which is not on a ""clinical need basis"".

3. The inactivity of HA over the hospital arrests failed to respond to concerns of medical professionals and citizens over patient confidentiality, deterring citizens from seeking treatment at public hospitals and compromising patient-healthcare relations.
   * Furthermore, Dr. Chan called for a public explanation from HA, not just a press release.

---
##So, why should I care?

Well, as long as you're not working in public hospitals in HK, you don't. I mean, it's not meaningful to ask you about the rights of the police force in hospitals in your jurisdiction - it's probably largely the same around the world.

If you plan to, or are already working at one, this post might be relevant to you.

I have a gut feeling that many doctors ignored the request by MICC on 12/6, but there would probably be more enactments of MICC in the near future. I still cannot make sense of what the HA wants to do, and I agree with Dr. Chan that the HA owes the public and the public healthcare sector a public explanation, lest conspiracy theories surrounding the police and HA get out of hand.",medicine,1560526927,prickatea,2,23,True,2019-06-14

Question from a medical student: How hard is surgery?,"This may sound like a stupid question (it probably is), but how much physical skill is required to become a successful surgeon? How much of operating is God-given physical talent and how much is taught over years of repetition? 

Whenever I ask this question, I always get one of two responses. The first is “I could teach a monkey to physically perform the surgery. The difficulty is learning when and how exactly to operate.” The second response is that surgery requires an enormous amount of skill and that you need to build up your finger dexterity and blah blah.

At What Dollar Amount Should I Be Concerned About A Doctor Receiving Money From Pharmaceutical Companies?,"This probably won't be a popular question, but at what point do you personally think I should start being suspicious that a doctor has been compromised by a pharmaceutical company and may be bias? I understand that most of the time, psychiatrists are just accepting payments for a nice lunch, which seems innocuous - who doesn't want a free lunch?? -- but I think it's common knowledge that after a certain amount of money, it's a safe bet to assume that a doctor wants their weekly free lunch and is willing to meet a certain number of minimum prescriptions (I'm not saying that all psychiatrists get free weekly lunches from pharmaceutical companies, I'm sure that is abnormal, I'm just saying that if a doctor were to get weekly free lunches it may be cause for concern; I also understand that money received from a pharmaceutical company could be for education on a product or for consulting, which I'm fine with and I'm looking at the   breakdowns accordingly). 

i'm using [https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) , i know payments tend to be underreported. I want to get a new doctor and make sure that they are good and moral because my last psychiatrist was very shady and unprofessional -- there aren't many ways to find out if a doctor is ""good"" and since I have many choices and really want the next one to be good, I've been narrowing it down. Every one my list checked off as having been paid less than $250/year by pharmaceutical reps, which I'm happy with, except one doctor who gets paid $1000-$2000 a year by pharmaceuticals, mostly on food. $1000+ is enough to make me personally hesitant even though I know this way below the average.

Rural Africa: Removing Uvulas to Cure Diarrhea,"was living in a Sudanese refugee camp when stumbled across an old man who made a living performing uvulectomies on 4-8 infants every morning. The babies were generally 2-6 months old. Because the uvula looks like a worm, the refugees believed that it dripped down into the stomach and gave the newborns diarrhea. For the next three months I looked down several hundred (adult) throats and did not find a single intact uvula. This tradition is pervasive throughout rural North Africa.

I filmed [the man removing uvulas](https://youtu.be/EztSR1a_2PA) as part of a PBS series. The footage is unusual because foreigners are not allowed inside the refugee camps before 8AM and all of these surgeries happened at around 6AM while it was still cool out. 

I have found almost nothing in the literature about this procedure. I’d be very interested in your comments.

N.B: I filmed a whole series of stories on traditional medicine in Africa – including the local bleeder, burner, butcher-surgeon, etc. I would love to post some of them here – in every case there were aspects that I could not explain – but I don’t want to overstep. Please let me know if this somewhat esoteric topic would be of interest to you.

Dealing with medical mistakes?," Just wrapping up my MS3 year on an IM rotation. 
Had a patient without a history of CKD admitted recently for new heart failure and AKI, now needing dialysis. I did some intense chart sleuthing and found they saw their primary care PA a couple days before admission complaining of worsening ankle and leg swelling, fatigue, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, cough, and lightheadedness. Drew labs at the appointment, including BNP, which was ~1,000. All this was clearly recorded in the PA’s note, but no comment on the BNP.  Patient was taken off their low dose amlodipine due to the LE swelling and started on 200mg metoprolol for their HTN. Few days pass and all symptoms significantly worse, accompanied by new oliguria, and found to have AKI due to ATN. 

This was obvious decompensated heart failure, and Step 1 couldn’t have come up with a more typical presentation. The last thing they needed was a BB. I feel terrible for this patient, and I can’t stop thinking about how all of this could have been prevented. I’m trying to get over it, but I also can’t help feeling a little angry that this patient is suffering for a careless mistake.

I know I’ll make and see many mistakes in the future, so I guess my question is how do you get over mistakes in your own and others’ management? Obviously not as a med student, but do you privately reach out to colleagues who you think may have made a mistake? Also, I know the Step 1 answer to this, but do you always tell the patients? 

As a related question, does it ever get easier to distance yourself from the suffering of your patients? Maybe this situation is just really getting to me, but I’ve caught myself almost feeling bad for enjoying myself when not on duty thinking about “my” patients still in the hospital.

Panama UTI Medicine,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone knows of a UTI medicine used in Panama (could be central America in general but I know for sure they sell this in Panama) that treats UTIs. 

Years ago I had a UTI that wouldn't go away even after I took antibiotics, so my coworker gave me this pill that she swore by from Panama.  (we haven't spoken in years though so asking out of the blue feels strange). 

So, I wanted to see if Reddit would know.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not sure whether I should post this in medicine or altmedicine... I'm pretty sure it wasn't completely Alt, just wasn't sold in the U.S. for various reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah... did I say? That pill cured me almost immediately. It was incredible. I don't know how I let myself forget the name but I haven't had a UTI since. I'm just curious now.

This doctor, with no special training, made the family panic that the patient is almost dead if they do not pay them $1,500 for a treatment. Now, $1,500 bill for a middle-income family in India is A LOT! Patient's family immediately borrowed money on high interest to pay the local doctor. The doctor, having no idea, told the family to bring another $1,500 by tomorrow. The family saw and thought the patient may already have been dead. But in the panic situation, they arranged more money. After 4 to 5 days, the patient was declared dead. Even though the patient was already dead by the first day.

&amp;#x200B;

Another happening that I witnessed was when for a minor leg injury/fracture to a mechanic, a doctor injected something that stopped his leg from functioning permanently.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, more similar things have happened in various areas in India. There are even Indian movies made on how corrupt doctors can be, especially doctors in India. An average Indian citizen is not aware of the law and even when he/she is, the doctors are rich enough to pay off the court. An average citizen does not have enough time and money to take the issue to higher courts. Many doctors know about this, and see it as another higher probability of success in patient exploitation.

&amp;#x200B;

It takes HUGE amount of money, effort, and study to be a doctor anywhere. And especially in India and US. So I do respect doctors a lot. And this post is in now way an attack on an innocent/honest doctor who treats anyone and everyone fairly. Moreover, the loss of money is much less than the loss of a life. But running a drug cartel (the medical drug one), teaming up with testing laboratories to charge a patient 10 times more than the average rate and not accepting reports from non-affiliated laboratories, and charging for operations even when the patient does not require a surgery at all and other major manipulative methods to extract money are a total awful behavior from doctors that can cause any family to attack any corrupt doctor anytime. Especially when they realize their emotions are used to exploit them. The sad thing is, this situation strikes attack on innocent doctors that have been doing their job well.

&amp;#x200B;

I can find countless news articles on patients' families appearing in the news to explain how the doctors exploited their situation to extract money and extend the treatment cycle on a dead patient for days (or months). I've added some readings at the end and would encourage to use your favorite search engine to research further.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not an attack to all the good doctors. But when patients are treated as non-living testing objects, it needs a voice for the poor to reach the deaf-like people in the administration.

&amp;#x200B;

So whose fault it is? It is mostly a fault of the Indian medical association that takes bribe to continue license of a highly corrupt doctor. The doctors currently on strike most likely are affecting lives of innocent citizens that need may need OPD or another urgent treatment. I support the strike, but not necessarily this method that affects an average citizen and not the government.

"Is it true that ""The return on investment for pharma R&amp;D is rapidly shrinking – drug discovery is too expensive to consistently make money anymore.""?","https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/22/the-apa-meeting-a-photo-essay/

How accurate is this? 

""

The return on investment for pharma R&amp;D is rapidly shrinking – drug discovery is too expensive to consistently make money anymore.

But rather than give up and die, pharma has discovered a new business model:

1. Take an popular older drug

2. Re-invent it, either with a minor change to the delivery mechanism, or by finding a similar molecule that works the same way

3. Call this a new drug, advertise the hell out of it, and sell it for 10x – 100x the price of the older drug

4. Profit!

As long as doctors continue to outsource their thinking to the FDA approval process, in a way even the FDA itself doesn’t endorse, pharma companies will be able to inflate the prices of basic medications by a thousand times just by playing games with the bureaucracy.

Eric Cropp (pharmacist) and Radonda Vaught (nurse),"There is an outpour of support for nurse Radonda Vaught. Majority seems to believe she is not at fault despite ignoring 5 system warnings that she was preparing to administer a paralytic (6 if you count the red vial top that warns that its a paralytic agent). She currently still has her license and is practicing at another location. 

My pharmacist colleague informed me of the Eric Cropp case when we were discussing the Vanderbilt case. Why is the response so much different with Eric Cropp? From my understanding he lost his license, served a suspended 5 year jail sentence for manslaughter, 400 hours of community service, and still cannot get his license back despite traveling the nation and educating people on medication errors. The pharmacy technician who actually mixed the lethal dose was not punished.

I have an immense amount of respect for my pharmacist colleagues and wonder why they do not receive the support we're often gratuitously given.

##(1) Do private hospitals in Hong Kong turn away certain patients?

####Here is where I feel like I need legal advice.

I am not completely sure.

Lawyer Melody Chan [stated](https://hk.thenewslens.com/article/120676) on 13^(th) June that ""private hospitals may not be willing to treat gunshot wounds (私家醫院可能不肯治療槍彈傷口)."" I have yet to find verification on this statement, because it seems to be the only relevant result upon Googling.

##(2) What's the condition of the arrested protestors?

As of [20^(th) night](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/19/hong-kong-police-release-eight-anti-extradition-law-protesters-arrested-unrest-loitering/), 32 have ever been arrested. 5 were charged with ""rioting."" 8 were unconditionally released, their charges of ""loitering"" dropped after insufficient evidence.

Nobody has been formally convicted of their charges.

##(3) When do *public* hospitals contact the police during this kind of mass incident?

####I do not recommend taking this as official guidelines.

According to Dr. Leung's conference, translated and edited from Cantonese to written Chinese by i-Cable:

* Definitely not upon discovering injuries inflicted by tear gas bombs. (在[發現]催淚彈[傷痕]的過程中，不會在這方面報案，一定不會)
* With clinical basis for rubber rounds, because they [*possibly refering to pathogenesis of wounds*] are hard to distinguish, but grey areas still exist for that requirement (但橡膠子彈有時候比較難分[…]當時要看臨牀決定如何，當然有時候是灰色地帶)

Lawyer Melody Chan [stated](https://hk.thenewslens.com/article/120676) on 13^(th) June that ""private hospitals may not be willing to treat gunshot wounds (私家醫院可能不肯治療槍彈傷口)."" I have yet to find verification on this statement, because it seems to be the only relevant result upon Googling.

##(2) What's the condition of the arrested protestors?

As of [20^(th) night](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/19/hong-kong-police-release-eight-anti-extradition-law-protesters-arrested-unrest-loitering/), 32 have ever been arrested. 5 were charged with ""rioting."" 8 were unconditionally released, their charges of ""loitering"" dropped after insufficient evidence.

Nobody has been formally convicted of their charges.

##(3) When do *public* hospitals contact the police during this kind of mass incident?

####I do not recommend taking this as official guidelines.

According to Dr. Leung's conference, translated and edited from Cantonese to written Chinese by i-Cable:

* Definitely not upon discovering injuries inflicted by tear gas bombs. (在[發現]催淚彈[傷痕]的過程中，不會在這方面報案，一定不會)
* With clinical basis for rubber rounds, because they [*possibly refering to clinical presentation of wounds*] are hard to distinguish, but grey areas still exist for that requirement (但橡膠子彈有時候比較難分[…]當時要看臨牀決定如何，當然有時候是灰色地帶)

Honest opinion on Locum companies,"I just started working for a large Locum company and I’m having mixed feelings on it. 

On the one hand, I feel like the scum of the earth for having to be the parasite that calls people that just want to be left alone. My coworkers say we’re one of the good companies but I’m not so sure. 

And the other, I see my coworkers with great relationships with people they have accounts with, and that it’s possible to be successful with hospitals that actually need them.

What’s your true opinion, and should I try to switch jobs sooner rather than later?

Residency underperformance and fellowship aspirations,"I’m about to start fellowship in a couple weeks. All the expected emotions are there: excitement, apprehension, curiosity, fear... except for me also there is this feeling that I need to make some personal adjustments, as well. Though I did really well in medical school (to my own surprise), I know I dogged it a little bit in residency. I didn’t read nearly as much as I could or should have (barely any dedicated reading at all other than UpToDate articles about my patients), I didn’t do any real research (only a couple fake task-working data gathering activities for other people’s projects like many of us do), and I just generally didn’t really apply myself. I know this to be true. I basically just did the work, and though I had a couple moments here and there I basically just cruised along. On my way out the door the other day, one of the junior residents made an offhand comment that I can be really great when I care about something, but pretty lazy when I don’t.  He meant it as a joke, but it resonated with me. 

So I have plans to do better in fellowship. New city, new hospital, new people, and a renewed me. I care about this field, and I want to do right my program, my patients, and most importantly myself. I refuse to finish fellowship (and start independent practice!) feeling this way. 

I’m wondering if anyone feels or has felt similarly, and what plans you’ve made or what experiences you’ve had in pursuit of this goal. Would love to hear some stories!",medicine,1561141270,pH_paCo2_paO2,21,66,True,2019-06-21

I did an internship in a university hospital where every punch biopsy was done with written consent, entirely in a sterile field (including local anesthesia), and always closed with sutures.

On the other hand I heard of GPs that do (documented) verbal consent, no sterile fields (so disinfectant + sterile gloves), and close with steristrips.

I guess I'm wondering with how little effort I can responsibly get away with if I do them in the future.

"Congratulations, new doctors and new graduates!","Although it's not yet the great day of July 1, when the wheel of academia cycles around and everything begins anew, it's the time of year when the newly-minted interns have probably started hitting the wards. Welcome to the big white coat leagues! Keep a granola bar or two in those pockets!

Others are looking at completing residency at the end of the week, which means fellowships, new jobs, and hopefully some well-deserved time off. Next life stage! Maybe a real salary, finally, unless you're in the fellowship boat and have deferred money for endless overqualification.

And for those still in the trenches of training, you at least get to increment the PGY# flair. A change of schedule, at least, and some new rotations. And one year closer to being done!

Other medical professionals, I know much less about your educational calendar, but congratulations to those of you passing milestones as well.

Regardless of where you are and whether you're counting numbered years or sitting pretty post-training, this is a time of year to reflect on where you are and give high-fives all around.",medicine,1561407168,PokeTheVeil,66,737,True,2019-06-24

How to avoid knee replacement surgery?,"  

![img](wnn822dwbh631 ""Mahi Clinic"")

Knee replacement surgeries are on the rise, with each passing year.

But can a Replacement of something natural in a Human body be sufficient enough?

Absolutely not. All the invasive procedures are opted as last resort after trying out all Medical and Prophylactic management therapies, as every surgery consists of some risk factors and recovery hazards.

Though [knee replacement surgery](http://mahiclinic.com/) has become a routine procedure and has very less chances of failure or risks, it still has to be noted that it is a procedure that has to be considered as a final option.

Whenever there is any abnormality prevailing in any joint, a battery of tests has to be carried out, in order to arrive at a diagnosis.

Many diseases like Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis are manageable and reversible as well through physiotherapy and drug therapies.

But some diseases, or injuries which are irreversible and ought to cause a lot of discomfort or pain in the patient’s life, fit in the criteria to proceed for a surgery, that to after weighing out all the non-invasive therapy.

**Due to this, it is very important to be aware of how to avoid a replacement surgery.**

**1. Early Diagnosis and Treatment.**

Firstly, in case of a pathological condition, disease has to be diagnosed at an early and treatable stage, for which it is very important to consult a doctor at the earliest.

Doing this, not only the disease can be arrested but can also be reversed by appropriate therapeutic management that the doctor advises, depending on the type of the disease.

**2. Exercise**

Proper regular Exercise and maintaining optimal weight can reduce the joint overload and prevents it from damage. So, an obese patient is at a higher risk of arthropathies and should focus on maintaining diet and weight.

**3. A Knee Brace**

A Knee brace can help people with osteoarthritis, reduce the overload on the affected knee joint by wearing a knee brace that shifts the weight on the unaffected side. This reduce the weight over the affected knee, hence preventing further damage.

**4.Medication and Physiotherapy**

Medications can be taken to reduce knee pain. Analgesics are available that will manage the pain. Along with the medication it is advisable to undergo physical therapy and exercises.

**5. Intra articular injections**

Science has advanced to a great extent. There are many different types of injections are available which can be tried to control the disease at the early stage of disease.

**A).** **Steroid injection.** It can be used in acute stage of disease and treat synovitis

**B).** Hyaluronic acid injection. The synovial fluid in the joint has a significant amount of hyaluronic acid. Injecting this into the joint helps in reducing the pain at great extent

**C).** **Platelet rich plasma (PRP) .** In this the patient’s own blood is injected into the joint after centrifugation. When normal blood is spinned for 7 to 10 minutes, PRP gets separated and that is injected into the knee. This is showing better results of late.

**D). Adipose tissue injection.** The adipose tissue or after liquidating the fat which has significant mesenchymal cells are very promising in treating the arthritis. This treatment is new and at the nascent stage and showing some great results.",medicine,1561458479,rightusandy,0,1,True,2019-06-25

"Still no hospital contract, moving this week for a job, how screwed are we?","Hello, we are in a curious situation where we’ve gone back and forth on my partners contract with a new hospital and don’t have it in time for our move. Standard stuff. And are now waiting for the contract to come back- only it’s been 5 weeks for this final round. The last few rounds were week to week. 

Catch is, we move tomorrow to the city where this new hospital is (had no choice, our lease was up as her fellowship ended) and we’re getting worried.

The guy in charge of the contract assures my partner it’s coming and legal is just dragging their feet and even referred another new potential employee to her to chat as this new guy was considering the job himself and their department would be small. That was last week.

Her letter of intent is non-binding which has me concerned (the non-binding part was added by my partner, not the hospital)

Anyone else been in this situation? What are our options if we move there and it falls through? We wouldn’t want to stay in that city.

Are doctors are more protected than other professions from AI--by public perception and law?,"It seems machine learning is threatening the lives of ""professionals,"" or at least that is what the public are told by the media. For instance, we are reading stories from Business Insider and other resources that accountants will be displaced soon and only the most successful accountants would survive.

While reading these articles, which may exaggerate what is at stake but are true to some degree, I somehow felt the impression it seems doctors are more protected from the advance of AI than other professions, primarily because of the public perception and the law.

For instance, in the case of lawyers, AIs are helping lawyers not only find past cases but also helping give legal conclusions. And, because of the bad perception of the legal profession by the public, the public seems to like the idea of displacing the legal profession with AI--at least limited to the ""simple"" cases. 

In contrast, the public seems to be more hesitant about displacing the medical profession. But most of the ""simple"" works done by doctors working in the field of internal disease/general medicine seem to perform works that can be more easily displaced by machines or AI. 

Of course, I do not advocate doctors working in surgeries or difficult medical case (as for the accountants and for lawyers working on the difficult case), but it seems some works done by doctors can be and should be displaced by AI (to reduce the cost and easy access to medicine). I have had limited exposure with both lawyers and doctors, but for a simple case, at least the lawyers needed to ask detailed questions about the facts to figure out whether the case fits into the law or not (and even this is being automated). But when I go to the doctors for a simple case, most of the questions I am being asked are simple ""yes"" or ""no"" questions that can be automated easily. ""Have you taken this drug \[x\] recently?""; ""Are you suffering from \[y\] problem?""; ""Are you experiencing \[z\] symptom?""

For those who just want to get a stronger cold medicine or a prescription-required medicine for daily use, it seems an AI can easily displace the role of the doctor. But even for these relatively minor cases, the authority is limited to those holding the medical license and people seem to be completely okay with the idea, maybe because the public perception is doctors have contributed more to the society than lawyers. 

What would be the strongest reason why AI should not displace doctors giving out simple medical advice? The possibility that a patient may lie and a doctor can more securely prevent the patient from lying?

Clinical boundaries re: death of a patient?,"Three years ago, as an oncology volunteer, I got to know my patients quite well. One was particularly fond of long conversations. He enjoyed sharing his life stories and adventures. I volunteered almost everyday, and he, his roommate and I would spend hours sharing stories and jokes and sometimes singing. (It was all completely within the realm of what volunteers do in this program.)

Near the end of my stint, he gave me a handwritten note expressing his best wishes.

Limiting the information I write; but, he worked in an industry that suffered a major accident some years ago. His illness (and ultimate passing) were a delayed result of that accident. The note he gave me was written on a postcard from that industry, and he signed his name alongside the name of his specific company/workplace.

After a few months, I left the volunteer position.

Just recently, I found the card again and google-searched his name (it was impulsive; I understand now this was a HIPAA violation). I learned that he passed away. I was and still am devastated; he was a person with incredible integrity. I feel an impulse to grieve somehow -- I carry his card with me; I visited a memorial for his industry, and wandered around for hours, crying a little and remembering our time.

But I am afraid this is all inappropriate and boundary-crossing. I broke HIPAA by searching his name and learning information I was not entitled to (although.... if he gave me a signed card with his name, and I searched based on that information not information from the hospital, is that still HIPAA-breaking?).

**It also seems really inappropriate to visit the memorial or 'grieve' someone who I had a purely clinical relationship with.**

Am I correct that reading about a former patient online, carrying the card and visiting a memorial are inappropriate? Should I be backing off and/or addressing my own boundary issues with a psychologist to prevent future boundary-crossing?

Or, is it in fact acceptable and normal to 'grieve' a patient in this manner?

One more question: He really wanted me to meet his wife, and her to meet me, because she was so important to him and appeared in all his stories (and apparently enjoyed telling her about his volunteer as well). When she visited, he made a point of introducing us, and we all sat together and shared stories. I assume it would be inappropriate and/or HIPAA-non-compliant to contact his wife, share some memories, and extend my condolences?

I have also been tempted to walk by the company/workplace he signed in his note, just to see what it the place was like that meant so much to him. Would that be wrong as well?

Thank you for any guidance; **please believe that I truly regret any boundaries I have crossed,** and am genuinely trying to learn how to navigate them correctly as I move forwards.",medicine,1557792938,LatterChange2,45,123,True,2019-05-13

Interesting Ethical Dilemma the Other Day,"15 year old male brought in to the Family Clinic by his mom a couple of years ago.

He didn't really want to talk at first so mom started off by informing me that he had blood in the toilet bowl a few times. Mom was leading the conversation and it was her that made him come in and had also driven him.

The boy had had a few brief episodes of bright red rectal bleeding associated with rather bad pain and stinging on defecation over the last week. Inconsistent diet with recent constipation/hard stools. No red flags - no weight loss, no family history of cancer etc. Everything is pointing to an anal fissure/fissures

I performed a physical including an abdominal examination and all was well.

Then I discuss that I am very reassured but we should perform a rectal exam to be 100% sure. I informed him that I would get a nurse chaperone to be present and explained the procedure. The boy adamantly stated that he did not want this. Mom then chimed in that he needs to do it. I agreed with the boy that it was his right to refuse and explained again what the purpose of it was. The mom told him that the doctor wanted to do it and it was important so we can make sure there isn't anything more serious going on. Again the boy said ""No."" I then offered that I could do a quick visual inspection and that I may be able to confirm the fissure. Again this was flatly refused. Mom kept on pushing him to get it done, until eventually he quietly agreed and mom got up and left the room, closing the door behind her.

Once she was gone I asked the boy if he wanted to do it. He was a bit panicked and asked that we not do it, but tell his mom that we did do it to stop her pressuring him.

It took me a good few seconds to decide what to do...",medicine,1557820266,SolarWizard,32,65,True,2019-05-14

Looking for help with work OVD,"Hello all, I posted this in the emergency medicine subreddit too, but it’s not really specialty specific. 

I am an emergency doc, and I have OCD. Specifically I am a complete germaphobe. I have been an attending for 6 years, I have kids, and I still worry all the time about bringing stuff home. I basically keep all my work stuff, phone case, shoes, jacket separate in my garage, have a separate hamper at home for dirty scrubs, and clean my car with lysol wipes when I want to use it for non-work driving. I get into and out of the house using lysol wipes to open doors, etc. Its a problem.


I'm in therapy, not the first time, and this is something I've been working on for a long while. Querying my community was a suggestion from my therapist, I feel a little awkward doing that with my colleagues at work so I am asking you.


My question for you is, how do you deal with this? I watch nurses come out of a C. Diff room and use some purell and then move on with their day. I got pus from an LP last week from an unmasked hall patient I had just pulled into a room while someone went for CT. I see these things and feel like everything is disgusting, an I worry about that getting on my kids, my couch, my bed. I am quite functional at work, and can tolerate these things there, my phobia mostly centers around bringing germs into my home environment.


So I am wondering if you have the same thoughts, how you avoid letting them take over, what you do and don't do to protect yourself and your family.

Encroachment in Primary Care,"This is happening in a Canadian province where I thankfully no longer practice but I worry it will become a national trend. How do we stop the creep? And since this is a multidisciplined subreddit... should we stop the creep?

Quoted from FB:
""A colleague recently pointed out that NPs under the new contracts are getting paid better than the MD equivalent.

Nurse Practitioner (1.0 FTE, pay your own overhead)
Year 1: $235,000 for a minimum panel of 500 ($470 per patient)
Year 3: $245,000 for a minimum panel of 1000 ($245 per patient)

Family Physician (1.0 FTE, pay your own overhead)
Year 1: $250,000 for a minimum panel of 800 ($312.50 per patient)
Year 3: $265,000 for a minimum panel of 1250 ($212 per patient)

So, the current state of matters is:
1. Naturopaths have a legal scope nearly identical to MDs to prescribe drugs, order tests and perform minor surgery (albeit not publically funded but they do sneaky stuff like bill botox through extended health under ""naturopath services"")
2. Midwives get paid more to do maternity care than I do (per patient: $1060.01 for prenatal care, $1,060.01 for labour and delivery, $1,060.01 for postpartum care)
3. Now nurse practitioners who have less training are being paid more than MDs to provide care to patients of lower complexity""",medicine,1557951537,localfamilydoc,193,142,True,2019-05-15

Did you ever have doubts about this profession? Why do you still do it?,"I am a medicine student, currently doing placements/internships/stages/coschap/... whatever you call it, so have started the clinical part of this profession.

I really enjoyed studying the theory and just the general life as a medicine student. However, now I’ve experienced the practical side for a few months, I really don’t have the feeling this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Patients can suck, family/parents can be so annoying, people smell, they’re so selfish and annoyed if they don’t see a doctor within three minutes. They think all doctors do is drink coffee, but often we don’t get a break all day long, maybe quickly stuffing our linch if we’re lucky. Then they come at 4 am to the emergency unit with something they’ve had for a week, or some clinically well kid with 38 degrees fever, because a doctor can’t sleep right? 
And our every day life isn’t the cool things you’ve studied; it’s changing the fluids or blood pressure medication or watching/doing the same shoulder surgery all day. We have to work so many hours, patients demand so much, and all they can talk about sometimes is the one thing you didnt do well or that your pay might be higher if you’re finally out of school at 30 (because the hourly wage of a resident is pathetic)

The ACGME has failed us. Disband it. Let the Government regulate GME.,"It's often said that medicine is one such field that has the privilege of regulating itself. We do this by empowering private ""non-profit"" corporations(ACGME, LCME, ABMS, etc) to monopolize control over deciding the way we can practice. But I'm not convinced that the government would be any worse.

After all, we're talking about an arena(Graduate Medical Education) which is funded mostly -to the tune of over 10 billion dollars annually- by the US government, in the form a massive subsidy to hospitals, to cover the costs of resident training. Why not let the government regulate it, instead of an out-of-touch, unaccountable private corporation like the ACGME? After all, it is the US taxpayer who is footing the bill. There are substantial built-in advantages to government oversight, in the form of accountability and oversight from the legislative and executive branches. Also consider that the Freedom of Information Act guarantees transparency in operations, something absent from a private org like the ACGME.

Why rely on this monopolistic private corporation, which is only minimally accountable to a slew of private stake-holders and practically accountable to none? What has the ACGME done for us? They've failed to meaningfully address resident wellness and well-being in the form of common-sense duty hour restrictions and fair pay standards. The working and pay conditions medical residents are subjected to are antithetical to federal labor law. But the hospital lobby long ago got us written off as an exemption; no over-time pay protections for us.

As many as ten percent of residents are suicidal. What have the grossly over-compensated, out-of-touch executives running the ACGME done for us? I'm tired of watching young physicians take their own lives. Sure, working conditions aren't all of the problem, but they are often a part of it. If this isn't an impetus for change, then I don't know what should be.

GME is a government business. Let them regulate it. Like I said, they could do no worse. The ACGME needs to go.",medicine,1557973957,pilgrimage_,76,37,True,2019-05-15

"Homeopathy is a total fraud, and a cruel way to exploit people who are desperately looking for help.","#Why it doesn't work

Essentially, homeopathy is based on the belief that **like cures like**. In practice, this would mean that different symptoms would be treated using small amounts of substances that in bigger doses would cause them.

I do acknowledge that this ""like cures like"" principle has been scientifically researched, with the name **hormesis**. Because of these studies, it's widely accepted that a small amount of a substance can in some cases have a different effect on a cell than a higher dose. However, we don't know how rare this phenomenon is, and the alternate effect it causes isn't necessarily positive or desired at all. 

Practicioners of homeopathy generalize this very unclear and controversial theory by thinking anything that causes a symptom can cure it in low doses. For example, in 2018, naturopath and homeopathic practicioner Anke Zimmermann gave a 4-year-old boy a remedy containing the saliva of a rabid dog, to treat the boy's supposed anger management issues (which, by the way, are perfectly natural for children that age), aggression and poor sleep, claiming that the solution ""cured"" him. If the remedy actually contained the virus, this woman was literally endangering a child's life for some crazy pseudoscientific experiment, while probably charging the parents a significant sum of money for it.

Additionally, there is another, arguably even bigger problem with homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is produced using a method called ""potentization."" This means mixing 1 part of the desired ingredient with 9 parts of water, then shaking the solution, then mixing 1 part of the mixture with 9 parts of water again, and repeating this process over and over again. Homeopaths claim that the less of the ingredient the final solution contains, the more effective it is. This leads to the ingredients being diluted into nonexistence: in almost all homeopathic remedies, not a single molecule remains of the original ingredient. And even remedies that do have something else than water or alcohol in them only contain a couple of molecules of it: not enough to cause any effect. Again, none of this has been scientifically proven to work, but to be honest, homeopathic ""doctors"" don't seem to care about science anyway.


#Research on homeopathy

Most medical institutions around the world have rejected homeopathy as pseudoscientific nonsense, and rightfully so. In 2015, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council, one of the world's biggest and most respected health institutions, conducted a massive study on homeopathy, with over 1800 different studies systematically analyzing papers and documents related to the topic. They concluded that there was ""no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions.""
The NHMRC had already come to the same conclusion earlier, in 2014, when they found homeopathy to have no effect in treating any of the 68 different health conditions included in the study.
In 2010, BMJ (earlier known as the British Medical Journal) wrote an article proving that complementary medicines, such as homeopathy, are absolutely useless as substitutes for conventional medicine.
Even back in 2002, the British Pharmacological Society debunked homeopathy as completely ineffective.

BPS article 2002:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874503/

These were only a few examples of the overwhelming majority of evidence clearly showing that homeopathy has no real curative powers. It's a fact at this point.

Most of, if not all of the ""evidence"" supporting homeopathy, however, is based on people's personal experiences. The problem with this is that these experiences originate from the subjective viewpoints of people who might be biased towards homeopathy, thinking it cured them for sure, when in reality there are tons of other possible reasons to someone recovering from a health condition. It could have been another treatment that was used alongside homeopathy that did the trick. It could have been a change of lifestyle. It could have simply been time: the human body fights for its health by itself. We all have powerful immune systems designed for keeping us alive and well.
Besides, what about all the people who didn't experience any help from homeopathy? We never see the homeopaths talk about them.

There is only one way homeopathic treatment could possibly help a human win over a disease or health condition: placebo. But it's an effect that applies to literally everything. You could eat a piece of candy, and believing in it enough, it could make you feel less ill. Funnily enough, that's basically what homeopathy is all about.


#Why it's unethical

Homeopathic doctors act like kind-hearted and helpful people, who embrace the idea of ""natural"" medicine as a way of healing for everyone. Some of them, I'm sure, truly believe their own lies. But this empathy is also a way to attract customers. Homeopathy is a big business, and a very greedy one.

These mixtures of water and alcohol are being sold to unsuspecting people as a risk-free, non-invasive cure to a plethora of different diseases/symptoms, usually as a liquid or in the form of small sugar pills. The problem with this is that even though they have no effect whatsoever, they are highly expensive, disguise themselves as real medicine and deceive people who often have chronic, painful, difficult, crippling diseases or conditions that they are desperately looking for relief for. The homeopathic industry not only lies to people and takes their money, it can even worsen public health by discouraging people from seeking help from proven, conventional medicine, guiding them towards homeopathy and other nonsensical alternative treatments instead. This is a true problem.


Lastly, I want to link you to a video about homeopathy made by a brilliant knowledge-spreading Youtube channel that some of you may have heard of: Kurzgesagt (In a nutshell). This video is what made me aware of the many flaws of homeopathy in the first place, and for that I'm endlessly thankful to the creators of it!

"Beta testing an idea for my hospital's ""innovation challenge."" All patients receive one completely FREE, annual visit to the ER for a full work up of anything that concerns them.","My large, urban hospital holds frequent ""Innovation Challenges"" in which staff can pitch ideas to improve care. 

I want to create a program that allows all patients to receive 1 (maybe 2 biannually) totally free visits to the ER for assessment for any condition, and to speak to a provider about any concern. This would take place in the ER, but peripherally in maybe a fast track kind of setting, with a MD/PA/NP, RN, and clerk.

The two-part goal, abridged for brevity, is: 
1. Reduce ER overcrowding by diverting patients who frequently seek primary care in the ER, and
2. Proactively identify conditions before they become acute enough to require ER service, thereby reducing healthcare costs to the patient, and further reducing overcrowding.

Essentially the idea is to reimplement doctor housecalls, but instead the house stays put and the patient comes to it.

How does one decide between specialties???,"Ok so I am EXTREMELY torn on what kind of specialty I should pursue. I really love saving lives, but I also enjoy analyzing the inner workings of the body. I also really like professions where you see new and weird things every day, and I despise doing the same procedure all the time; so things like cosmetic plastic surgery or anesthesiology don’t interest me. Obviously those professions do have there moments, and I have no doubt they are enjoyable, but I like high stakes situations, which don’t happen often.

During my high school year is was always the person who would take out every single organ out of the rat, frog, shark, or whatever we were doing, and I’d analyze it just for fun/to search for abnormalities. I thought that maybe I could do forensic pathologist (or just pathology in general), but then I shadowed my grandpa’s friend (my grandpa was a colorectal surgeon) who worked an trauma-orthopaedic surgeon and I was utterly FASCINATED. Like the way this dude would put people back together and save their lives was so amazing and I was just in awe and it was something I became really interested in.

I am aware of dual specialties, but I don’t really know if these would go hand in hand with each other. I think I could do trauma-ortho and also perform autopsies on patients who have died, but I’m also not sure how long I’d be in school if I did. I don’t want to stress myself out too much, as I already suffer from anxiety, but I am still really passionate about this. I also don’t know how my shifts would work. Obviously autopsies/analyses have a more flexible schedule, but trauma-ortho is quite demanding with emergency procedures and being on call. As I said before, I am I college student (going into med school really soon tho) so I could just be over thinking this and it could be not bad at all, or it could be WAY worse. 

Also it is entirely possible that those dual specialties don’t even exist, and I’m going to have to find some sort of other way.  And I’m trying to decide now so I’m not coming to residency like “what the f**k do I wanna do”

[23M] I suspect I have Freidrich's Ataxia. Please help!,"Hi!  I'm a 23 year old male who was just diagnosed with T2D in January and now judging from my other symptoms I have been developing since 2 months and doing some research on Google, I suspect I have Freidrich's Ataxia.  Below are a list of my symptoms:
- Diagnosed with T2D in January.  Even though, my cholesterol, triglycerides were all fine.  I never ate much carbs and sugar anyway.  I am thin (height: 1.8m, normal weight: 71kgs but came down to 60kgs in the 12 months up to being diagnosed as diabetes).
- Since 2 months, I have been getting tachycardia and heart palpitations all the time - went to ER, did ECG and blood work and everything was fine.
- I have been muscle spasms and convulsions.
- I know I have gait walking problems and I have been aware of this since I was around 15 years old.  Recently it became worse so I freaked out and went to a chiropodist and discovered that I have leg length differences.
- I am near sighted and changed my lenses in January - though that was just before my diabetes diagnosis.  But, after 3 months, I discovered I have much worse blurred vision and was seeing double as well.  I just got my lenses changed again some days ago.  The optometrist checked if I have retinopathy, glaucoma and everything else and she didn't find anything.  Though something weird stood out: she was confused to see that my left eye was much weaker than my right eye - though I was seeing better with my left eye!
- I found online that Freidrich's Ataxia occurs in European and Indian population as this condition originated from a shared ancestor.  Some years ago, I did some genetic ancestry tests.  I'm of Indian (state of Bihar) descent and according to that test, my Y-DNA is R1a - that same Gene and autosomally, I share 47% of my genes with that common ancestor (Yamanaya).

Thing is I'm uninsured Currently and have already spent close to $5000 going to ER, chiropodist, getting eyes examined, glasses changed.  I currently don't have that much money and will only get health insurance coverage at the end of July.  So, I don't really know what to do.  Help please!  I guess it's useless to go to a walk in clinic as Freidrich's Ataxia is such a rare disease that I doubt any of the doctors there will know anything about it.

Thing is those symptoms don't really affect me that much, though sometimes I feel I'm judged at my new job I just started a few days ago for my eccentric weird behavior (which is those symptoms).

Anyone else envious of their non-medical school friends or think about entering the workforce instead of the long medicine journey?,"Long term lurker on reddit, don't usually post/comment, but I do very much enjoy reading various subreddits from time to time. This sub here, I like to think represents some fairly intelligent people and would probably be the best for advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: finished my first year of medical school about a week ago, entered medical school right after completing my undergrad in a non science major (think CS, engineering, math etc), and spending summer doing medical research.

&amp;#x200B;

Something that's been bugging me all year is the how long the journey in medicine to become licensed really is. I would attribute a lot of this uncomfort to **A**. not doing enough research in undergrad into how residencies are structured in terms of their length, the match, and the political beuracy (i.e. residencies are a fixed 4/5/6 years in length, when in fact, I would argue that skill should dictate promotion, not a fixed length; this leads me to believe residents are used for cheap labour or that attendings are just stick in ""tradition""). 

**B**. watching my friends finish undergrad along side with me but then going onto get careers in software development, working as engineers for apple or exxon, consulting, doing other very prestigious and well paying careers. It sucks having to study all week and weekend long while getting snapchats of friends going out to do various activities on weekends and nights, travelling for extended periods of time, having the disposable income their 6figure salaries provide. What makes it even worse is that these are the same people I sat beside in undergrad for four years, I could have the very thing they do. The delayed gratification thing is really hurting, knowing that I dont have to go through it, having that ""out"". I keep wondering about how life would have been in the career my undergrad would have delivered. i do not want to seem pretentious or better than anyone else here because I really am not, but most of my peers just do not understand this because they did the typical bio/physiology undergrad for the sole reason of getting into medical school. They could never see themselves as working a career that their degree affords such as research, a phd, masters, teaching; they only sought out medical school, so they dont understand the career and life outside of medicine. Those who did do something different, seemed to despise their time in accounting, engineering etc and that lead to the career switch. I on the other hand, very much enjoyed my undergrad and miss it to an extent.  

&amp;#x200B;

I get what the common counter arguments are: they're not only travelling/partying/hobbies, they're working very stressful jobs. Or they aren't all making 6figures, the hustle of working gets boring, fighting for job security in engineering/consulting, boring jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the reality is, I and almost everyone on this sub could have that 6figure job out of undergrad (because if you can get into medicine, you can sure succeed at most other careers). I agree they maybe working 60+ (or 80+ in the case of my investment banker friends) hours a week, **but are we ever going to avoid that**? I whole heartily expect residency to deal those hours to us for half a decade and to attendings. And lets not forget about all those ortho or general surgeons that have to do 1,2+ fellowships just to secure OR time, having to deal with the politics in medicine, pimping, getting paid below minimum wage at times in residency, worrying about the match. Sure my friends at McKinsey are working 80+ hours a week, but at least they're being well compensated for the time they're spending in the office; I can't say the same for residents.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I  can do a lot of these things like travel, but knowing that Im paying a lot in tuition and time, while my friends are making all this money and getting to live and not going home to study just hurts. I went into medicine because I view doctors as modern day heroes and for the stability of a career in medicine. But lately, seeing towards the end of the tunnel just seems harder and harder. Leaving is just as hard, the golden handcuffs of medicine are tightly wrapped around my wrists and of my peers (those who say money isn't a factor in them coming to medicine are blatant liars, why does it have to be taboo to say medicine is an amazing career financially?). Besides this, a career an attending doctor seems great, I genuinely want to be that person; but I just do not know if it's worth the investment and opportunity cost. Spending my 20s in lecture halls and studying around the clock has lost its allure, I feel like I don't have that motivation that I did in undergrad. I still do well in med school consistently, which is a product of enjoying the material and being a perfectionist. I'd love to be a doctor, practice, and be that hero I look upto. But  the grass seem greener outside of medicine everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

To those who it seems like I am stuck up, an ungrateful POS and not appreciating what I have before me, I am truly sorry that I come off that way. But in all honesty, this has been on my mind for quite a while and it's really hindering me from committing to medicine completely. I really do want to figure out how I want to proceed in life. This last year has been a year of being lost in my thoughts all the time and this decision is really eating me up. If anyone else has gone through this or felt similarly, I'd love to hear what you have to say.",medicine,1558341034,whynotmed,0,1,True,2019-05-20

A Case for MAiD,"Posted from @DavidJuurlink (https://twitter.com/davidjuurlink/status/1129811903776198659?s=21)

“I'd like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.

She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.

/1
She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.

Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.

Sepsis. Fixable enough.

/2
But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.

Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.

/3
A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.

(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)

She underwent stenting and returned home.

/4

Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.

It was now infected, and that was a big problem.

/5

We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.

But then came the big question: “Now what?”

/6
She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that. 

But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.

The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.

/7
We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.
 
Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.

/8
Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.

Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.

/9
She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.

No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.

She wasn’t interested in living like that.

/10
We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.

She wasn’t interested in dying like that.

/11
She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).

/12
We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.

They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.

So that became the plan.

/13
I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.

Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.

/14
After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.

I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.

(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)

/15
A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.

There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.

They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.

/16
I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.

“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.

“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”

/17
She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.

Next came propofol, an anaesthetic.
Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant.
Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.

Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.

/18
There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.

/19
I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.

This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.

/20
We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I'll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.

And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.

Surgery went wrong and no one knows what happened,"TLDR: Pt went in for an emergency Tracheostomy due to neck swelling from a tooth abscess. Pt stopped ventilating AFTER the trach was set up and coded resulting in anoxic brain injury. The cause was bilateral lunch clots in the main stems blocking air flow. Neither the Anesthesiologist or ENT had seen this in 30 years of practice each. 


So I’m going to start off and say the obvious: I’m not a doctor. I’m an SICU nurse with very limited experience. 


Hx: 56yo male had an abscessed tooth removed two weeks ago. He was then admitted to a hospital for IV ABX one week ago for a growing infection in his neck and was released on oral ABX. He was then readmitted to that hospital days later and transferred to my hospital for our ENT doctor. 


Pt was in the SICU with a CC of dyspnea r/t inflammation in the neck and floor of the mouth. When I assessed him he was AOx4, hypertensive (180-240 systolic), clear lung sounds, and pain 10/10 not helped by 4mg morphine q4hr.


3 hours later his lung sounds began to deteriorate. Wheezing started on the left and soon moved bilaterally. 1 hour later, audible stridor was heard. I escalated during all of this and he was assessed by the Hospitalist, Critical Care, Nephro, and ENT. 


We prepped for an emergency Trach and he was sent off. 


The trach was placed without incident with a total blood lost estimate of 25ml. Soon after placement, the pt suddenly stopped ventilating and became bradycardic and went into CA. The ENT and Anesthesiologist eventually found the cause to be blood clots blocking the main stems of the lungs. 


The block clots were lavaged out with one being 4 inches long and significant in diameter. 


24 hours after the incident, the pt has no purposeful movements and sluggish brain activity. He decorticate postures to painful stimulus and we had to paralyze him to remove his tongue from his locked jaw that he regularly grinds or chews. 


The ENT and Anesthesiologist had never seen this in 30 years of practice each and a colleague had seen it once in his career. 


I’m not asking any questions because I don’t know what to ask. It’s an incredibly rare and bizarre situation as I understand it and no one knows where the clots came from that possibly ended this mans life.",medicine,1558533806,RunestoneOfUndoing,53,67,True,2019-05-22

The lab I work at works with animals...,"I’m sorry if this is posted to the wrong sub, let me know if I should post it somewhere else. 

So I just started working at a lab that tests medical devices on animals (following humane GLP standards) and at the end of the study they often need to be euthanized for the purpose of doing a necropsy afterwards. I’m just starting college and this is my first experience with this type of lab. It’s an incredible place to be and they treat the animals with the utmost kindness and humanity, but I’m having a tough time with it. I feel for the animals and it makes me sad to think that these animals that I met and bonded with won’t be living much longer. I know it’s for the greater good, but I just really connect with animals and just am very empathetic towards them. 

I could really use some advice in regards to how to reconcile how I feel. I know it’s for the greater medical good, but I just feel really sad about it and I was hoping someone else might have had a similar experience and could share how they dealt with it. Thank you so much for reading, please let me know if I should post this to a different sub. Thank you. 

tl;dr: my lab has to euthanize animals at the end of a trial and it makes me feel sad for them. Help me to deal with this? Thank you.",medicine,1558667081,janeeyre2019,0,1,True,2019-05-23

Any pediatric neurologists with experience with cerebellitis?,"
I'm a 27-year old female suffering from a case of cerebellitis, which my neurologist tells me usually occurs in children, though some adults can get it.

I have had this three months. I had a headache in February that got progressively worse over a week. One day, I woke up from the headache pain and got dizzy and the room started falling - I couldn't see clearly. It was difficult to walk, which I assumed was because of my poor eyesight. Then I started vomiting. I went to the ER where they said I had vertigo, most likely as the result of BPPV.

I tried doing the Epley maneuever, but it wasn't working, so the next day I went to urgent care, where they referred me to a neurologist. By now, my walking was horrible. I couldn't walk or even stand on my own. I had double vision. The headache and vomiting had stopped, but the walking was horrendous. The neurologist ordered an MRI, and he said that the MRI came back normal - no evidence of stroke or multiple sclerosis. His diagnosis was that I have cerebellitis. I tried corticosteroids for 12 days, but they didn't do much.

My neurologist is now concerned because I haven't recovered 3 months into this. I have made some progress, but I am still not fully there. He says that most people recover in 2-3 weeks and that it's worrisome that I haven't recovered yet. This really frightens me...

I know it's silly, but I found an online support group where some people said that their children had cerebellitis, and their doctors told them to expect it to take months. I know it's silly, and not scientific at all, but it made me wonder if a pediatric neurologist would be a better person to ask about my disease, since most of these cases occur in children after all, and my current neurologist has seen very few of these cases.

Link: https://community.babycenter.com/post/a52159435/post_infectious_cerebellitis

Does anyone here have more experience with childhood neurology issues? Do you have any advice for possible next steps? I am still improving, but it is very slow. My neurologist has recommended physical therapy and IVIG next. Do you know if it would be normal for cerebellitis to take months to heal, or is it concerning that it is taking so long? Is there anything else I can do to speed this up?

"I'm a Missouri resident and medical student, and I wrote a letter to Gov. Parson regarding HB126","""While portions of MO HB126 are encouraging, as a future physician I feel the need to tell you that the frank attack on the medical profession written into this bill, if not overturned, will cause an exodus of practicing and future physicians from Missouri.

""The provision: ""3. It shall be an affirmative defense for any person alleged to have violated the provisions of subsection 2 of this section that the person performed or induced an abortion because of a medical emergency. The defendant shall have the burden of persuasion that the defense is more probably true than not."" Places an impossible task on the physician who performs a medically necessary abortion, because there may be a physician, uninvolved in the case, that could be found by the state as ignorant of the details of the case or spiteful enough of his own profession who could be willing to testify against the decision made by the defendant - regardless of its validity. The state, by placing a physician performing a medically necessary abortion in the category of a felon until proven innocent, places a man or woman, whose holy and moral duty is to the good of their patient, in a legal vice – requiring them to not only make the difficult decision to end a life for the good of another, but also to determine (without legal representation in the moment) if the decision is legally provable as correct. Note the difference between medically correct and legally correct, here. A physician must, prior to performing a necessary and life saving abortion, collect and prepare a case absolving themselves of the decision - as this bill holds them guilty until proven innocent. Not only is this unconstitutional, but is also disrespectful to a profession far older and wiser than the state of Missouri, or even the United States itself.

""While I appreciate the provisions which encourage alternatives to abortions, and would like to encourage your office to continue exploring public policy in that regard, you do not have the authority to place anyone – let alone a physician in the reasonable pursuit of their holy responsibility to the safety of their patient – in the category of a felon, while also placing the burden of proof upon their shoulders.

""I will not practice medicine in Missouri if the aforementioned language is retained and passed into enforceable law, which would damage me greatly because I grew up, have family, and am being trained all within this great state. Missouri needs to protect and encourage physicians so we can continue to minister to and heal your constituents. Language such as this is inexcusable, and I believe the medical community deserves it to be overturned, and an apology.""  


I don't agree with a lot of this bill, but I wanted to focus on this terrible provision. I'm hoping Missouri practicing physicians, other medical professionals, and medical-field students will all join me in making noise about this. We all deserve a presumption of innocence. We haven't devoted our lives to healing others to be rendered a criminal in the pursuit of the good of our patients. If you are willing to help out and write a letter, you can go to this link:

ASA's Response to AANA Document Titled ‘We are the Answer’,"After the AANA released a divisive[statement](https://www.aana.com/docs/default-source/marketing-aana-com-web-documents-(all)/crnas-we-are-the-answer.pdf?sfvrsn=b310d913_4) which generated quite a bit of [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bs8aaf/aanas_statement_on_crna_and_anesthesiologists/) and even excellent [satire](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bsowov/aana_despite_having_much_less_training_crnas_also/), many have eagerly awaited the ASA's response. The first part has arrived this morning from Dr. Linda Mason, President of the ASA via the organization's Monday Morning Outreach:

""I want to thank those of you who alerted us to a document recently released by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) called “CRNAs: We are the Answer.”

I was disappointed to read this malicious statement. However, there is little that’s new here. This is the same recycled, reformatted misinformation the organization has spread for years. We saw it during our campaign to preserve high-quality care in the VA. We saw it in New York last year. We have seen it this year in the seven states where the AANA and its state societies attempted to dismantle existing patient safety standards that ensured patient access to physician-led, team-based models of anesthesia. It didn’t persuade anyone at the VA or in New York or in states like Oklahoma or Arkansas. In each case, physician-delivered and physician-led care was preserved. I commend our members in those states who worked so hard for their patients.

In debate after debate, ASA has successfully responded to the misinformation the AANA foists upon state and federal policymakers. We point out that “nurse anesthesiologist” is a shameless term created to confuse patients. We explain the vast difference in education, skills and training between our medical specialty and nurse anesthetists. We present the fact that the data cited by the AANA to suggest equivalency in care is from brazen, self-funded advocacy studies paid for by the AANA itself. We give policymakers the independent studies that show superior outcomes with the involvement of anesthesiologists. And we are now highlighting that team-based anesthesia is a World Health Organization standard. The AANA and its state societies throw a lot of contempt at our medical specialty. But the good news is that with professionalism and facts, we are winning. And when we win, our patients win.

This AANA document is little more than vitriol. It is about appropriating the name of our medical specialty, disrupting successful team-based models, and ridiculous accusations of “fraud,” “overcompensation” and “barriers.” For ASA and our members, it is all about our patients and what is best for them.

The AANA document simply does not reflect reality. Throughout the country, our members continue to work successfully with nurse anesthetists in a team-based model that frequently also includes anesthesiologist assistants. We are grateful to work with all members of the care team. ASA is committed to preserving and strengthening physician-delivered and physician-led team-based models because that is what is best for our patients. We won’t be distracted from this mission, and I ask that you continue to work with me to preserve our victories and build upon them.

I also want to note that it appears this document is at the center of a larger campaign that the AANA will be unveiling soon. We will have a more detailed response to share with you here and in other member communications as events unfold.

You can read the AANA’s motivation for the document on their website.""

So far, this is a specialty-wide communication, and no ""official statement"" has been made. Of particular concern is the impending ""larger campaign"" from the AANA, and we will have to wait and see exactly what it is. If recent history is any indication, it's unlikely to be anything good.",medicine,1558969308,Undersleep,227,557,True,2019-05-27

"Should hospitals, practitioners handle near-death experiences differently?","Patients come close to death in hospitals, and sometimes they have profound psychological experiences. Some even talk about ""joy... a sense of being separated from one’s body"" and other phenomena while the event is happening. I'm not about to weigh in on the subjective experience, but the psychological effect seems to be profound, and most people who've had an NDE consider it a life-changing event.

There has been more academic interest in NDEs in recent years, and also some rampant quackery. This recent Atlantic article does an OK job at covering some of the questions from a lay perspective, and I've liked the academic work of Bruce Grayson, who looks at some of the neurological causes and effects of NDEs:

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-science-of-near-death-experiences/386231/

I guess my question is this. How do you treat a patient with an NDE? Should there be more sensitivity? A psych visit? 

Really love to hear about personal experiences with patients. Also from medical practitioners who've had an NDE. Most doctor's who've written about NDEs have turned it into kind of a sideshow in my opinion, about ""proof of heaven,"" etc., but I know there must be critical thinkers about it out there as well.

"Torn between Cardiology, Pulm/Critical Care, and General Internal Medicine. Help Me Choose!","I am finishing up my first year of internal medicine and really cannot decide between those 3 specialties. I would love to have your input, advice, and thoughts in this decision. I will tell you about my personal pros and cons of each one. 

&amp;#x200B;

General Internal Medicine - I love that you have a wide breadth of knowledge across everything. I love the patient relationships you can build in the outpatient and even inpatient setting. Additionally, I love that I virtually dictate what I want to do with my life, whether its inpatient vs outpatient vs administrative work vs just the overall ease of dictating your own scheduling. I do not like dealing with all the social dispo nightmares, and I really do not like being the middle man for all the consultants let alone call consultants and have to deal with uptight attitudes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cardiology- I love the heart, I love the coronary system. I love that it's such a prestigious specialty. I love that you're a consultant. I also love that it has both inpatient and outpatient variety and you can build close patient relationships. I also love that you could potentially go into a procedural aspect of it. I do not like the lifestyle it offers. I also do not like the lack of job opportunities (especially in southern California), and I do not like that I will most likely forget everything else in medicine unrelated to cardiology. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pulm/Critical Care- I love hemodynamics, I love the breadth of knowledge you have to know. I love the critical care aspect of it, I love that it is procedural. I love that you pretty much know everything about medicine. I love that there are no stupid social situations (e.g. just downgrade to medicine). I am starting to like pulm more and more. I love the confidence that you feel like you can take care of anything. I do not like that you can not really build relationships with patients.  I also do not like the lifestyle of it and the high burnout rate scares me.

Thoughts on these symptoms?,"Hi guys,

I know this may not be the correct sub, but currently a little paranoid and stressed trying to find an actual diagnosis of what I may have before I make a trip to a doctor.

Symptoms have been going in for the last three days.  Currently experiencing sore eyes, eye and sinus area pain and sometimes pain also in teeth in molar area on the left side of the face when I blink multiple times in a span of a few seconds, stuffed nose but nothing to blow out, headache, tired, and weak.  

The pain in the eyes, sinuses and teeth started off very sharp for the first day, but now is just a regular feeling of moderate pain then goes away immediately.

If anyone knows exactly what I have, it would be much appreciated to hear

We should offer some sort of nursing certification built into primary care residency.,"I think this is warranted anyways with administrations push on off-loading grunt work to residents. Of course, this degree isn't meant to replace nurses or say that we are better nurses than them. But I think it wouldn't hurt especially if some basic requirements for certification were implemented. Maybe some extra lectures/didactics.

It would come with an abbreviation that we can put behind our name (MD/ND).

This probably wouldn't be as applicable to many specialties (with the exception of gas). But I think it would be a nice PR move as well.

Getting the most out of a Doctor's Visit,"Age: 29

Sex: Male

Height: 6’3

Weight: \~210 lbs

Race: Caucasian/middle eastern.

Location: New York

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious the best route to getting the most out of a doctor's visit.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, if I'm visiting a doctor to get a prescription for a shoulder MRI, but I also know my knee needs one, My doctor wants me to make an additional appointment to set up the knee.  In my opinion, there's a fine line between me abusing the doctor's time and him abusing mine for a co-pay.  

&amp;#x200B;

What is the standard here?  Is there an unwritten rule of ""1 Issue per visit"" or is this something open to the doctor's discretion.  I work in the construction industry and it becomes difficult to see a doctor while we're actively building a bridge.

My close friend is a family medicine resident in rural Canada. Their depression/anxiety scores are rising and they are afraid to seek treatment.,"This isn't directly a question of medical advice so much as professional advice so I hope I can post this without it being removed. This probably does break a rule so if I don't find help I at least hope I can be pointed where to look.

Their details: PHQ9 is up to 15-17, GAD7 15. Family Medicine Resident in rural Canada.

They're concerned if they seek any sort of treatment the school will put them on probation and under monthly observation. Being in a rural setting they don't think treatment is possible without the whole community knowing.

They believe the depression to be situational and shouldn't be an issue once the residency concludes. They believe the anxiety is useful in helping them not to miss small details on their work.

I don't know medicine and I don't know if these rationalizations are valid or simply excuses but school probation sounds like quite a threat. Can anyone here help tell me if I should push the subject with them further? Is there a way my friend can get treatment without the negative repercussions?

How do you balance finishing notes/leaving on time/home life?,"Long story short, our first child is almost 3mo old. I’m having the age old dilemma : feeling guilty about not being home if I stay late at work; feeling delinquent if I leave to go home before all charts are closed. I’m full time clinic primary care with night clinic duties 4 times a month. I close 50-90% of my charts that day but on bad days or hard weeks sometimes my charts stack up 4-5 days and results stack up 48 hours.... and I’m left with a choice:

1) stay late to finish notes on time
2) go home, see kid, sacrifice quality of time/precious sleep and try to finish notes at home on time
3) go home, see kid fully, sleep, finish notes in a slightly delinquent fashion (our clinic does not have a rule about timing and many physicians leave charts open for longer than I do).

I will say : all my orders, diagnoses, and almost always my HPIs are fully completed shortly after leaving the room, so others see this even if my ROS/PE/plan justification is not.

Mom who has been a nurse for several years going down a sketchy road,"Hi r/medicine, let me preface this by saying I am a not into medicine myself (set flair to nurse so I could post.) but as this pertains to career/human issues I hope this post can belong here.


       So, my mom who has been a nurse for quite a few years has recently taken a new job at a clinic that appears to be full of misleading quackery, all these non-scientific Panaceas and magical cure-alls that I dont think I can describe any better after my research then bullshit. This clinic provides treatments from high dose vitimin infusions, to ozone autohenotherapy, Chelation, and botox. The practice is run by a MD but most of these treatments appear to be naturopathic. So whatever, there is plenty of controversy about the efficacy of all these treatment methods but my main problem is in her safety, along with the sketchy past of the MD.

       When she started working there she was given all this reading material and documentary style video on why these treatments work (cough cough echo chamber)
Anyways, she immediately bought into all the stories along with the ""extensive background"" of this MD, however after her imploring me in my skepticism along with my own curiosity I explored deep into this rabbit hole and came out even more skeptical then before. Of his multiple professional affiliations, only one seemed to be somewhat credible, that being the American Academy of family Physicians, then all the others full of red flags such as very few member count &gt;300, non peer reviewed journals, and in one case.. not even existing. So after all this long winded background I come to my question, am I digging too deep? Am I the asshole here for trying to do my due diligence that she should have done before taking the position? I struggle to confront her on it because she left her previous job to work here, father supplies enough so it isnt a financial issue. But things like working with ozone, which in my research the medical application it is used for there appears to be not only FDA disapproved but possibly a federal crime! That stuff is highly reactive and dangerous and she didnt even know that until I told her that that stuff will LITERALLY DISSOLVE YOUR LUNGS. So I'm sorry if this was too emotionally charged or long winded. This is just coming from a concerned son who wants the best for his mother. Thank you for your time and any advice on how to approach her or handle this is the best way is appreciated.

"Please listen to us- even if we are nervous, stutter, and not very concise","Its been over 2 weeks now and this is eating away at me. I am too afraid to tell my institution and frankly I don't think they would care much. I thought if I could just have one doctor hear me anonymously maybe I would feel better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a medical student and first I just want to say thank you. You let us bumble our way through 5 minutes long SOAP presentations which would take you guys maybe 30 seconds to say the exact same information in a more concise manner. All of us medical student appreciate the time you take to teach us to be the best doctors we can be.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I was in my neuro clerkship as an M2 and my patient had had a heart attack and anoxic brain injury. It was my job to preround and check on the patient so I did. The note from the ICU doc earlier that day said he had no reflexes, did not initiate breaths on his own,  and recommended compassionate extubation at the hospital they. The ICU doc did the exam with the patient on propofol. I did mine with him not on propofol an hour later and he retracted his limbs from noxious stimuli, had a corneal reflex, and was initiating breathing on his own.   

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to give my presentation to my team but I was instantly cut off by my resident who started to give their own report based off the ICU note they had read earlier. Then the team had a long discussion about how it was better to compassionately extubate at the hospital rather than what the family wanted which was to transport him to a hospital nearer to home so he could pass near his loved ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally interrupted them and blurted out my findings and every just looked at me. Then the attending who I could see was rather annoyed at me asked  why I didn't say that before. Well, I never had a chance to. I couldn't get a word in. I got the feeling they didn't believe me but we all went down and confirmed my findings.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I save or even change this man's life? No. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was not going to get better and in the end he died. But he died at a small local hospital close to home where he could be surrounded by family and friends. He didn't know where he died, he was too far gone. But it mattered to the family and it made a difference to them. The day I did my exam the man's brother  was in the room. It turns out the last time he had seen his brother was a week ago at their sister's funeral. He was saying goodby to both his siblings in the same week. He looked like a ghost asked my to stay with him for a while. I did and he told me about his brother and the good times they had had. He cried for his sister and for the brother he was losing now.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is naive and if this is the wrong sub for this I am really sorry but this but I felt so disheartened by they whole experience.

Nausea/ vomiting?,"As a nursing student, during some of our rotations, I noticed that a lot of people with refactory symptoms such as cancer patients at the end of life or people with persistent illnesses such as cyclic vomiting syndrome receive sedation for symptoms such as pain and vomiting that would not abate and failed to respond to mutiple therapies. 

I understand how sedation can help the pain because you cannot feel pain if you are asleep, but how does it help with nausea/vomiting?

 When I asked about the patient with cyclic vomiting syndrome who was continuously vomiting and wouldn't respond to antiemetics, someone told me that the mechanism that controls vomiting is in your brain and so when you sedate the person its slows/shuts their brain off and therefore stops the vomiting. That makes sense, but at the same time we see that people who go under anesthesia or have had too much to drink and are intoxicated can still vomit in their sleep.

Urethral stenosis following childbirth,"Feel free to delete if this is inappropriate for this sub.... I'm having a hard time finding one that it fits into. r/AskDocs only allows discussion of current issues. I'm interested in the *how* of a past issue. 

After childbirth, I experienced urethral stenosis and couldn't urinate on my own for 10 weeks. At that point, I went in for a cystoscopy, and the dilation fixed it right up. 

This was 10 years ago, so obviously it's not an issue anymore. The thing that really interests me is that I can't find any information whatsoever about urethral stenosis related to childbirth. Everything I find says it's pretty much a male thing. 

I've always wondered what would cause something like that to happen. My best guess would just be trauma? I'm a veterinary technician and have a pretty good grasp of animal medicine and anatomy, but human medicine is a whole different ballgame.

enhancing myopia (near-sightedness) to escape military service,"hey guys, new odd problems from russia :)

&amp;#x200B;

in russia there is compulsory one-year military service. we have list of diseases, and if you have some of them, you may be sent to camp only during martial law, war and so on. one of these diagnosis is high myopia (near-sightedness) – -6.25D and worse. you go to local military office, they examine your eyes, and if you have this high myopia, you’re sent to main hospital in your city to prove the diagnosis. i have -5.5 both eyes, but because of accomodative spasm they’ve measured -6.5 and -6.25. i’m university student so i don’t have to take eye-test in hospital immediately, but in a year it will be mandatory to check my eyes one more time in hospital, as i mentioned earlier.

 

doctors in best hospital in my city (i live in moscow, so these physicians may be one of the best in russia) will definitely find out that i have middle myopia with accomodative spasm, so i have to increase myopia 

&amp;#x200B;

i want to ask you, how can i increase my myopia? there are some methods online like wearing too strong glasses, or reading a lot in darkness etc., but i’m not sure whether these methods are just about increasing accomodative spasm or really help with myopia enhancement.

&amp;#x200B;

plz don’t reply: «woaaaaaaaa u r stupid don’t destroy your health yourself!!!!!!!!!!», because without my glasses i see clearly only at 20-25cm, having one more diopter won’t destroy my life. moreover, because of accomodative spasm i practically have this -6.5 and it is only to be free of army)

&amp;#x200B;

to add some drama: when you approve your bad eyesight you get smth called «millitary id» and after getting this document you can start to cure your deseases. they don’t check if you are still unable to go to camp each year, just give you this id and let you go. i can’t have a laser procedure to cure my eyes right now because after that i will have to become a soldier for a year (ethnic conflicts with your «campmates», bullying me because i’m not gopnic //gogle this term if you don’t know russian culture :P // as usual soldiers are, etc - i definitely don’t wont to become a soldier in russia). so i have to destroy my eyes to get chance to cure them :)",medicine,1555235695,uier2,0,1,True,2019-04-14

North Dakota passes bill allowing PA's to practice independently with at least 4000 supervised experience hours,"Summary of significant changes (from the PA network):

H.B. 1175 makes significant changes to PA practice including:

* Removing the requirement that PAs have a written agreement with a physician if they practice at licensed facilities (e.g., hospitals and nursing homes), facilities with a credentialing and privileging process (clinics), or physician-owned practices;
* Allowing PAs to own their own practice with approval of the North Dakota Board of Medicine;  

   * PA practice owners with less than 4,000 hours of experience must have a collaborating physician;
* Defining PAs scope of practice as determined by their education and training;
* Removing references to physician responsibility for care provided by PAs; and
* Clarifying that PAs are responsible for the care they provide to patients.

&gt; In a clinical study, the rhythm classification by the ECG app of a single lead ECG on Apple Watch was compared to the rhythm classification by a cardiologist of a simultaneously collected 12-lead ECG.

In a fluke call to find a dietician to help with unrelated my weight loss, I found a functional medicine doctor who says he specializes in functional medicine for thyroid disorders.

His credentials all seem real but it all feels a bit off. He trained as a chiropractor but got all these board certifications for neuropathy and func medicine. How much training is in that?

What do you believe is your quantitative impact on the world? Does it keep you up at night?,"I am a prospective physician who will start medical school in a few months. One thing that has always bothered me about this career, though, is the low level of impact that it makes on the world. Medicine in developed countries does not save nearly as many lives as hygiene and nutrition. In addition, there are diminishing marginal returns to medical care, which we see everyday in unnecessary tests and procedures. To make matters worse, doctors are highly replaceable in that if you left medicine, someone else would just step in to take your case. Perhaps they might be a tad less skilled or the patient might have to wait a tad longer, but the end result would be near indistinguishable.

People smarter than me have done the back of the envelope calculations (no one has sat down to get the rigorous numbers because we as a society haven't given anyone the funding to do this). https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/

They calculate that the average doctor saves just 20 lives in their career, which is probably a vast overestimate.

Just working in finance and donating more money to the third world would do more.

Unless you are earning to give, it seems to me that the only moral justification for becoming a physician is to believe that your predominantly white, wealthy and first-world patients' lives are worth more than those of children starving in developing countries. You are shifting the trolley car from killing one person to killing a hundred or more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem

When I talk to physicians, many of whom I admire for being intelligent and strong people, they seem to have a very inflated sense of their direct impact. In fact, they cite ""lives changed"" as one of the most rewarding parts of the job, one that helps them cope with the mindless scut work and moral injury of the profession.

To me, that seems like a convenient fiction. But I am not here just to pontificate, I am wondering what YOU, the physicians and trainees of reddit think.

[Serious] Question about medicare for all,"Hello,

I have a question concerning one of the hotly debated topics in the political realm currently- medicare for all. I watched Bernie Sanders' town hall on Fox recently, and he admitted that such an expansion of medicare would up everyone's taxes. He argues that while we would pay higher taxes, our premiums would be greatly diminished. Makes sense.

I do wonder, though, would younger people be at more of a disadvantage under such a plan? Younger people are generally healthier and (I assume) don't use their insurance as often. I guess I'm wondering would they be paying more for something they aren't using as often as an older person with COPD and a 40 year of smoking history.

Speaking of smoking, would there be any kind of tax breaks for healthier individuals paying into the system? If I'm a non-smoker and normal BMI, would I be paying as much as someone with an obese BMI who actively smokes? I might argue that I shouldn't, considering I'm not as ""risky.""

Did anyone choose a residency based on their Ego?,[removed],medicine,1555511768,7omos_shawarma,0,1,True,2019-04-17
Did anyone choose a residency based on their Ego?,"tl;dr - One of the main reasons i'm considering Trauma surgery as a speciality (compared to the others listed below; GP, Interventional radiology, and Radio-oncology) is my own Ego even with all the negatives...is that healthy?

Hello everybody,

I've been thinking about which residency i'm gonna dive into for some time now, and i'm divided between these few:

\-Trauma Surgery (thus, General surgery first)

\-Interventional Radiology

\- GP

\-Radio-oncology and therapy

I know, how can the difference be so huge between my 4 choices. Well, here comes my question; I have always loved the unexpected cases and patient population of Trauma surgery, as well as the type of Acute surgeries that need to be done that aren't per se repetitive as say, Cardiosurgery. It's a fast, exciting, and full of adrenaline. In general, I'm good under pressure, while on the other hand, I get really bored, very quickly, when i'm on Internal medicine rounds or ANY other type of surgery. Now here's the thing, with all the ""positives"" of Trauma surgery, in my country, the doctor-patient ratio is around 1:800. This is incredibly stunning. I sat down with a head of trauma in one of the hospitals i'm interested in, and basically in a nutshell, 85% of my life will be spent in the hospital which directly contradicts with one other thing that i would like to keep in balance in my life, Family. I can't think of how i will be able to spend 12 hours a day in a hospital, let alone 85% of my time, when i have kids, and even though it is such a big deal to me, i feel that my ego is so strong in this matter (Hard speciality, basically a God of surgery, that more or less saves the day in a disaster...) that it's clouding my judgment to the point where i'm just LOST, in a sense that i'm thinking about all the major things i will be doing as a Trauma surgeon, all the possible research in Trauma, etc.... I dont know what to do, what to think, and how to approach this.

I have done my thesis in interventional radiology and i enjoyed it (minimal patient contact, interventional approaches, multiple things that need to be done, so also not boring), I have also been a month at a GP's office, and also liked how chilled it is, meaning that it is on your own terms, no hospital bullshit, your own office, and your own opening times (plus, they get paid so much in my country). Finally Radio-oncology, similar to Interventional radiology in terms of office exposure (unlike internal medicine or surgery) as well as all the possible future advancements in this field.

In all these 3 specialities, you can open your own practice (money here is also a factor, as in my country, this will lead to a huge increase in earnings) while with Trauma surgery, you are just limited to the hospital, and that is it (so is your salary).

In my country, hospital salaries aren't as high as in the US, so for example, a Trauma surgery, with all the time spent at the hospital, won't make more than $4000-4500 a month. GP on the other hand (Private practice), at least $8000 a month all the way to $15000.

"[meta] Let's talk about subreddit content, midlevels, and moderation.","A few times a year, we meddit moderators like to have a meta thread to discuss general moderation trends, content issues, and to invite feedback from the community about moderation. These threads help us get a feel for what the community enjoys about the subreddit and what they'd like to see change.

It's been a little while since our last one, so I'm sure there's a lot to talk about. Let's start with some stats:

We have eight moderators for this subreddit of 228000 subscribers, a ratio of roughly 1:28,500. In 2019 so far, we've performed a collective 5310 moderation actions, almost exactly 50 moderation actions per day. Being generous and assuming each takes about one minute to read in context, judge, action, and document, that's 50 minutes of moderating required between us in a 24-hour period. March 2019 was our busiest month ever in terms of traffic and moderation and that continues a trend of increasing traffic each month this year.

In terms of content, I think we need to start with the issue of this community's approach to midlevels. I believe that this is a pretty USA-centric problem, and so I'm not bringing much experience to the discussion here, but this has definitely been a recurrent issue on this subreddit.

This subreddit was founded to be a 'lounge' for medical professionals but has standards of civility that effectively amount to ""if you wouldn't say it to a new colleague you're just meeting in the break room, don't say it here"". Since the last meta thread, and probably even before then, we've been seeing a significant increase in [sweeping disparaging remarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bd5ggv/north_dakota_passes_bill_allowing_pas_to_practice/) putting down entire groups of healthcare professionals. This is typically aimed at mid-levels (PAs, NPs, CRNAs, etc) from doctors and medical students. I have been approached privately and [on the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/b66ilq/what_will_keep_the_amas_ama_on_burn_out_from/ejoxsr3/?context=3) by a number of midlevels who feel that this [atmosphere](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bd5ggv/north_dakota_passes_bill_allowing_pas_to_practice/ekwagv0/) makes it very difficult for them to participate in the subreddit and who are increasingly viewing meddit as an unpleasant place to visit.

I don't have the pleasure of being a part of a system where increasing midlevel autonomy is a hot topic or a 'threat', but I think that the tone of this subreddit with respect to these topics has certainly become increasingly toxic. This is, of course, on a background of the subreddit nearly doubling in size over the last year and globally polarised polemic becoming an increasingly common method of default communication. At the moment, we moderators have to balance censorship with civility, and regardless of our approach, we will be upsetting someone. Our steering approach has often been deliberately quite heavy-handed on this professional subreddit but we do recognise that this subreddit exists primarily for the benefit of the users, not the moderators, and to a certain extent we should tailor our moderation strategy around that.

So, that's the main reason this post exists. We'd like to hear your (constructive) thoughts on whether we should be more overt in prohibiting and removing content that is disparaging to midlevels (and where the lines should be, or whether it's best to leave it in our nebulous but hopefully capable hands), or whether the best plan is to trust the community to police itself with upvotes and downvotes alone. It would be really helpful if you could provide links to examples with your posts if possible to help us quantify the problem.

In other news, we are still seeing a fair amount of politics creeping into this subreddit. We've been removing content that is not explicitly and primarily related to the practice of medicine but, as with everything we do that, there are people who feel that we allow too much and those that feel that we censor too much. What's the consensus on that recently in terms of community feeling?

We've been able to run a few AMAs this year and are looking for more. If you're an interesting person (sorry, 99% of you) and want the undying adoration of a quarter million people, get in touch.

Lastly, any and all other suggestions or comments are welcome here. This post will remain stickied for one week and we moderators will try to reply to things on a daily basis. As always, this is a subreddit that relies entirely on international volunteers with full-time day jobs, night jobs, and on-calls to moderate in their spare time and we couldn't make this subreddit work without our moderation team's efforts. If you've got a suggestion - or if you'd like to genuinely offer your help to the team (bearing in mind it can take up about a full hour each week), send us a modmail. If you've got a long history of good posts in meddit, we can even pay you in salt.",medicine,1555518113,Chayoss,666,182,True,2019-04-17

(NEED ADVICE: URGENT AND SERIOUS) STUDYING MEDICINE IN UK OR CANADA,"I am an IB student from the middle east on a gap year with a final IB grade of 44/45.  

International medical program tuition fees in the UK are extremely high (Cardiff’s are the lowest compared to other universities), therefore despite some of the best medical schools being in the UK, I was never planning to study Medicine in the UK as the fees would be extremely high. However, seeing as I was taking a gap year I decided to give the UKCAT with absolutely no preparation just to give it a try and although I didn’t do good, I did get accepted to Cardiff University in Wales. 

My second option is to study at the University of British Columbia in Canada and apply for medicine in Canada after completing my bachelor’s degree. (there is no direct entry to medicine from high school in Canada)

Therefore, I am currently extremely conflicted and am reaching out to you for advice and to ask you which path you would choose if you were in my shoes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Medicine is very important to me and all the decisions I have made in the past years have all been to fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor, and it has been really hard for me to make a decision cause this is not only a matter of my education but also my future as I will have to practice medicine in the country where I have studied it and so choosing a country where I would have a secure future as a foreigner is also a very important factor in my decision making. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cardiff provides direct entry to medicine which will take about 7 years (5years of med school and 2 foundation years), however it will be much harder to acquire UK residency and this could take about 10 years. Also, Cardiff medical school will cost much more than studying medicine in Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

UBC seems to provide a more international environment, and Canada seems to promise a overall more stable future(from what I have heard but please do share your opinions). The world ranking of UBC is also higher than Cardiff University. However, the problem is that getting accepted to medicine is very hard in Canada and I will have to complete my bachelors degree in the next 4 years to apply to medicine and find out if I will or will not be accepted. The path to becoming a doctor in Canada will take about 8 years but acquiring Canadian residency will take about 4-5 years (also I will have to get my PR before applying to med school in order to be able to apply). My biggest fear about choosing this path is not getting accepted to medicine after completing my bachelors degree and having to give up on my dream of a medical career. (and also realizing that I had a chance to study medicine in Cardiff years ago but having given it up)

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: If you are a medical student in the UK, It would also be great if you could tell me how important medical school rankings are in the UK and if it is worth it to spend a few thousand pounds more to study at a top 5 medical school instead of Cardiff. 

P.S: If you have any information about Cardiff medical school I would appreciate it if you could give me some insight into studying medicine in Cardiff, and how Cardiff’s overall ranking and reputation would affect my ability to gain a residency position after medical school (I am asking this as I have heard that the ranking of the school at which you complete you medical degree can affect your ability find a position in top residency opportunities.)",medicine,1555524919,BookOfSpreadingLove,0,1,True,2019-04-17

Let's generate a guide for effective email communication with a busy professional,"We are all drowning in work, and when we get irrelevant, inane, or poorly-written email it really stings.

Help me generate a practical list of actionable tips on ""**How to communicate with a really busy person**"".

Examples on from my own experience are

* **never reply ""thank you"" to an email** - if you are genuinely thankful, send a card. Otherwise, the most sincere thanks is letting their inbox stay empty for an extra 15 minutes
* **send anything that can be answered by the secretary to the secretary** - the administrative assistant knows exactly what the doctor needs to see, and can respond to many questions directly. You will get a faster answer, and the physician won't have to pay your attention tax
* **one issue per email** - since the inbox functions as a defacto ""to do"" list, don't put a long email with four different things you need in a single message ; make each one a message, and make them all succinct
* **make the subject meaningful** - the best email is the one you don't even need to open, because the subject says it all
* **use (NNTR) in the subject** - when you *have* to say something, but also don't need a reply back, put (NNTR) as the very first item in the subject. This tells the recipient that there is **N**o **N**eed **T**o **R**espond, which is an emotional gift when the inbox is full.

All of this could potentially be harmful. He has also voiced concern for ""primary care deserts"" which I understand, but I am still unsure how he will try to address this.

Entering the unknown in emergency situations,"Hi folks,  
I am reading Stephen westaby’s fragile lives about a cardiothoracic surgeon, and one part I wanted to ask about.  


I’ve uploaded the relevant four pages (**out of order**!) to imgur but will summarise (badly) below, [https://imgur.com/a/g6EbXnq](https://imgur.com/a/g6EbXnq?fbclid=IwAR14cRh65d5JSylorjOclc2uKoPFyrwh1Px8ME5pONqPiiWOTBT0Tx-fZOs)  


Here he talks about an unstable patient with a stab wound to the heart which has tamponaded and he was a casualty officer in the ED. There were no ED consultants/cardiothoracic surgeons around at night, so essentially he had to open up the patient there to deal with it with an anaesthetist and nurse.  


I don’t know what a junior doctor casualty officer is (?low grade surgeon or just a senior house officer or what), but I start as a doc in August and while I certainly wouldn’t find myself in this situation I don’t know how to suture let alone what on earth I’d do surgically for this patient.

Why do we s**t on other professions?,"I’m in the healthcare personally for more than six years. I was raised by a mother who was a nurse for something close to 40 years, and one things bothers me to this day… actually almost every day: why a lot of people working in healthcare have a tendency to dismiss other professions and make themselves look better?

Let me explain, starting from the bottom:  

- **CPR instructors:** when I was doing a CPR training the instructors were describing how neither EMTs nor nurses can provide a good CPR and how much they’re better at this.
- **Phlebotomists:** I had an occasion to audit parts of the course as well as encounter phlebotomists both in the field and also drawing me. Due to limited SoP the main point of contention is how nursers are unable to draw, don’t know the order of draw, use too big of a needle etc.
- **EMT-Bs:** I went throughout the program and I currently teach it. I see a tendency of saying how paramedics or (especially) nurses are incompetent and how EMT-B will do a much better job at e.g. CPR or assessment. 
- **EMT-Ps/Paramedics:** Here I could write an essay but in short it’s a daily occurrence to complain at the nursing personnel. I constantly hear how capno, FAST, or intubation are some sort of black magic which paramedics excel at. Additionally there’s a constant finger-pointing about nurses being tethered to a physician with everything while paramedics are free to do almost anything (?!).
- **Nurses:** Here the complains are both downward facing (EMS) and upward facing to PAs and MDs/DOs. I constantly hear how the process of diagnosing patients is so much better while performed by a nurses, since they are able to spend more time with the pt. Additionally the drug dosing and tests results interpretation seems to be the biggest advantage of NPs over PAs/MDs/DOs.
- **PAs:** I don’t have a big exposure to that group, but a number of times (sometimes publicly and/or on social media) I’ve encounter Physician Assistants presenting doctors as money-grabbing machines with just „slightly more wasted years“ (an actual quote).


I deliberately left MDs/DOs out of the list, since the issue there seems to be way more complicated (e.g. fights between specialties, trying to prove that one residency is better than the other etc).  

### Why, just why we s**t into our own bed?!
I just wonder what’s your opinion on that? I personally think this is really inappropriate and simply selfish. Not to mention such behaviors simply look bad in the eyes of patients.  
While I can agree on some points looking at some HCPs most of the time it’s a typical BS IMHO.",medicine,1555810942,kiler129,430,621,True,2019-04-20

Has anyone been really close to signing a contract only to have the offer rescinded because they decided to interview another candidate?,"Had a great feeling about joining a private practice. Spent 3-4 weeks going back and forth about details.  Really like the people and the practice. The only missing piece was precise details about the post-partnership income and ASC buy-in (the details had been vague). My last conversation with them was a bit intense but ended on a good note where the group agreed to share last year's profit and loss statement. 
A week went by with no communication. I messaged them to ask if everyone was still feeling good about moving forward and was reassured that yes they were and the senior partner was on vacation and I'd hear back in a week. Week later I get a phone call from senior partner that while he was gone another candidate reached out to the group and now they no longer had ""clarity"" and that he feels a bit two faced but would call me back in 3 days with an answer and then I basically got ghosted....
At this point I was under the impression that a formal offer had been made to me - a sample contract had been sent and that we were just negotiating and getting information and it was a done deal. Am I over reacting by being really furious at this group who basically led me on for a month? Was I asking too much when I pushed on getting more details about the post partnership income and some statements/concrete evidence of the groups profit/loss before committing to joining. To me it was a huge red flag that no information was being given apart from starting salary and time to partnership and years before I get a return of investment (roughly 2-3 years).",medicine,1555867118,acholic,19,21,True,2019-04-21

I'm really struggling with one of the post-grad exams we've got here in the UK (PACES for anyone wondering) and I'm keen to revise differently from my first two attempts. The exam includes viva style questioning which is something I wasn't subjected to in my med school days.

"I need advice on my medication and psychiatrist, also a bit of a rant (Sorry)","Risperidone is HORRIBLE. I'm currently on 3mgs and I want to get off so bad. A while I ran out of medication and by the time I got back on it was out of my system (terrible withdrawals). I had originally started on 1mg and then increased over time so I asked my psychiatrist if I should do the same and slowly go back to normal, he said it was fine to go straight back to the 3 mg. Those three days were probably the worst of my life.

Firstly it made me feel insanely tired but at the same time have constant heart palpitation every time I moved. I would sleep, then wake up feeling fine, but as soon as I tried to sit up my heart was racing 200 BPM (no joke) I could hear it and feel it in my chest, it feels like I was dying.

All I could do was lay back down and spend 20 minutes waiting until I could go back to sleep. After the first day, I felt better but would still have to spend a good five minutes getting ready to walk to the bathroom (sitting half up then waiting for the dizziness to go away, sit fully up/wait, feet on the ground/wait, bend forward/wait). 

Through all of this and then for a couple of days after I felt the most depressed I have ever felt (and I've been clinically diagnosed before) constant suicidal though, self-harm (scratching), I even practiced suicide notes in my head. I told my mum which meant I was constantly watched (never left home alone) and everyone tried to cheer me up as much as possible. Once it passed I was shocked. 

To be clear this was from one pill, after the first side effects I didn't take the 3mg, instead, I found some old half-finished lower dose pilled and gradually went back on about a week later.

&amp;#x200B;

I really hate this medication and really want to change something.

Every time I talk to my psychiatrist he just blows me off and doesn't seem concerned, even though I have shown multiple side effects such as higher levels of anxiety, terrible headaches (never had before) and hyperprolactinemia. Every time I talk to him about changing medication he says it's the best one for me (I've never tried any other medication or method), and then spends the rest of the session explaining the side effects of risperidone until I'm almost at the point of having a panic attack (doesn't even notice). My symptoms (psychosis) weren't even that bad, I've had it since a child so I managed it well, it was only to stop it progressing. 

I originally went to a psychologist but she said that she wasn't qualified and that I should see a psychiatrist. He was the only one available and now I don't know how to change.

When I went to him I knew I needed help and wanted to discuss some non-medical approaches first, but he didn't even consider any other options and convinced me to take the medicine.  
I'm thinking of talking to my mum about stopping, or going on a lower dose because I have been on it long enough that there is a chance it may have helped permanently

In search of unbiased information on any potential health effects of radio frequency emissions from cell sites,"Hi! I hope this is the right place and format for this sort of post. If not, I understand if it is deleted.


I am an urban planner that processes primarily wireless communication facility projects. 


I am looking to perform an unbiased review of the literature regarding the potential health effects of the radiation emitted from both larger, conventional cell sites and the ""Small Cells"" that are frequently placed on light poles and similar.


This issue frequently blows up during project review and I want to be an informed layperson. Not for the purposes of debate, or even to share at public hearings; just to be informed.


As you may know, in the United States, federal law protects cell sites from being denied based on emissions (provided they meet Federal standards) but I know that other jurisdictions classify RF emissions as potentially carcinogenic.


I want to be clear that I am not looking to confirm any preconceived notions. I am doing my best to remain neutral and get information directly from experts. Because of my job, I do confess a slight bias toward the health effects not being significant if they exist, but I am open to evidence and I want to be up front about this bias in order to demonstrate good faith.


Can you, as subject matter experts, point me to resources that can help me to learn about this issue?


Just to give you my level of knowledge: I know the basics of wavelength, frequency, ionizing vs. non-ionizing radiation, etc. but I am not equipped to dissect dense engineering or medical literature without a bit of training. I can read and learn, though, so link me whatever you can!

Weekly Healthcare News,"Hi everyone,  I've been posting for a while on r/healthcare about the latest major healthcare business, policy, and generally important news from each week. Figured why not give this a shot here, too!

## 1. Healthcare Stocks Get Wrecked

**BEARISH.**

Healthcare is on track to be the [**worst performing sector since 2006**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/health-care-stocks-keep-getting-hammered-wall-street-says-this-is-why-2019-04-17) amidst political drama and [**existential risks**](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/healthcare-stocks-take-150b-beating-over-4-days.html) facing the current system, leaving healthcare investors ([**at least in the public markets**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/private-equity-infuses-healthcare-63b-investment)) skittish. With 2020 approaching and [**Medicare for All**](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/10/sanders-medicare-for-all-plan-1340866) cries rallying, insurance companies like UnitedHealth, Cigna, Anthem, and Humana have suffered through the few months of the year. Providers fared poorly as well – in fact, the S&amp;P Healthcare Services index ([**$XHS**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XHS?p=XHS&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch)) is 15% lower than the S&amp;P 500 as a whole (negative for the year!), which is a massive divergence. Don’t forget about the [**Drug-makers**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBB?p=IBB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch) selloff either. Adding fuel to the fire, UnitedHealth’s CEO’s [**comments on its Q1 conference call**](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/04/16/unitedhealth-group-inc-unh-q1-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx) seemed to indicate a defensive position – warning those on the 80 minute call how any of the proposals floating in Congress or among Democratic candidates would cause “wholesale disruption” of American healthcare, including jeopardizing the relationship people have with their doctors, destabilizing the nation’s healthcare system, limiting clinicians’ abilities to practice medicine at their best, and a severe impact on jobs and the economy. UnitedHealth urged those seeking reform to work within the current system to find the right solutions and correctly align business incentives with patient outcomes.

## 2. High-Deductible Health Plans Linked to Delayed Treatment

**“I’ll wait.”**

That’s what those with high-deductible health plans are saying. To cut down on costs, employers are [**increasingly switching**](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db317.htm) to high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), which could be [**causing delays in care**](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/18/713887452/high-deductible-health-policies-linked-to-delayed-diagnosis-and-treatment) for people who might otherwise seek treatments. HDHPs essentially put the patient on the hook for more of the medical bill, making the patient’s out of pocket healthcare costs higher due to the larger deductible (but generally lower premium). These HDHP plans come packaged with a Health Savings Account (but we all know how good most Americans are at saving money). Based on a Health Affairs study, women who were switched from low-deductible to high-deductible health plans waited months longer on average to seek care for various conditions. This factor did not change when income and geographical area were taken into account, either. The issue boils down to the fact that many patients do not have, or do not want to spend, the money needed to seek preventive treatment for their conditions.

## 3. The Healthcare Cost Blame Game

**Whose fault is it anyway?**

Healthcare players are all [**looking for someone to blame**](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/finance/industry-leaders-share-ideas-point-fingers-limiting-hospital-prices) when it comes to high prices rather than proposing potential solutions, according to ModernHealthcare. Here are just a few of their perspectives from the main healthcare sub-sectors:

**Hospitals.** “Insurers are a problem. If hospitals lowered prices, insurers most likely would not pass along those savings to patients anyway.”

**Insurers.** “Premiums track directly to underlying healthcare costs as calculated by actuaries. We’re not pocketing the extra savings providers generate by cutting costs. Value-based payment models and better integration and collaboration with providers should be the way forward.”

**Big Pharma.** “Hospitals mark up our drugs anyway to make a higher profit. We’ll charge what we want.”

The article outlines a few potential solutions to high hospital prices, including better alignment with payors (value-based care models), giving physicians more responsibility with financial decisions, increasing hospital operational efficiencies and undergoing cost-cutting initiatives, and having employers (as the largest purchasers of insurance) use leverage to negotiate down prices.

## 4. Congress is Considering Raising the Smoking Age to 21

**Tobacco gets smoked.**

The Senate is considering [**raising the smoking age to 21**](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/439501-mcconnell-introducing-bill-to-raise-age-to-buy-tobacco-to-21), which would apply to all tobacco products (yes, even vaping). The federal move comes at a time when several states have already passed laws requiring the minimum age of 21. Interestingly, the large tobacco players actually support the legislation, despite the sell-off in their stocks on the news. Since the FDA is cracking down on youth vaping and tobacco products, Big Tobacco probably thinks this move is likely to keep them in somewhat good graces with the Feds.

## 5. Medical Professionals get Indicted in Opioids Case

**You’re in trouble.**

That’s what the feds are saying to 53 medical professionals. This week, the DOJ [**indicted these professionals**](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/more-than-50-medical-professionals-indicted-in-federal-opioid-cases/552972/), charging them with illegally prescribing and distributing opioids. Apparently, these medical professionals also committed healthcare fraud. The opioids case continues to expand in scope, increasing the number of people charged with the crime of spreading the addictive drugs and perpetuating substance abuse nationwide. Some of the stories detailed in the article are absolutely wild.

"MD v NP, with timeline and experience in mind, in the ED","Hey r/Medicine, long time lurker here searching for some insight.

I'm an RN, and I'm 24.  My goal is to be an ED/critical care travel nurse for a couple years and eventually do flight nursing. I'm a travel addict and adrenaline junkie.

When I initially started school, I was choosing the NP route over MD because I wanted to spend my 20's running around, traveling, being a kid, and not being in school. Then later when I was in my 30s, I could knock out my NP and be in a provider role. Now I'm kicking myself because I don't think NP is the right route. I didn't understand NP schools did not require rigorous study in medicine, or require residency.

So as it stands, if I still pursued a provider role I'd be starting medical school pretty damn late. That's a long commitment to make later in life- much longer than I was planning. However, if I become an ED NP and I'm coming in with years of emergency experience under my belt, am I still falling short? I'd hate to go through medical school, not counting the pre-reqs I'd still have to take, to come out the other side thinking ""I should have just gone to NP school, I would have been in the same position with less debt and less years in school"". But then, I don't want to go through an NP program, feel completely under prepared and under educated, and then push back med school even further. 

So I don't know. I may go through with the provider role and be sick of emergency medicine by then. From what I understand too, if I get my FNP it's easier for me to switch specialties. Maybe burn a few years in an ED and move to primary.

[Discussion] Is there something uniquely bad about health reporting?,"As an embarrassingly basic, upper middle-class, educated, urban liberal, I consume news from the New York Times and NPR in unhealthy amounts. I find their healthcare coverage tends to range from not-great to appallingly bad.

A recent [example](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/health/candida-auris-fungus-chicago.html?login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock) is a case of the so-called ""superbug"" _Candida auris_ at Northwestern University's hospital. In an unfortunate series of events, a women with pulmonary manifestations of worsening SLE ended up on ECMO -- due to uncontrollable bleeding s/p lung biopsy -- as a possible bridge to a lung transplant. After a month-long cannulation, she developed drug-resistant candidemia and died shortly thereafter. The article implies that had she not developed drug-resistant candidemia, she would have been completely fine. It never mentions that the odds of successfully treating even non-resistant candidemia while remaining cannulated were very close to zero, or even if she never developed candidemia, the odds of her getting donor lungs and surviving transplant after a month in an ICU were very close to zero. It also never mentions that people without prolonged immunosuppression and/or long-term indwelling catheters are not at risk for candidemia, whatever the drug resistance profile.

The article spins the whole thing as a lurid and unhelpful story about a cover-up because the state public health department isn't whipping up panic and naming every hospital with an identified case of _C. auris_ (it's every big medical center with complex patients in the ICU). They quote the family as wishing the hospital had told them what they were doing to prevent _C. auris_ before she got it (...?). The involved hospital unsurprisingly declined to comment, and the reporter included only a brief line from a CDC doc saying, ""yep we are seeing some of this"" without tempering any other elements of the story with, I don't know, expert commentary.

Anyway, this is far from the only example. I don't think I've ever heard or read a story in my preferred news sources on healthcare that left me thinking, ""what a good article."" Which got me wondering -- are all the stories on all the topics so distorted, superficial and sensationalized but I just don't know enough about international politics or finance to read the interesting, subtle story amongst the bombast on non-healthcare topics? Or is there something uniquely difficult about reporting on something so personal and emotionally fraught as healthcare? Are there any sources in mainstream news media that tend to do a good job with health reporting?

Childbirth is twice as dangerous for women in America today than it was for their mothers [News],"Hey all! I’m a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women’s health.

We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis– it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That’s even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income.

As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose.

Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

[Discussion] Opinions of Medicaid,"As a future medical student, I have tried to keep up with different public healthcare issues within the nation and my own state. Recently, I have been looking into the benefits of Medicaid expansion for the states that do not currently accept it. From the research that I have done on my own and the classes that I have taken, it seems that healthcare expansion via Medicaid is a no-brainer. I have found that a lot of states that have not accepted the Medicaid expansion and the benefits that come from it have worse ""healthcare rankings"" (see [Health Care Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/health-care) and [states that accept Medicaid](https://www.healthinsurance.org/medicaid/)). Of course there are exceptions and I know that correlation does not equal causation. My question is, in the opinion of the people that are on the front lines with experience, (w/o political bias) is Medicaid a good program with more benefits than drawbacks?",medicine,1556126275,matt_93100,41,0,True,2019-04-24

Quick question regarding CRRT therapy.,"Took care of a very sick patient recently that left me with a lingering question about the optimal course of treatment. To make a long story short, the patient had multiple acute processes, among which was kidney failure. He was placed on CRRT and left in my hands to manage. Over the course of the several days I spent with him, the patient had a very poor tolerance for any fluid removal. At first I could barely remove 50 ml/hr without significantly increased vasopressor requirements, and by the end simply having the machine running caused me to max out on my vasopressor allotment.

My question is this: in the future, should I pursue maximal vasopressor support so a patient will tolerate fluid removal?

In the early few hours when he was only maxed on two pressors I did not aggressively push for additional medication, choosing instead to reduce patient fluid removal. Was this the wrong choice? I would like to know for the future. Thank you for your time.",medicine,1556171100,melonmonkey,16,6,True,2019-04-25

What's the dumbest thing you've done in your training?,"A few examples have come to mind that shock me to this day

&amp;#x200B;

1) I was in a family medicine setting, I was going to vaccinate a 9 month old but didn't put the needle in the syringe correctly. As I injected, half of the vaccine leaked out. The mother started crying (and the baby), and wanted to apologize. The nurses vehemently discouraged me to do that. The staff doc laughed and said ""it happens all the time"".  I still regret not talking to the mom and apologizing. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) On IM , we were individually rounding and was told a patient had a fall that am and was anti-coagulation. I saw them and everything seemed fine. When running the list, the senior said ""she must be on anticoagulation for a while given the senile purpura"". I then realized it was the wrong patient -- mine didn't have any senile purpura. I told my senior in confidence and instead of scolding me said ""good for you to apologize and realizing your mistake. Not many do that. I hope to work with you again sometime"".

A totally weird side effect after a shot! Can the doctors of reddit explain?,"Hello. Yesterday I got 2 shots - one in each arm. One was the HPV shot and one was the meningitis shot. Afterwards, the HPV arm hurt a ton but that quickly went away. The meningitis didn’t hurt when getting it, but I can now barely move my arm without sharp pain.

The weird thing about this is I now have a fever. I am around 101F today and yesterday my temperature was normal. I am a very hygienic person so this was out of the blue.

Another weird thing was I went to my school nurse who took my temperature with this thing that went across my forehead since she believes other thermometers are terrible. She measured me at 97.6 F and when I went home to have my mother check with an ear thermometer and a tounge thermometer, it came up as 101 F.

So two things: why do I have a fever after a shot and is it really bad that my school nurse is measuring a kid with fever as 97.6 F when they really have 101 F? The nurse refuses to admit she is wrong.",medicine,1556220625,evaee00,0,1,True,2019-04-25

Antibiotic stewardship outside of the USA,"I work in a 30ish bed level II trauma center in the Midwest and have always felt that some of our docs are more Gung go about giving abx for what they tell me they think is a viral infection. It's always made me feel a touch annoyed, but I also totally understand the whole I came to the ER, so I better walk away with something attitude that patients come in with. I'm currently in school and would like to practice in a manner that takes abx stewardship into account while still providing compitent care. I grew up in Norway for a few years when I was very young and I remember my mum always commented (with reverence, not disdaine) on how th Norwegians never used antibiotics unless they absolutely had to.

Current med students/PA/NP students: do you receive any sort of formalized training on handling patient expectations against prudent use of abx?

Current practitioners, how do you walk the line between patients expectations and long term effects of overuse of abx? I'm particularly interested in non US medical staff.

"Replacing stethoscope tubing, keeping the binuarals","I wanted to talk about something I did that I've never seen anyone exactly discuss, using older binaurals (aka metal ear tubes) from a stethoscope in new tubing. I see lots of people replace the tubing, but they tend to keep the third party metal eartips too, which aren't machined the same as OME binuarals. 

My [old tubing](https://i.imgur.com/VrvmQfp.jpg) had become worn and [cracked](https://i.imgur.com/oRkqwuh.jpg). I let the warranty lapse before sending them for refurbishment (doh!) The consensus of online reviews was the plastic replacement tubes were adequate, but the metal binuarals were lacking. Specifically the tips were not designed the same as Littmann tips and didn't fit littmann rubber eartips (or even the ones included) very well. If your eartips are loose you'll definitely notice a difference in sound quality. Here's a side by side of the littmann binuaral and eartip (left) and third party replacement replacement (right). [Binuaral](https://i.imgur.com/hmmfln4.jpg), [eartips](https://i.imgur.com/iDDzTBK.jpg).

If you've ever messed with your stethoscope you've realized those binuarals aren't really supposed to come out, and replacement tubes come with them installed. I decided to see if and how I could replace them. I'd recommend anyone doing this use [nitrate mechanic gloves](https://i.imgur.com/H2E74Gx.jpg) to get a better grip and protect [your fingers](https://i.imgur.com/oj7sE6M.jpg). Also, don't do what I did and cut the [binuaral spring](https://i.imgur.com/RsITg4q.jpg). It'll just end up giving you less to grip, and a dangerous sharp edge to avoid. 

Edging the plastic along the tubing is a slow process, don't rush it. I wish I had photos or video to share of the process, but I didn't think to do so until after everything was said and done. I might do so if I pick up a used cardiology stethoscope I've been eyeing on the cheap to restore. 

The [end product](https://i.imgur.com/ui3kZfB.jpg) allowed me to breath new life into a stethoscope out of warranty, for $45 instead of Littmann's $70. About $25 for the tubing and $20 for the replacement diaphragm and earpieces. It also let me pick from a wide variety of colors. The tubing isn't as thick as Littmann's, but definitely strong enough to withstand the removal and insertion of the binuarals.",medicine,1556311927,D_Greene,15,11,True,2019-04-26

How Would Open Access Impact Doctors?,"Hi,

I'm working on a research on Open Access and would like to ask people in the medical field since I don't have insight about this particular industry.

OA initiatives are basically dictating that it's human right to have full access to research without having to subscribe or pay. Meaning, all the scientific data we have shouldn't be locked behind paywalls in the hands of publishing companies that are making money out of it.

Other than the academic sector of course, I can't think of an industry that's probably more affected by this than Medicine.

I was shocked today to hear that in some medical communities and institutions- doctors have to subscribe in order to have access to medical data if their medical institutions does not grant them free access to databases through their ministries or hospitals/clinics. Some clinics use an app called UpToDate that kind of acts like a repository of medical data that professionals could pull out and access (again must be subscribed to it).

Do you personally have to pay to access medical data in your profession?

Do you experience anything related to this?

Also, how do you see free Open Access having a positive impact on your field? To patients also?

What can we do to reduce nepotism in med school admissions?,"In a recent post on admissions fraud in medicine, people posted over and over again on the nepotism and class bias that have infested med school admissions, especially at elite schools.  

The students I've gotten on rotations in the last few years appear much wealthier than students from 20 years ago.  Almost nobody is from a poor or working class background.  The majority have a relative who is already an MD.  From what others have written, it appears that this is typical.

I'm not trashing these students for their backgrounds.  My recent med students have all been quite bright, hard-working, and personable.  But they've also gotten to their mid-20s without suffering any real adversity or hardship.  And their resumes set a standard that most kids from poorer families aren't going to meet. 

Pre-meds from these professional families have so many legs up on other kids.  Other than helping a few individual kids get into med school, what can we do to increase the number of doctors coming from disadvantaged backgrounds?

(My interest in this is several-fold.  Neither of my parents attended college, and this did not present any barrier to getting into an elite med school 40 years ago.  It saddens me that that's changed.  I serve a few different patient populations, but they're all universally poor and the vast majority have experienced tremendous hardship in their lives.  I've been impressed with my students' academic prowess and eagerness to learn, but significantly less impressed with their bedside manner and especially their ability to relate to my patients.  Often they're trying to be nice, but they wind up being condescending and/or fake.  I don't blame them for this, but it reinforces to me the importance of having more diverse backgrounds among new med students).

Is there a chaos-based theory for the human body processes?,"I'm in the second semester of my Med School, and by now we have learned about many of the common processes that our body goes through every single day, just like some less usual ones, and by that I mean the whole thing about oxygen and nutrients transportation, depolarization of muscle cells, hormone producing and acting, etc...

However, I've always been a physics enthusiast, and I find that most ways teachers teach is by suggesting that all these molecules, ions and electric stimuli just work on their own, like they chose which path to take, as if they had conscience to decide how, where and what to interact with, but as we all know, that isn't true.

Atoms, molecules overall, cells and fluid have no brain and no way to distinguish what should they do, but of course, they do (mostly) everything on a orderly basis and with no complications of major significance, and that baffles me since we don't really get to have an answer as to why this happens in such a predictable pattern.

As an example: The entire protein synthesis is such a magnificent and seemingly perfect process, with close to no errors, and are stimulated by cascades of other proteins produced by other cells, that themselves came from a fetus that grew from an embryo with such specific cells to each part and area with no mistakes in order to form a ""normal human being"", and this happens every day, with perfection most of the times.

&amp;#x200B;

This entire brainstorm made me wonder if there is a theory somewhere out there by some crazy scientist that embraces chaos-theory, and no I don't mean the Chaos Emeralds, but in fact I mean that every single one of the processes of molecule binding, breaking, synthesizing and moving, is just a big product of the chaotic nature of electromagnetic forces in between every single atom in our body, that dictates paths in which they have to move, way in which they have to break, and other atoms on which they have to cling onto using classical chemical processes and nothing more.

&amp;#x200B;

(Question) How do cervical spinal cord injuries affect hemodynamics specifically heart rate and blood pressure?,"I’ve been an RN for 4 years but started working in the MICU around 6 months ago. I’ve learned so much in those 6 months and being in the ICU has made me hungry to broaden my knowledge base as a RN. 

I had a patient last night who had me really thinking hard about what exactly was going on with them. Here’s a short background. I’ve changed some patient info for privacy reasons. 

19 yo admitted for severe sepsis and pneumonia. Has a history of necrotic transverse myelitis as an infant leading to quadriplegia, severe developmental delay, seizures, tracheostomy, and ventilator dependence. No other pertinent medical history. 

The patient’s heart rate would fluctuate between a SVT rhythm in the 160s and NSR in the 70s. BP would also fluctuate as well with their MAPs ranging from the 40s up to 100. The patient’s physical exam was unremarkable. Labs were fairly normal and other diagnostic test were negative. 

My thought process was the patient is septic which would explain his tachycardia and hypotension. The patient’s tachycardia and hypotension did somewhat respond to fluid boluses but not as well as I’d like. However, I couldn’t explain why his HR and BP were fluctuating like they were which leads me back to my original question. 

How do spinal cord injuries affect hemodynamics such as HR and BP?

How to study during PA/Medical School and related fields,"As the title states, I want to know your tips for studying effectively. I am currently in my second year of PA school and still have not mastered the whole study thing. I do decent on exams (usually mid to high B's) but studying takes forever for me. I've tried writing everything out, writing down things I deem important, typing things up and printing them out, and purely going off powerpoints/textbooks. I work my \*ss off and others in my class can just look at it once or twice and do exceedingly well; I know there are people out there that can do that, but what is your experience like? The obvious are put away distractions, take a break every hour, etc. I want to know when you're going through the material do you read every single thing, or do you take pieces out that are more important and not worry about the rest?

Doctors working in public hospitals in Germany are voting about whether to go on strike.,"Source: https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/klinikaerzte-103.html (German)

Rough translated, shortened content: 
&gt;55.000 doctors working in over 500 publically owned hospitals, &gt;represented by their union ""Marburger Bund"", refused an offer &gt;made by the employers negotiators in the ongoing negotiations &gt;about working contracts and conditions (""Tarifverhandlungen"").

&gt;Employers offered a 5,4 % raise in 2 steps over 2.5 years.
&gt;Marburger Bund demanded a 5% raise and new negotiations new &gt;conditions after 1 year, additionally they demanded exact &gt;registration of working time and a time limit on call-, overnight &gt;-and weekend-hours.

&gt;The Marburger Bund called the offer proposed by the employers &gt;""not acceptable"", and ""an attempt to take our self-estem"".

&gt;To force issues, doctors will begin voting whether to go on strike &gt;soon. An emergency service will always be availiable.

&gt;Strikes, while common in other sectors, are rare for doctors.
&gt;It would be the second doctors strike, the first being in 2006.

Almost all doctors up to young attendings in Germany are employed through union-negotiated contracts. 
The doctors union boasts 118.00 members and is Europe´s biggest, recruiting members already in University through cheap or free insurance for its members, workshops and help in law or empoyment issues.

I'm quite thankful for representation and someone who is willing to deal with empoyers, as i dont feel confident negotiating pay andworking condition as a mere resident. 
Also transparency regarding pay of my peers feels nice and hopefully prevents any discrimination.

You can view the current pay grades [in this table](
https://www.marburger-bund.de/sites/default/files/tarifvertraege/2018-08/entgelttabelle-zum-tv-aerztevka.pdf)


The groups represent
I : resident physicians
II: physicians who finished residency and are ""Fachärzte"", specialty doctors
III: ""Oberärzte"", attending physicians
IV: ""leitende Oberärzte"", chief attendings, second to the chief.


The ""Entwicklungsstufen"" are raises after a certain amount of time you practiced in the pay group (I-IV)

More of the same,"Woke up tired. Another night that felt like I didnt sleep. Tried to breathe but my nose was clogged. Must be sick. Not bad enough to stay home. Plus, half the patients on the team are sick with probably the same thing. Cant give it back.

Morning report was fine. Had a good teaching point and the residents liked it. Maybe today will finally be a good day on service this week. None so far.

EMR was slow last night. Reset it, hoped it would help. Even slower this morning. Senior resident called about an admission, need to see the splitter with the resident before rounds, dont want to sabotage the progress we made. If the computer stays slow, I dont think I'll finish my pre-rounds. Need a third coffee. 

Rounds dont start well. All of the likely discharges say they dont want to go home today. One is angry, his spouse even moreso. I talked with all of them at length last night. Not surprised. 

Time to work on the discharges. Headed to the angry ones. Can barely start. We lied. I said 1.5l restriction instead of 2. Almost everyone has a restriction this week. I dont know how to practice because I didnt call the liver doctor. He has a new diagnosis of cirrhosis. No lab abnormalities, has consult as an outpatient. I start to explain the reasons for inpatient consults but I'm just talking over her. And I dont tell them enough of what is happening. They say the resident lied. He mentioned an old hemoglobin, not this AM. She calls him smug. I tell her it's not ok to talk like that to my resident. It has its desired effect. She doesnt pay attention to him anymore. Now it's just me. Patient relations comes in, now she wont talk to us anymore. Probably best. 

Specialists are calling. GI cant change the NJ until tomorrow. It's the patients third admission this week because everyone keeps messing up his tubes or his feeds. Hes exasperated, and now I am too. Fine, we will swap it for his stomach and get a friend in IR to advance it. PT changed their note on the angry patient. Meets inpatient rehab now, doesnt have to go home. Looks even more like we lied. The renal transplant is refusing to leave. His diarrhea is almost resolved. Neph is concerned. But his kidneys are fine. Call ID. They are concerned. But his viral studies are negative and he didnt stool for the studies. Call GI. They never do scopes inpatient. Except now they will later this week. Guess we keep him. Hes now stable for the third day. 

Should see the hospice patients. First one is lying alone. Need to talk to family. Dehydrating. No IV, refuse lines. Refuse treatment. Refuse hospice. No labs, no treatment, no vitals for over 24 hours. Needs to go home to family, but they're hardly around. Still full code. 

Next one. HIV+, colorectal cancer. Dilaudid drip, finally working. Sister is there. Thought he would go home but family cant manage. Yesterday he didnt meet inpatient criteria. I dont think he will last more than two days now. Will keep him here. We discuss life, mortality, guilt, family, pain, health. She cries, then smiles. Easiest patient by far. Never used to be. 


Angry one refuses rehab now, wants to go home but needs a Walker. Lost his, insurance wont pay for another. We give him gift cards to get one. They threaten to sue. 

Went downstairs to sit for a minute. Its after two, haven't had a chance to get a drink or food since the third coffee. Saw our wellness rep. Had a long talk last week about the system. I have to change it, doctors are dropping like flies. I said I was going to start with the policy that is keeping my splitter stuck on the wards. They listened, they had a meeting and agree the policy needs to be changed. I asked for an early dispensation for her. They said no. It has to go through committees first. I told my colleague this. We both laugh weakly. We talk about him not working the wards anymore. This is just one more example why. I tell him I'll do more than change a policy. I'll burn them all down if that's what it takes. Someone needs to. 

They cant do the NJ. The patient is too anxious to do it. A little ativan should help. Nurse paged, new policy states that is procedural sedation, cant do it. Fine. Cancel NJ, give ativan. Set timer for 30 minutes to remind resident to go do it ourselves then. Have to burn that policy too. 

Start to sign notes. Have fridays PA notes from clinic. Have yesterdays inpatient notes since the computer was slow. Today's now too. Have to write my own now from all the family meetings and patient complaints. Go to messages. Up to 70. No show reminders from clinic. Inpatient glucose warnings. Behavioral contracts I need to review. Patient complaints about other doctors. Found one buried about a patient out of meds, needs them today. Glad I didnt miss it. 

Its 530 now. Still haven't finished the note from the angry patient. If I do it quick, I can be home soon. Will need to eat dinner quick to save enough time to have the birthday party for my daughter. Then off to Boy Scouts. After, maybe a beer. Maybe bed. Maybe tomorrow wont be any worse. Maybe.

"Ladies (and Men) of Medicine, how do you deal with patients’ comments about your appearance?","I’m currently a PA student on clinicals and I’m gettin real tired of the comments. Usually it’s the middle-age/old men. Never overtly sexual (except the “subtle” boob glances) but, as an example my patient yesterday told my male preceptor he was “lucky to have such a beautiful woman as a student”. I also get a lot of comments about how young I look from all sorts of patients - leading to lots of “girly” and “little girl” comments. I’ve even been thinking of cutting my hair to look a little older. At first I didn’t really care - I’ve been a bartender and a waitress so it’s nothing I haven’t heard before. But lately it’s every damn day and this morning I even had the thought, “Am I actually good at talking to patients or do they just smile and nod cause I’m pretty?” I’m usually really confident in my clinical skills and so it suddenly hit home how those comments can sink in over time.

How do you deal with this from patients specifically? I know guys go through this too. And I mean any inappropriate comments about your appearance, not just being called attractive. My boyfriend thinks that, since I’m a student, it’s my preceptor’s responsibility to pull the patient aside at the end of the visit and give them a “talking to”.

Not at him but at my luck of having such a disease. So I've been thinking how do I volunteer to medical schools or research centers so more Doctors can be educated on what I have?

This may be a stupid question: Why are benzos not used for harm reduction in patient's with alcohol use disorder?,"Similar to methadone, in my head I feel like I would rather have patients who are ingesting tons of alcohol getting their GABA-kick from benzos. I have never tried a benzo before, but I have heard benzos and alcohol feel very similar. The vast majority of health complications from alcohol use are from the direct toxicity of alcohol (e.g. head/neck/esophageal/stomach cancers, gastritis, liver toxicity, etc), not from the pharmacological action of the molecule (GABA-ergic). Why do we not prescribe benzos to alcoholic patients to encourage them to stop using alcohol? The overall goal would of course be to get patients to not use either, and you could wean down the benzo over time.

Many of the arguments I could come up with (e.g. easier to overdose if you combine with alcohol) also apply to methadone, and methadone is widely accepted in the healthcare community to reduce use of other more harmful opioids. ",medicine,1553016222,SerPounce218,0,1,True,2019-03-19

Reason I'm asking is I got a treatment protocol from a PMR for a pt today with a HNP that involved ultrasounding the SIJ, surrounding musculature, massage, heat + cold, TENS, and avoiding ANY LE strengthening for at least 3 weeks, and teaching pelvic tilts.

HPI of pt: 40's active, (L) HNP with min radicular sxs to (L) anterior groin s/p poor lifting mechanics. (-) red flags for cauda equina, spondy, etc. 4/10 pain during eval, worse 7-8/10 in the past 2 weeks. Pt states pain was increased last Monday insidiously. Basically long story short, I bypassed the ""protocol"" and performed my own PT evaluation and treatment and managed to get him to 1-2/10 pain + pt education, HEP, activity modifications, etc in about an 30-40 mins.

Why do PMRs/MD's think all we do is ultrasound/massage people? (not a rant just wondering what they learn about us in terms of when learning other disciplines)

Asked by my PD to be Chief Resident – will saying “no” destroy my career?,"A bit of context – I’m in my 5th year of a demanding six-year residency program (with likely 2-3 more years of fellowship following that). I’m extremely fortunate that the final area that I want to subspecialize in is in pretty high demand across the country and I’ve had talks with the local group about coming back for a permanent position following the completion of my training. Recently, I’ve been approached by current PD, the nursing staff, attendings and fellow residents to take on the role of chief resident next year. I am really flattered and appreciate the compliment for what it is, but have absolutely no desire, or more accurately, a negative interest in being chief. 

Chief resident positions can vary substantially from program to program and at my University, it is largely administrative, with little to know extra clinical responsibility or opportunities to teach (where my interest lies). It’s also an exorbitant amount of work – so much so that they’ve had to divide it between two residents (out of a total of 12 across the entire residency program) with the current chief spending on average 20 hours a week with his chief duties. His pitch to me about the job was terrifying – all negative points but with the final comment that it could only help my career. 

I find residency demanding and finding balance is a struggle at the best of times – and so taking on a 20 hour part time job seems like the exact worst thing I could do to help find balance. I’ve told this to everyone that has approached me about taking this one and I’ve met a lot of criticism for not wanting to take this on. My PD said I am not doing my part to “support the program.” I haven’t caved yet and so my PD approached one of the other residents in my year to be the primary chief, and while he is willing to do so, his condition is that I help him with it. Now he just had his second kid and is doing extender shifts all the time to support his family. If I feel don’t have the time to be chief, I don’t know how in the hell he is going to do it. So I’m worried that even though he is signing up for it – I’ll be left doing all of the work. The program seems to have issues with the other two residents in my year and won’t consider them for the role. 

With all of the resistance and push-back I’ve received when I’ve voiced these concerns, I’m starting to get in my head that perhaps saying “no” to chief resident will hurt me in the long run? While the attending group I am hoping to work with when all is said and done has been very encouraging, I don’t want to take anything for granted. Finally, any tips of how to politely decline the offer would be much appreciated. 

TLDR: My program wants me to be chief resident next year and I have zero interest. Will saying “no” hurt my chances of getting a job in the long run?",medicine,1553147681,brighteyes789,1,1,True,2019-03-21

"From a medical perspective, would Theranos really have been that revolutionary?","I (like everyone I know) just watched the new documentary on Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, and the whole time I was hoping they would delve a little deeper into her basic concept, that increased access to early blood testing would mean fewer people ""have to say goodbye too soon."" They focused entirely on the technology and engineering, but no one really commented on the medicine.

I'm not at all convinced that more and earlier blood tests would have much health benefit. What would having frequent CBCs and BMPs and other routine bloodwork really be able to do? Diagnose hyperlipidemia or pre-diabetes a little earlier? She focuses on the theoretical ability to catch cancer early, but we don't at this point have blood-based screening tests for most cancers, period. It's a science issue, not an access issue.

Is there a doctor on this flight? My story.,"I am a young doctor, recently graduated. I fly frequently and last week I faced a very scary situation that I would like to share here. My actions helped save a life, I think.

The plane had started moving on runaway and we were just about to take off, when a kid started screaming 3 rows behind me. I assumed he was cranky about flying until suddenly I noticed the flight crew rushing past. She grabbed the child and started shouting, ""Is there a doctor on this flight?"" I stood up reflexively without even thinking( part of me screaming this was a very bad idea) and she immediately dumped the kid in my lap. 

He was about 1 year old, I don't have much experience with such an young age. Actively seizing. Grand mal. Frothing secretions from his mouth. Chest not rising. My mind went perfectly blank for a couple of seconds. This was bad, very bad. In the background I could hear the mother screaming her head off about her baby dying.

Training kicked in fast. A crowd was rapidly building up, someone slapping him, someone else trying to open his mouth. I shouted at everyone to back off and told the air hostess to bring the medical kit and oxygen asap. We created a empty space for him and I put him in recovery position, removing any big objects in vicinity.

Now the problem arose. The air crew had no medical training and did not know the contents of their kit. There was no drug to stop his fits, no anti epileptics, no benzos or any sedative. Nothing to establish i.v. access with or anything I could give nasally or rectally. I had no means to stop his seizure. I briefly asked mother about any recent history of fever, any prior history of fits, any medical problem. Everything was normal so far. This was his first fit apparently. He had eaten 2 hours prior.

By this time they had brought oxygen cylinder and a mask which was useless as he wasn't breathing anyways. I had to take control of his airway as his fits were continuous and I was worried about hypoxia, aspiration and a cardiac arrest. There was nothing to control airway either. There was a neonatal ETT but no laryngoscopes. A small miracle happened and someone brought a AMBU and mask, all adult sizes. They actually had nothing pediatric with them.

I stuffed gauze around the mask and started ventilating with AMBU. They had no suction or monitors either, not even a pulse ox. His had started developing peripheral cyanosis although it could be me imagining things in panic. He thankfully had a good pulse so far. I asked for big roll of gauze and in between ventilation, tried to mope up as much of his secretions as I could. They found a steth in the meanwhile. 

He stopped seizing after 5 mins. He still wasn't breathing. Not responding to pain either. I continued ventilation, trying to avoid hyperventilation, checking pulse intermittently. On auscultation I could tell he had aspirated a bit. I kept on mopping excess secretions. His cyanosis disappeared. After 10-15 mins he started breathing. Chest was rising again. I put mask on him and kept on rubbing his chest to stimulate him. He still hadn't opened his eyes and wasn't responding to painful stimuli.

In the meanwhile, another issue had arrived. This was a flight on way to USA. The cabin crew wanted to take off. The pilot came to speak with me, emphasizing how important it was to start on time as delay would cause a massive financial loss. I told him not to continue, in my professional opinion. I couldn't release an unconscious kid to them as I was scared of another fit and cardiac arrest. The family involved agreed to let me decide the plan of action.

30 mins after it started, he opened his eyes and started crying. I can't tell how relieved I was to hear that cry. The on ground pediatrician came after 45 mins. They attached monitors and his saturation was 96%. The pediatricrian agreed that my decision to stop the flight was the correct one. They took him in an ambulance to a nearby hospital. I was so scared they would come after me for stopping the flight, so I was very relieved when he agreed with my decision. The family couldn't thank me enough.

I struggle with imposter syndrome a lot. I make mistakes often and I don't know everything. But when I boarded from that flight as we landed eventually, I knew I had helped to save that kid so apparently I am not entirely useless.

Thank you for reading this super long story. I have hid some details for the sake of anonymity. 😊 ",medicine,1553180814,buttercup987,422,2883,True,2019-03-21

Billable Hours,"One of the culprits frequently blamed for burnout in medicine is the amount of work that's done that isn't paid, isn't really medical, and largely isn't recognized. The American model of healthcare is also already bloated and too expensive, so tacking on more costs is probably a non-starter, but after (of course) talking to a lawyer about billable hours, I started thinking about all the things that could at least conceivably change.

For example, for every patient visit, there is also time required for documentation. Sometimes that can be done during the visit, but that often leaves patients dissatisfied because we look at the screen instead of talking to them. Plus, it often can't be finished, leading to the infamous crush of notes to be finished at the end of the day, either at the office/hospital or taken home. What if, instead, time and cost for doing that were built in? Your appointment is X minutes, and you (or your insurance) pays for X+Y minutes, where Y is a reasonable amount of time to write a note? (In reality, I think physicians—and especially companies/organizations employing physicians—would use any extra time to cram in more patients, though.)

Or take calls for prior authorization. Put together all the time on hold, transfers, waiting for someone to make a decision, faxing, and calling back, and it can really add up. If physicians could just bill for that time it would create a perverse incentive to intentionally waste time on useless prior auths that we really had no intention of getting approved. But I do think that having insurance pay for time wasted on prior authorizations that do go through would create a useful incentive for insurance to be reasonably efficient and responsive. (Tracking time would be a little bit difficult, and I worry that it would ratchet up insurance's efforts to deny all meds so they could also deny all prior auth bills.)

Patient phone calls, FMLA/SS(D)I paperwork, coordinating with other doctors, all of these take time. Getting paid might be a fight, but it would also cut down on wastes of our time, which would allow us to care for more patients and maybe make the system work more smoothly.

The insurance pays for wasted time idea is the one I think is most conceivably workable. I'm interested in any thoughts others have, at least for the sake of imagining a better system.",medicine,1553270760,PokeTheVeil,93,237,True,2019-03-22

A rant about Physical Therapy in the hospital.,"I need to rant. Today I saw a patient who came in for general weakness and AKI. She was elderly and blind. During the eval she showed numerous signs of an acute CVA or hemorrhage including L sided weakness, poor trunk control leaning toward the left as well as impaired sensation and decreased ability to follow commands (when asked to raise her left hand she would raise her right) However she was able to state where she was, the date and appeared to be AOx4 but most questions were answered with a simple yes and many were not answered at all.

I spoke to both the resident and nurse about getting stat imaging done. Both ignored my suggestion. This was around 9 am. About 3 hours later the patient had a code rapid. She was found to have an acute hemorrhage on the R Basal Ganglia as well as evidence of a frontal lobe bleed, further imaging is pending. She is now intubated.

For those of you who think PT has no place in the hospital, you are the reason there are less respect and authority given to the profession. This is by no means the only time I've brought something up to a physician, nurse etc and it's led to further findings and most likely saving a patient's life.

Question from a Medical Student: Why is Surgery Such a Toxic Field in the United States?,"Probably a complex answer, but nearly all the surgeons I have worked with are over worked and burned out. It's hard to hold conversations with the surgical residents because they are over worked and burned out. In any other field outside of medicine, such working conditions would lead to law suits and regulations - but it seems this field gets a pass. It seems the field thinks people are meant to just work as machines without emotions or needs and anything outside of work is unnecessary unless it's food or water to keep you going. A patient asked me why it is acceptable that we allow doctors to become so burned out and jaded if they are taking care of people on a regular basis, and I did not have a good answer given the EU has a sub 50 hour work week limit for residents, but it took people dying to get even an 80 hour limit to get considered for US residents.

Anyone have insight on peer to peer success rate with insurance claims?,I'm a pharmacist working for the Feds so my experience with insurance claims/prior auths is lacking.

Scrubs or Professional clothes ?,"I am an attending physician, hospitalist. In my hospital, almost all of the medical specialty docs wear professional clothes and most of the surgical specialty / ER docs wear scrubs. In addition to that, almost anyone else who works in my hospital, is in scrubs. However, all of my colleagues wear professional clothes - you know, pant-shirt, blouse-skirts etc. I do that too, but I like to wear scrubs. Now, my director (leader of the hospitalist program, aka, my boss) is a 40-ish female physician and feels STRONGLY against scrubs. She says that you are not a moonlighter or a resident and shouldn't wear scrubs, and in extreme cases, if you have to, please wear a white coat on top of it. Everytime she sees me wearing scrubs, she shows such genuine surprise and remarks about it. Kind of unnerving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is what I think about scrubs :- 

\- they are super comfortable

\- its a hassle to make sure clothes are clean, ironed and ready, every morning, especially with a 7 am - 7 pm schedule, not to mention the pain to mix and match styles and colors

\- they are super professional for the type of work I do , FFS, I am not wearing a bikini thong while seeing a patient

\- they are issued by the hospital, if it was so wrong, the hospital would just stop issuing scrubs to me 

\- I dont see a point walking into an infection with my $100-200 worth of professional clothes

\- almost ALL other countries, anyone who works in a hospital, is MANDATED to wear scrubs (aka hospital supplied clothes), I dont understand the American obsession of dressing up like a car salesman

\- my job is 100% clinical ( well 20% clinical and 80% computer typing), I dont have ANY managerial or administrative duties and its 100 % inpatient. I am dressing for the job

\- I tried to look up my hospital official policies, but so far, no luck. I guess we are just expected to dress up professionally. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know how to deal with the situation. I have expressed my desire to wear scrubs multiple times, but she just doesnt get it. In the back of my mind, I want to say that unless you tell me I will be fired or disciplined for wearing scrubs, I will continue to wear them, But honestly I would never want it to escalate it to this level. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should i do ?

Should i talk to the director ?

Should I just give up and start dressing up like a car salesman ? 

Is there a middle ground ?

DEA warns of alarming increase of scam calls,"Just wanted to spread the message about an increase in scam calls from DEA impersonators asking for money. We got one of these calls today at our office. They spoof the official DEA phone number and are very aggressive. For most of us, the moment they ask for money, it becomes obvious it's a scam but not everyone is tuned to recognize that. Let your colleagues know.

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9,"This article describes a group of 800 statisticians who are speaking out against the way we describe our negative studies.

""For several generations, researchers have been warned that a statistically non-significant result does not ‘prove’ the null hypothesis (the hypothesis that there is no difference between groups or no effect of a treatment on some measured outcome)...Let’s be clear about what must stop: we should never conclude there is ‘no difference’ or ‘no association’ just because a P value is larger than a threshold such as 0.05 or, equivalently, because a confidence interval includes zero.""

They suggest renaming ""confidence intervals"" as ""compatibility intervals"", and to interpret study results as being compatible with any outcome within these intervals, while noting that the point estimate of the HR is the result which is most compatible with the study outcome.

For example, the SPRINT MIND study ([https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2723256](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2723256)) which reported no association between intensive blood pressure reduction and dementia (HR 0.83, CI 0.67-1.04), but a significant reduction in mild cognitive impairment (HR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95). The hazard ratios and confidence intervals are virtually identical for the two, with the only difference being that mild cognitive impairment was slightly higher powered due to higher case numbers and thus sneaked over the statistical significance line. Despite this, the medical press largely reported it along the lines of ""Intensive BP control reduces mild cognitive impairment but not dementia"" (E.g. [https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l425.full](https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l425.full?fbclid=IwAR0loGY2Gkbk36mN3H58NbxJPgrDMeELUG6Za2a-mrDCkjnBTkkWDwxfenI)).

If we follow these statisticians' advice, we would instead conclude that the effect on dementia could be anything from a 33% reduction to a 4% increase in risk, with a 20% reduction being the most likely outcome. 

I feel this difference in interpretation could be practice-changing in the right context. I also like the idea of paying more attention to the full range of the confidence intervals when we interpret studies, so we're not bamboozled by underpowered studies confidently claiming negative results.

Should we change the way we interpret negative studies?,"A recent article in Nature, ""[Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9)"", discusses a group of 800 statisticians who are speaking out against the way we describe our negative studies.

If we follow these statisticians' advice, we would instead conclude that the effect on dementia could be anything from a 33% reduction to a 4% increase in risk. I can imagine that the different interpretations could be practice-changing. In this example, the usual interpretation could lead to doctors telling patients that BP control has nothing to do with dementia risk, rather than that it probably does reduce dementia risk but the evidence isn't fully clear yet. 

We can see a similiar issue with statins (my favourite!). Articles like [this one from 2016](https://www.mdedge.com/familymedicine/article/173686/mental-health/do-statins-alter-risk-or-progression-dementia) confidently state that statins do not prevent dementia, but this recommendation is based on very broad confidence intervals (95% CI 0.61-1.65). A subsequent larger meta-analysis found that statins [do prevent dementia](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24248-8) with a RR 0.849, 95% CI = 0.787–0.916. These studies appear to conflict, but are in fact completely compatible, as the RR of 0.849 was included within the confidence intervals of the earlier, smaller study. 

These are just some of the examples that I've noticed, but I feel that paying attention to the possibilities within the entire confidence interval may help to reduce our overconfidence in negative results, which in turn may reduce the amount of ""flip-flopping"" we do on important issues.

Dealing with an unexpected death of a patient,"I am a PGY 2 doctor doing a 1 year training position in internal medicine. Finished my intern year 2 months ago.

I had the evening/night shift (3.30 pm to 9 am) sunday-monday. I had 83 patient in my care between 4 different wards. Only doctor in my department at work.

It was a busy night. I was dealing with an obstructive ileus in a patient initially commited with a uti and a few with respiratory problems that were fairly easily managed.

I was called to the patient in question around 11.30 pm (don't really want to go into the specific case details - went over those with two different senior doctors). I examined him, asked for a consult from the appropriate specialty, made a plan and thought nothing more of it. He seemed well enough when speaking to him and his vitals was nothing out of the ordinary for him. 

The nurses called me at 6 am telling me he was found dead in his bed. I had to show up and declare him dead.

I did not see this coming at all. I was totally shocked. I have had people die in my care before, but those times we had either stopped active care or it was not-so-surprising.

He was 77. He had several comorbidities. Still, I was in shock. I wasn't able to keep it together. I called my attending on call, my mother and a friend I knew was on shift at a different hospital, who luckily was having a quiet morning. I made it through the morning conference without crying, even while presenting this patient. But I couldn't hold back the tears afterwards. Talked to another senior colleague for 30 minutes after. Everyone was really nice.

I went to eat and have two beers with some intern colleagues yesterday. Talked it out again. Managed to have a nice evening. But I couldn't get myself to work today. I feel awful. I keep questioning myself - if I could have prevented it somehow - even though my seniors have assured me I did a good job. This was my first truly unexpected death, but surely it wont be my last. I knew it would happen some day, as all of us do.

I am going to go to work tomorrow. And I have an appointment with my psychologist on thursday, but any advice would be appreciated.",medicine,1553609480,millol,68,399,True,2019-03-26
Upcoming AMA Notice - Health Culture and Burnout,"Hi team,

We're happy to announce that we'll be hosting a new AMA this Friday, March 29th! We'll be hosting a specialist team from the Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C with an interest in behaviour change, burnout, and resilience - among other topics.

They have written:
&gt;Starting this month, we’re embarking on a 12-month health journey – rooted in the science of behavior change – with hundreds of busy on-call doctors and clinicians at Children’s National Health System. A grant provided by ideas42, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, will help us talk to our medical team about ways to continue to create and invest in a culture of health at our pediatric health system. We’ll cover a variety of topics, ranging from creating physical spaces of health at work and home, ideas to expedite or alleviate administrative tasks, and tips to harness emotional resilience, which critical care doctors find particularly helpful. We would be happy to share some of these tips and strategies with Medditors — especially medical students, residents, physician assistants, nurses, and doctors. On Friday we invite you to ask us anything!

I know this topic will affect most of us here, and we're fortunate to have them on board to answer your questions. We will sticky their AMA 24 hours in advance to allow questions to be asked, and then they will reply on Friday live. See you there!",medicine,1553611242,Chayoss,0,13,True,2019-03-26

How to tell a junior colleague they were involved in a fatal mistake?,"Please excuse me for being vague with the details. I'm a pgy2 resident doing ward call evenings, nights and weekends, as such I am part of the medical emergency response team.

A septic elderly patient with poor baseline level of health was admitted over the weekend and seen by the post take medical team including by the consultant and an intern. An abnormal blood result that would have been available at that time and should have been treated was not treated and the patients usual medications that exacerbate this problem were continued instead of ceased or withheld. 

When I saw this patient with the medical emergency team this potentially treatable problem had progressed to shock with multiple organ dysfunction. Given this patients very poor baseline health despite treatment at this stage we expected them to die within 24 hrs.

In a way this was not an unexpected outcome for this patient admitted with sepsis and their level of comorbidities, so I am not sure if the team who saw her over the weekend has gotten any feedback on what happened. I don't think anyone will have told the intern, who I work with regularly.

Ramifications of non-functioning computers,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

So lately the computers at work have been malfunctioning.  Our IT people have been struggling to get them working, but it's becoming a problem.  I'm paralyzed without them.  I can't review records.  I can't place orders.  I might as well be trying to practice without electricity.  Oh, sure, there's ""downtime procedures,"" but they're a joke.  We have no paper records and we're not versed in operating without our EMR or at least computers up and running.

An old, crusty physician with whom I work said: ""just keep seeing them, anyways!""  But I disagree.  Without the record, I face increased liability and also, everything runs so slowly that it might as well be stopped.

My contract with my company says that they will maintain the computers.  So I wonder has anyone gone after a hospital for breach-of-contract for failing to maintain the computers or not providing enough resources?

Mandatory wellness sessions that are not protected mean we have to stay at work another hour or more to catch up on the things we were supposed to be doing. You make it worse.

Yoga and dogs are not going to reverse physician burnout. Being proud of yourselves for offering these things does not mean you're doing something meaningful. 

Physician burnout will be helped by addressing the main causes of burnout, which include disempowerment, too much paperwork, too much work, not enough administrative support, etc. 

PowerPoints about how we should build resilience and admonishments not to kill ourselves are demoralizing and insulting. Telling us we need to try to get sleep and exercise when you're deliberately working us 80 hours or more is just plain mean. 

Every single hospital administration led wellness program is created and enacted by people who work about 40 hours a week. Until the administrator shadows a doctor for an entire week straight, their opinion is not worth a tenth of the money spent on fancy banners and pamphlets.  

Dissuade us from the notion that physician suicides are just the cost of doing business. Every business makes a cost-benefit analysis, ie the cost of implementing a safety measure versus the cost of paying out for wrongful death often does not balance in the favor of preventing harm. Quite frankly, the cost of replacing and retraining a few dozen physicians year is a lot less than the system-wide changes required to reduce burnout.

Is my psychiatry dream realistic?,"I'm 17 (a senior in high school) and I've been trying to figure out a career path for a while now. I've recently been trying to figure out how I can combine my passion for spirituality and philosophy with a realistic career path.

I want the salary and work-life balance of a psychiatrist (so that I can provide for a family), but I just want to counsel people and apply spiritual wisdom / psychological knowledge to my work. Ideally I would run a private practice where I could prescribe medication in addition to giving psychotherapy to patients. I'd also like to provide therapy for mentally healthy people as well, who just want someone to talk to but do not need medication. How realistic is this idea for a career path?

&amp;#x200B;

How much is paid to physicians for hospital stays?,"I'm a brand new hospitalist and my group handles the billing, and I haven't really gotten a grasp of how much I get when I actually see patients. I get reports but it is very opaque and confusing, and I haven't had much chance to sit and go over things like this with our billers.

Things I don't really understand are:

&gt; 1) How much do I get for the initial H&amp;P?
&gt; 2) How much do I get for the progress note?
&gt; 3) Does a DC summary generate a different amount than the progress note?
&gt; 4) In an open ICU, how much more do I get for the days the patient is in the ICU?

I know these obviously do not have a single answer because they vary by insurance, medicare, obs/inpatient and complexity level that they are billed at.

Maybe some examples would help:

&gt; A) Patient admitted under inpatient status for acute systolic CHF exacerbation, history of COPD, diabetes. Patient has Medicare
&gt; 
&gt; B) Same patient as above, but they need ICU level of care
&gt; 
&gt; C) Same again, but they have private insurance (Say, blue cross blue shield)

How often do FDA approved drugs end up having long term side effects?,"First time posting here, read the rules and I don't think this violates anything but remove if it does. Thanks.

Background: I have eczema and have considered taking a fairly new biologic known as ""dupilumab""  (or brand name ""dupixent"") for a while. However, my parents are concerned that due to how new the drug is there could be side effects down the road (10 years+ down the road) that can't be tested now. I have tried searching online to see if there have been any FDA approved medical drugs that have ended up having a medium-severe side effect years later that they couldnt originally test for but to no avail.

Question: Have there been any (if yes, many?) FDA approved medical drugs used for medium-long term treatment that ended up having a significang side effect discovered years later that the original drug trials never picked up? Drug trials seem to be able to check side effects up to two years, but due to patients wanting the drug, any side effects discovered after these two years seem to be based on patients using it. Is this true?

Thanks for anyone who can help, as it's been on my mind for over a year now. ",medicine,1549867960,chowder7,1,1,True,2019-02-11

Senate Bill 801 - Time to Educate,"Ok docs and med students.  In the entire US except New Jersey, CRNAs already work independently without anesthesiologists. Even in states not opted out (opt out it billing term only).  I work in all CRNA group in non-opt out state. No Anesthesiologists for 120miles. We Do everything except hearts and heads.  

For this particular case, SB 801 will change the Nurse Practice Act to reflect the reality of CRNA practice in Oklahoma.  the cost of every hospital in Oklahoma employing an Anesthesiologist is unrealistic.   Many, if not most, small hospitals in rural Oklahoma are cash strapped and barely able to stay open as it is. 

I know a guy who is a partner in Duncan Anesthesia Associates.   They are a private all CRNA practice in Southwest Oklahoma.   They provide “comprehensive anesthesia care” for Duncan Regional Hospital.   Since the inception of the hospital, in 1979, there has NEVER been an anesthesiologist affiliated in an capacity with Duncan Regional.  ALL anesthesia care has been provided by CRNAs.  They exceed 6,000 cases in 2018 with the volume growing every year.  
  
If CRNAs were unsafe then how did they and the 1000s of other all crna groups manage to keep their contract with the hospital for the last FORTY years. Because we are SAFE and we do an exceptional job providing “TOP TIER” comprehensive anesthesia services including this group in OK for Duncan Regional Hospital and the patients of Southwest Oklahoma.  

Please, ask me any question. 

I saw a lot about “does this mean CRNAs can be sued now?”  We always have been able to and we do just like anesthesiologists. No difference.

I am not being hostile, just want to clear up any confusion. Especially with med students who want to go in to anesthesiology and hear all of the fear mongering propaganda.  ",medicine,1550012711,pcuser9111,32,1,True,2019-02-12

"Does EXTREME EXCERCISE lower the Suboxone levels found in urine? I am clean of opiates for 2 years, Dr. wants to wrongfully lower dose.","Bupe Question

Does extreme excercise cause the body to detox medications? I am a recovering Heroin addict, for 3 years I have been on buprenorphine, at 3 tablets per day. They are taken sublingually and are taken correctly. I let sit for at least 15 minutes to absorb. Now my new Doctor wrongfully wants to lower my dose amount all of a sudden after I have been on 3 tablets for past 2 years with old doctor that has since retired.
My NEW doctor wants to lower me because he says my urine amount shows a much lower level of bupenorphine than what is prescribed. I have told him I do not know the reason for that but I HAVE been taking medication CORRECTLY and taking ALL medication. I am EXTREMELY active doing 30 minutes of extreme cardio in the morning and an hour of extreme strength training at night. The routine is (P90 X). Is it possible that my urine levels are showing so low because my body naturally detoxes, and filters out my medications because of such excercises? Please, I need a professional opinion other than his. I have done very well for myself since the induction of my addiction recovery treatment back in 2015 and I am at a point in my life where I need stability, I have a great job and life and I am comfortable on 3 tablets a day! Him cutting down my dosage only will make me suffer. At this point I am addicted psychologically and physically to my medication and keeps me off heroin and opioids. I DO plan to quit the Bupenorphine at some point in my life but that will take a slow methodic and deliberate plan of slowly tapering off.

Surgeons -- do you sit during surgery?,"I've had knee injuries and surgeries in the past that make standing for long hours in one position very sore and uncomfortable. I'm interested in going into surgery, but heard a bit about the ""machismo"" in the US where surgeons refuse to sit while performing surgery and that they see residents who take a seat as weak and not worthy of going into the profession.

However, in the hospitals that I've had a chance to observe in (Europe, Asia, South America), I've noticed that surgeons don't seem to share the same attitude. If their operation is long, they'll ask for a stool, or just have one from the very beginning. Is the too-good-to-sit attitude limited to North America? Or to certain specialties?

So a question for the surgeons on meddit -- do you sit? From the very beginning? Or only after a few hours when you get tired? How do you view young trainees that want to sit? And if you could add where you practice that would be great!

The Three Commandments of Consults,"1. Thou shalt know why thou art consulting a service, lest the discussion with the consult become a game of 20 questions.
2. Thou shalt know thy patient, lest you admit that thou hast not seen the imaging or read through the last consultant's note.
3. Thou shalt have done a basic workup to aid in commandment #2.
4. Bonus: Thou shalt not feed a patient if thou hast consulted surgery with requests for an emergent intervention.

I broke 1 and 2 today. We had a patient with PVD who had a new wound. My attending said, ""consult vascular"". I did. The vascular resident (full disclosure: really smart guy who knows me and who I respect) asked \*why\* I was consulting them, i.e., what was I hoping vascular would do. I paused.  A guy with PVD and a wound is as common as an anesthesiologist wearing a Hawaiian shirt on rounds. I knew this wasn't a surgical candidate. Wound care was on board. Why was I calling vascular?  Then the resident asked me how his peripheral pulses were. Lots of stammering on my end. Of course I should have known that.  Big difference between someone who has intact pulses vs. a guy who has no DP even on doppler.

&amp;#x200B;

The actual question was what workup we should do to see how bad this guy's leg was and whether vascular surgery thought we should do anything besides mere wound care, whether he should be followed outpatient, etc. Different question, more specific. 

&amp;#x200B;

The consult resident can get 20+ requests a day. Everyone benefits when we know why we're doing something and have done enough basic legwork to give a concrete answer. As for #4, if you want gen surg to take out a guy's gallbladder, look at the US yourself and don't have him chowing down on a hamburger when we visit.

"Dear POCUS minded Meddit, would you be interested in a subreddit dedicated to uploading and constructively critique POCUS images?","I've created /r/Pocusreview for me and some interested hospitalists/residents to post and critique reviews however on my mission to learn POCUS, I've realized that there is a huge gap for something like this. I'm becoming SHM certified which entails an online portfolio of dozens of images that have to be accepted before I become certified but this costs $1500 and overkill for anyone just getting started. 

&amp;#x200B;

POCUS is a huge new skill for obtaining data that not only tests your skill for finding an image, but also optimizing it enough for proper interpretation and without practice that skill does not really become useful.

Games I play with pediatric patients,"I'm a pediatrician.  Part of what we do is to make our patients relax.  This is also part of the exam, because a smiling, laughing kid is probably not a truly sick kid.  And a ticklish belly is not an acute abdomen.  

* The ear is an undiscovered country.  Here there be lions, tigers and bears, oh my!  I might have forgotten to mention the monkeys.  When I first started, I just counted monkeys.  Over the years, I've started to discover that they play basketball, hopscotch and, parchisi.  They often cook meals, but they never wash their dishes.  A few years ago, I had a patient who had just moved from Australia and wouldn't you know it, there is now an epidemic of kangaroos, koalas, and even crocodiles in ears now.  Another kid moved from Florida and with him came a flamingo and alligator epidemic.  
* I always ask children what they had for breakfast/lunch before I examine their bellies.  Often, they can't seem to remember, so I ask them, ""has your mouth been with you all day today?""  When I do get the answer, I then need to find the various components of their last meal (ticklingly, of course), in great detail.  ""Here's the bun...and over here's the ketchup...and over here's the pickle relish...and the chips are here...and where is the hot dog?  Is it over here?  How about over here?  Oh, heeeere it is!""  Froot Loops are especially fun because you can find an example of each different color.  If they can't remember, then I start to guess.  Hamburger?  Hot dog?  Turkey sandwich?  If I keep getting it wrong, the guesses get weirder.  Mouseburger?  Spider stew?  Monkey brain soup?
* If there are siblings in the room, I'll say: ""You must be Andrew (pointing to Lindsay), and you must be Lindsay! (pointing to Andrew).""  They'll laugh and say: ""nooooooo!""  And then I say: ""Oh, really?""  And then I cross my arms and try again and still get it wrong.  And then cross my arms even more (so it looks completely ridiculous) and still get it wrong.  And then I'll finally get fed up and ask one kid what her name and when she tells me, I'll say: ""Well, why didn't you say so?""
* ""How old are you?  Are you three?  You don't look three.  Are you eight?  Ten?  42?  You don't look 42.""
* I'll count fingers/toes and get it wrong every time, then re-count, and re-count...this can occupy a good 60 seconds.  
* If you have a paper or styrofoam cup, you can stick a tongue depressor through the bottom and voila!  Instant baby rattle!
* In older kids, if I try to do a fundoscopic exam, I'll ask them to stare straight at their parent's or sibling's nose.  ""Is she making funny faces at you?""  ""Now that I brought it up, is she making funny faces at you?""
* With especially silly (and healthy) kids, I'll pick them up, cradling them in my arms.  I'll tell them that the arm holding their legs is strong, but that the arm holding their head is --oops!-- weak and let their head drop, letting them swing upside-down.  This usually exposes a ticklish belly.  
* ""I have some excellent news.  You have a heart.  It's even beating!  I wish I had a heart.  All I have is a lump of ice-cold stone.""  (This gets a giggle from parents).  
* With my 11yos who have to get their shots, I offer them the option of being marched out in the waiting room where they have all the boys or girls (opposite-sex) from their class waiting and we can give them the shots in the butt.  Or they can get them here in the exam room in the arm.  Which would they like?  A bit of perspective works wonders.  ;)  Although I did have one kid take me up on the offer.

fibromyalgia and fascia - what do you know?,"I have been reading about the link between fascial dysfunction and fibromyalgia and find the info quite compelling. here is an abstract from a 2009 paper:

Fascia: A missing link in our understanding of the pathology of fibromyalgia.

Liptan GL1.

Abstract: Significant evidence exists for central sensitization in fibromyalgia, however the cause of this process in fibromyalgia-and how it relates to other known abnormalities in fibromyalgia-remains unclear. Central sensitization occurs when persistent nociceptive input leads to increased excitability in the dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord. In this hyperexcited state, spinal cord neurons produce an enhanced responsiveness to noxious stimulation, and even to formerly innocuous stimulation. No definite evidence of muscle pathology in fibromyalgia has been found. However, there is some evidence for dysfunction of the intramuscular connective tissue, or fascia, in fibromyalgia. This paper proposes that inflammation of the fascia is the source of peripheral nociceptive input that leads to central sensitization in fibromyalgia. The fascial dysfunction is proposed to be due to inadequate growth hormone production and HPA axis dysfunction in fibromyalgia. Fascia is richly innervated, and the major cell of the fascia, the fibroblast, has been shown to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, in response to strain. Recent biopsy studies using immuno-histochemical staining techniques have found increased levels of collagen and inflammatory mediators in the connective tissue surrounding the muscle cells in fibromyalgia patients. The inflammation of the fascia is similar to that described in conditions such as plantar fasciitis and lateral epicondylitis, and may be better described as a dysfunctional healing response. This may explain why NSAIDs and oral steroids have not been found effective in fibromyalgia. Inflammation and dysfunction of the fascia may lead to central sensitization in fibromyalgia. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it could significantly expand treatment options to include manual therapies directed at the fascia such as Rolfing and myofascial release, and direct further research on the peripheral pathology in fibromyalgia to the fascia.

"Had a couple close calls, need to vent.","Apologies in advance here.  I don't normally post for stuff like this, but my overnight shift last night shook me up a little bit, and still trying to process the couple of near-misses that I had.  First a little background.  I work at a medium-sized community hospital in a pretty large health system.  I'm on a little stretch of overnights right now.  They're really hit or miss at our hospital, since you have single physician coverage for most of the night.  You can have absolutely terrible ones where you start off bad and never catch up (as in you might not clear the waiting room until like 5 AM), or you might never really have more than like 4 or 5 patients in the ED after midnight.  So I guess that isn't too unusual for overnight shifts in the ED, but it just seemed like in residency there wasn't quite as much variation.

I'm a smidge over 2.5 years out of residency.  I firmly believe that an EM physician who thinks that they have it ""figured out"" is dangerously close to missing something, given the random crap that we see and deal with on a daily basis, but at the same time, I've seen quite a bit in my short career, and I think that I can handle the vast majority of what comes through the door without too much trouble.  Anyways, on to last night.  
My  last shift started out beautiful.  The first couple of hours were pretty light.  People to see, but nothing too bad to deal with, and we had empty beds in both the ED and the hospital.  It slowed down as the night went on, as it normally will do, and I was looking forward to a pretty decent shift overall.  Then I had two patients that kind of shook me.

The first one was an older guy who came in for chest pain.  Nothing too unusual, see it all the time.  Within like a minute I knew I was going to be admitting him.  The pain was in the chest, went up to his neck.  No dyspnea, some on/off nausea, no diaphoresis.  EKG looked completely normal.  Something just felt a smidge off, but I didn't think too much of it.  He had come in on oxygen from EMS, though it wasn't immediately obvious why.  I took it off of him, and his oxygen right after was like 95%, so I didn't think too much of it.  A couple of minutes later he was 93% on room air, and something still just felt weird.  I couldn't quite tell what it was, and I didn't really know why, but I thought heck, maybe he has a PE.  Worked a somewhat sedentary job, pulse ox a little lower than I'd expect.  I actually hate d-dimers, and think they're over-ordered.  If you're worried about a PE in someone who isn't young, I've always thought just scan them (criticize if you want, but that's not the purpose of the post).  So I scan him.  Blood pressure drifts down a little beforehand, but nothing too low.  On a whim I go over like a minute after he did to CT.  I walk in the room as he's getting the contrast for his CTA chest to rule out PE.  And boom, right there is a huge dissection.  CT tech and I just look at each other like holy crap.  Call the flagship hospital (my shop doesn't have CT surgery), fly him up there for emergency surgery.  His vitals got a little worse prior to flying out, so I probably would have scanned him eventually, but I didn't have a great reason to do it earlier.  Shook me a little bit how lucky I got.

While I'm arranging transport for that patient, a trauma patient came in.  Young guy, single-vehicle MVC rollover.  Complaining of a headache and not much else.  I evaluate him, order CT head, c-spine, and chest/abdomen/pelvis.  The only reason for the chest/abdomen/pelvis was the mechanism.  Has a small laceration to the scalp, bleeding a little but not that much.  CT scans show only a facial fracture.  He hadn't really complained of facial pain or tenderness, so I think that's a little weird.  I'm about to go suture his lac when I think to myself ""you know, maybe just scan his facial bones to make sure there isn't another fracture, the CT head doesn't get the whole face"".  So I send him back to CT.  He comes back, and I go in the room to suture the lac.  My phone goes off while I'm gloved up and about to suture, so I have a tech come in to get the phone out of my pocket.  It had actually gone off three times, the first two there was nobody in the room, and they got it for the third call.  They held the phone up to my ear, and radiology is now telling me that there is an epidural hematoma that they picked up on the facial bones CT.  I call the flagship hospital - we don't have neurosurgery at my shop - and fly him up there.  Fortunately GCS 15 and neuro exam normal upon transfer.

Basically radiology missed the epidural on the CT head.  It wasn't big, but it was there when you go back and look.  I hadn't looked at the images yet - I usually do before discharge - but I could have easily missed it scrolling through fast.  My CT tech - who is VERY good about picking up stuff like that in real time...unofficially of course - didn't see it.  It was the same radiologist that read both the CT head and then the later CT facial bones.  I'm shaking a little thinking that if I hadn't ordered that second CT, this kid would have gone home, fallen asleep, and died.  I know that I've missed stuff.  We all do.  But damn did that one hit home, and I'm not entirely sure why.  I think it was just how close I was to sending that kid home.

Anyways, I apologize for the long post.  Like I said, I don't normally post like this, but I'm just trying to process this.",medicine,1550415626,Xera3135,176,1448,True,2019-02-17

Doctors in Consulting," 

Dear Medical Community,

(Relatively) young doctor here, with 4 years of experience in clinical medicine and 4 years of experience in Health IT and Medical Devices. I've done alot of reading from threads in r/consulting, and the common underlying theme is that consulting firms value subject-matter expertise and in-depth experience.

I'm about to embark on a 2 year Masters in Healthcare Informatics, all the while heading a clinical affairs unit in a medical device startup. Truth be told, I've learned alot about the way a business works in the past 1 year in the startup, but am seriously considering an MBA after I complete my Masters.

The thing is, I'm struggling with deciding on embarking on an MBA in 2021. I've decided to pursue a career outside of Medicine, but still firmly related to it (if you get my drift?) and it will mean that I won't have time to practice. Do you think that remaining in practice will be valuable to a Consulting firm? Even if I do practice instead of pursuing a full-time MBA, it will mainly be family-medicine related and it won't really value-add to my subject matter expertise in that sense.  


Looking for astute advice from senior members here - I've looked for help in my own circle of friends/mentors/seniors but haven't found many medics who left medicine.  


Cheers and thanks in advance!

Need insight with NY Hospitalist offer with no outside-activity.,"Dear Meddits,

Hope this message finds you well. I am a graduating IM resident in NY, currently in the process of finding a job. I have been offered a contract from a prospective NY based company for hospitalist position, which I am seriously considering. As a hospitalist, an attractive part of the schedule is the moonlighting/locums opportunities on the week off, if one wishes to pursue it. However, upon carefully reading the contract, I have noted that it seems like the employer will not allow any outside activity.

Is this normal for all contract? Or is this an unusual one? Is it possible to negotiate out of it? I have not reached out to an attorney yet, but was wondering if possible to lift that restriction, how should I approach the employer without potentially risk losing the opportunity to work with them?

Thank you so much. Wasn't sure but figured this would be a good place to start.",medicine,1550431050,stico23,18,14,True,2019-02-17

Mid-level mutualistic relationship,"After reading through some of the comments on the recent post about stagnant md salary/rising mid level salary I figured I would post my experience.







I am practicing at a rural family clinic in a relatively undesirable area (rural SW).  In general I see 75% cough/cold acute minor complaints.  If there’s a question of what I should do I walk over and speak with the physician.  He’ll give advice, look at a picture, or in really significant cases actually step in and take a look at a patient. 





I think this type of relationship is really what a mid level should have to practice relatively safe and good medicine.  I miss shit.  Every once and a while I’ll catch something the physician misses.  We respect each other to communicate and understand our relationship is mutually beneficial.






On busy days it may be annoying getting held up for 5-10 minutes to speak about a few patients but he’s never belittling and always willing to help.  If I’m needed to do something to help him I make it a point to help out.






This sounds like a lot of extra work for him, but he gets compensated with 50% if whatever productivity bonus.  I think that’s fair.  Some months he may only get $1000 but there are a handful of months each year he’ll end up with $3000 - $4000.  






I wholeheartedly agree mid levels, whether NP or PA, are not prepared to the same level as physicians.  I know a lot of really bad mid-levels but I do know quite a few that are competent and responsible.  







At the end of the day I’m not the enemy of mid levels or physicians, I try to do as good a job as I can.  I’m still learning, fresh out of school I lived on up-to-date for even the most minor issues, I know a little now  but I’ll keep having to ask for help and I’m glad I am in a position to do so.

Difficult to internalize feelings about prolonging life of a dying patient.,"This is sort of a rant, but trying to find others that have had similar experiences is difficult outside the hospital. I'm a PGY1 so there's a lot of firsts this year that I haven't dealt with yet. There's this 93 year old that came to the floors with acute on chronic heart failure, pre-renal AKI c/b hyperkalemia, severely malnourished. Her heart fx is nearly nil, severe global dysfunction, multiple valve prolapses, severely dilated atria, afib w/ rvr. Her oxygen requirements were increasing in the hospital. Her mental fx decreasing. After speaking with her daughter on multiple occasions, she wants full code, no comfort care whatsoever. We tweak the pt up over a week with diuresis, control the afib, send her home with a hospital bed and oxygen (had to fight with daughter not to sign her out AMA without O2, because she thought we were causing her decline in function). Fast forward to yesterday. Same pt and daughter arrive to ED after pt has 15+ minute cardiac arrest. This was bound to happen. We were trying to make the pt comfortable during her last days, but pt's daughter wanted none of it. Pt's ribs are fractured, sternum broken. Fixed pupils, partial gag reflex, on multiple pressors. She survived. I've never been angry about a pt surviving a code. It was so difficult to look at this pt, tubed, pale, cachectic body. Thoughts of feeling ribs cracking during compressions. She's in the cardiac care unit now, but my co-residents told me she's still full code. Daughter refused to meet with the palliative care team. Sorry for the rant, but it's hard to internalize. It's strange to try to sway a pt's family member to shorten their loved one's life for quality of life. But it angers me that this daughter can't see the agony the pt was probably in before she coded. I guess she'll be kept artificially alive until her heart can't take any more stress from the pressors. Hopefully I can find peace in this pt surviving the code.",medicine,1550521975,CraveKnowledge,39,70,True,2019-02-18

"I’m getting crucified as a student nurse due to my ex neighbour (surgeon consult) showing attention to me whilst dating a clinical nurse manager. Please advise, I could fail my practicum due to this.","Hi there, just looking for advise from medical professionals whom might’ve  been in a similar situation. This is long, bear with me. 

I’m a third year student nurse who has recently started practicum. During my shift, I bumped into my old neighbour (lived next to him 4-5 years ago). Let’s call him MR T. I wouldn’t say we were very close, but definitely friendly towards one another and he often let me use his pool in the summer and on the occasion we would have a couple of wines since we both share a love for red wine. I moved away and contact dissipated naturally. 

When we bumped into each other after he gave me a huge hug in front of all the nurses and house officers, after a quick catch up he invited me out to lunch. I declined as I had already had my lunch break and wasn’t due for another one. He was fine about it and gave me a hug goodbye and told me it was due time for catch up drinks. When I returned to the nursing station I could feel a sudden shift from my preceptor and the other nurses. They asked me how I know him, and I explained he’s an old neighbour. They all rolled their eyes at me. It was pretty uncomfortable. An hour later my preceptor pulled me aside and told me to be “careful” because that particular surgeon is dating a clinical nurse leader, and that it looks bad on my part if I’m seen at lunch with him. 

I understand, that’s cool. 

Next morning I’m doing some paperwork and MR T phones the nursing station to ask if I’m there. After finding out I am he walks in and invites me to spend the morning shift doing his rounds and wants to show me a robotics machine he’s using to perform surgery. I obviously hesitate, and he perhaps mistakes this hesitation as me having to perform student nurse duties instead. My preceptor was with me at the time and he then asks her if it’s ok if I go with him, explaining it would be a great opportunity for me, she agrees, seems friendly about it towards him and I go off with him. Whilst extremely educational, it was awkward and I’m sure the house officers and registrars were wondering why I was hanging around on the rounds. 

Anyways, in the afternoon I return to my ward, and the negative atmosphere towards me is incredibly obvious. All the nurses are outright ignoring me, my preceptor is cold and short with me. I asked her about it and she explained that part of being a nurse is to know when not to cause ruffles and waves in the industry and that I should’ve declined the rounds with MR T. I have to be honest, I nearly teared up. At this point I’m really frustrated. She then storms out, leaving me with no idea how to handle this. I then attend to patients and she and the other nurses start to put me down in front of them, making me feel incompetent. 

I keep my cool and decide that if this behaviour continues, I will contact my school to be moved. Then as my shift is ending, Mr T comes back into the ward, inviting me out for drinks with him and his house officers. Fuck. I told him I’ve already got plans. I was clearly visibly tense as I knew all the other nurses were watching. 

A few hours later after my shift ended he called me, wanting to know if I was ok and if something happened, I explained to him that I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to interact too much while I’m on practicum due to hospital gossip and the fact he’s dating a clinical nurse leader. He becomes upset, explains he went on two dates weeks apart with this clinical nurse leader and that shouldn’t stop him from helping and talking to an old friend. I tell him not to worry about it, that we can be friends outside of work. 

I’m now on my next shift and my preceptor has pulled me aside telling me everyone knows I’m the reason Mr T has dumped the clinical nurse leader and that this has now become a situation and that she has contacted the nursing school and thinks that it’s no longer appropriate for to work in the hospital. 

I’m currently in the toilet, crying, wondering whether it’s possible for me to complete this practicum in another setting as this is the only hospital in my area and my practicum has to be in a hospital setting. I’m hoping I can explain everything to my school, I’m unsure whether they will support me. What’s my next move, and how do I fix this??

Emaciated and bitter about the chronic disease (and shitty home life) that has demeaned him so long and turned him into a piece of meat that needs to be fed through tubes.  For 5 days, every interaction with any hospital staff involves screaming, swearing, perseverating in the face of evidence (convinced his vitals and lab values are all wrong), and threats.  Refuses cares, splits, flips, refuses treatment then says he'll accept it but is always found to be away from room, outside smoking. Chart review indicates vague previous diagnosis of psychosis but assessment (with affirmation from psych consult) is worse: schizotypal, i.e. ""terrifying but just outside of any indication for inpatient psych"", i.e. ""nothing we can do--maybe outpatient therapy?"" 

Every profile you've seen of a mass murderer. Thin, white, young male, bitter, put down his whole life, violent verbally and physically. I was the only one there when he called the nurses ""f\*cking n\*\*\*\*\*s"". First time in my short clinical career when I had to consider how to document the n-word in a note. Hoping there won't be as many more times as I'm starting to realize there will be. I'm going into psych. I love humans, but this one lost my empathy.

Today: ""this is why I wish I'd brought a weapon with me here. You're all f\*cking idiots, I'm superior to all of you""

&amp;#x200B;

I was there with the intern and senior resident when he said this (we had already decided to only see him in a group).  During table rounds, I presented as usual--interval events, subjective (disputes validity of overnight temperature reading indicating fever), vitals (feverish overnight, normothermic at this time), lab values, imaging, assessment, plan. Plan is: discharge asap. At the end, the intern asks, ""do you want to tell him about the comments?"" and I describe the incident. Attendings just switched over and this one hasn't met the guy yet. I say that I am concerned that he could very well show up at the hospital with a machine gun and our team would be his first target. Together we discuss the sincerity of the threat, call psych, I am not on the case anymore, I can have a different patient. 

&amp;#x200B;

Psych is upping the frequency of their follow, helping us find a place he can go to on discharge that will handle both his medical needs and need to be behind locked doors. I don't think security was called. I looked up red flag laws in my state, efforts are being made to put it in place but it's not here yet. I keep picturing what would happen. I spent the day assessing safety exits and looking up laws in my state.

For just simple things like VitD deficiency, it seems much more convenient to just text/message a patient about it and call when it's something more serious. Even with scheduling, the front desk has to call each patient to confirm, cancel, reschedule, etc. Texting would save so much time for them.

A question from a pharmacist to PCPs regarding controls,"Hello everyone, I’m new to this subreddit so please excuse me if this isn’t the right place to post this discussion. I’ve been practicing as a pharmacist for about a year and a half at this point and wanted to hear from prescribers their perspective on continual monthly prescribing of narcotics/benzos. I see these as two different but linked issues, but will address them differently.

Benzos: When I see a patient on straight Xanax 1-2 mg TID, with no other supportive psych meds, a huge red flag shoots up. My understanding is for the vast majority of situations, benzos should not be the backbone of therapy for anxiety. SSRI/SNRI and/or buspirone should be the backbone (I know there are other pharmacological classes like bupropion that can be tried as well). However time after time I see benzos dished out like candy. I spent about 30 mins talking to a patient yesterday about her therapy and she said her appointments consist of her coming in, her doc asking if she takes her meds and if things are ok, and then writing a script for more Xanax. Why isn’t there an active attempt to deescalate to a safer agent? Is there a fear the patient won’t come back? Is there just too much hassle?

Opioids: Dear god the amount of issues revolved around opioids are enough to make a sane man crazy. I have multiple patients that will call starting about a week out for their next fill of hydrocodone and ask daily “When can I get it? When did I get it last? Can I get it early (I fill 2 days early already), did the doctor send it in?” This will repeat monthly. I’m just curious if they call y’all the same amount. Anyways, I have some patient with obvious pain issues or cancer patients, this is not about them. This about the able bodied 40 year old dudes that have been unemployed for a decade and have nothing better than to try to score narcs. Why continue writing for them 1 q 4h prn QD? Why is there no plan to deescalate? I’ve seen some theorize that this type of prescribing is an easy guaranteed pay check every month because these patients will come back for their “appointments”. I’m hoping this isn’t true.

To summarize my questions:

Why are benzos used so commonly as monotherapy for anxiety?

Why do I never see any attempt (besides 1 patient who underwent successful surgery), to deescalate opioids?

The patients with obvious drug seeking behavior. What do you do to put a stop to it?

I hope none of this came out accusatory. I honestly want to hear your side. I have a corresponding responsibility as a pharmacist, and believe me I have refused to fill and dismissed patients who refuse to follow pain management/psych plans. But ultimately they can just walk down the street and fill elsewhere.",medicine,1550697193,Gardwan,244,446,True,2019-02-20

A friendly request to all you awesome docs from your friends in the pharmacy.,"If you have a patient with a potential for abuse, please use caution when prescribing and refilling your patients’ Gabapentin prescriptions.

We have started to see a lot of abuse issues (it’s a controlled med in some states already)

We have patients on 3,600mg/day trying to fill it weeks early.  When they call their PCP most are like “sure fill whatever they need”

We have had to move it to a “no more than 2 days early refill medication” same rule we use for controlled meds.

Don’t get me wrong, there are a TON of people that it works for, and it works great for many, just be a bit more cautious.

Thanks,

Pharmacists in retail hell.

Difficulty encountered when using EZ-IO,"EZ-IO problems.

Hi guys,

I'm a Paramedic in the UK. I had a really awkward call the other day where my patient required IV access, however had absolutely no veins that I could see or feel. Naturally, as my patient was unconscious and time-critical, I used the EZ-IO. 

After gaining IO access at the tibia, I aspirated the access site and got a good 2ml of marrow, confirming to me that the IO was in the right place. I take my flush, attempt to flush the IO and... Nothing. The syringe will not budge and there is so much resistance that I can't flush even 1ml of saline, let alone use the IO to administer medication. 

Has anyone else had this? This is the second time in a row that this has happened to me using the EZ-IO. Is there any way to salvage the IO at this point or any technique I can use to improve the chances of success?

Instead, even surgeries were discussed very perfunctorily and it was clear that the attendings showed signs of compassion fatigue. In ophtho, too, I noticed the physicians trying to keep things going along. All the patients had to wait for 2 hours to be seen. There was also not enough time to fully show compassion and be there for a patient who just found out that she had a rare retinopathy that would severely limit her vision in the future.

Need help finding good data (on maternal intravascular volume changes during gestation),"If this is not the correct sub to ask this question please direct me to the right sub. Thank you in advance for any help and for taking this seriously.

I am doing research on intravascular volume changes during gestation (plasma and red blood cell increase and total blood volume). An example of date that I would like to find:

* Plasma volume increase/decrease by week
* RBC Volume increase/decrease by week
* Total blood volume increase/decrease by week
* Platelet increase/decrease by week

The data that I can find is very limited and mainly consists of graphs without the data available (like this: [http://resources.ama.uk.com/glowm\_www/graphics/figures/v2/0130/008f.gif](http://resources.ama.uk.com/glowm_www/graphics/figures/v2/0130/008f.gif)). I have extracted data points from these graphs but this is very time consuming and not very accurate. One of the goals of this research is to compare hematocrit (HCT) of healthy individuals to individuals with blood issues or a history of blood disease in order to be able to extrapolate developments based on current lab outcomes.

The Old Guard,"I am an attending who started practice this year. My frustrations with the old guard of surgeons continues to this day and I had an especially annoying day with a senior consulting surgeon. 

My primary frustrations include:

1. Implications the medicine was better or harder when they began - I can not even agree with this as a 33 year old. They practiced based on at best limited evidence which was only available if you went to the library before every case. I still can't figure out what they were doing working 120+ hours, but I definitely hear about it.
2. Their pay - They are still paid much higher than I am as a starting physician, and also started higher. Additionally many have pensions that none of the younger physicians will see.
3. Resistant to change - The EMR is bad, someone else needs to do this for me. The new rules are bad, someone stop them. They literally are non-functional without an APP or resident. It's embarrassing. I don't NEED a resident to start a case. They are there to learn. Why do you NEED someone to type three lines in the computer for me. 
4. Implications younger surgeons don't work hard enough to be good - this one is self explanatory. I look at the way they practice and think about 50% need to remediate or read more. I am however in no position to say this and usually experience trumps evidence where I work. 

Has anyone else dealt with and managed some of these issues? I am getting frustrated with senior colleagues who seem to all echo this issues which to me fall on deaf ears. They are still however the group in control. ",medicine,1550951341,SpartansPRS,165,571,True,2019-02-23

"A question to Providers, Psychologists and Counselors regarding Rape and Sexual Assault","A little background about myself first - I’m a Navy Corpsman with a unit that provides inpatient care to Marines and Sailors. Every once in a while, I provide care in field-environments, such as training exercises and hikes that our Marines conduct. While my position has both slow and exciting days, it’s pretty well-balanced and I’m happy with it. 

I typically handle the injuries you’d expect to encounter in an operational unit, such as broken bones, heat exhaustion, sunburns, etc.. However, I had a recent intake that left me disappointed in myself. For the sake of confidentiality, I will only say that I had an individual approach me to make a restricted report after they were raped. 

I know my patient was well-taken care of, and they left with both confidence and an ease of mind, but experience tells me that if I felt something was lacking, I could have done better and I’m ashamed of the fact. 

I’ve asked the provider I work under, the nurse I work alongside with, as well as our Sexual Assault Prevention &amp; Response coordinator, but most, if not all of our references and literature don’t provide much more insight than I already know. 

I don’t work behavioral health, but if anyone can make any recommendations or suggestions for literature, studies, and references, I would greatly appreciate it.

Safe duration of conscious (IV) sedation in pediatric patients?,"Hi Meddit,

I recently learned of a departmental policy at my institution where pediatric patients are not allowed to receive more than 45 minutes of IV sedation for procedures in the emergency department (entirely under the independent and direct supervision of someone licensed to provide sedation to children), and if we anticipate a procedure taking longer than this then we are required to set the patient up for the operating room with general anesthesia. This time limit includes any time spent performing an exam while under sedation, in addition to the actual procedure needing to be done. The procedures my specialty performs are often not complex, just time intensive, and the patients are **always** hemodynamically stable without any life threatening injuries prior to our service attempting any procedure.

The cited reason for the policy is that it is unsafe for children to receive IV sedation for more than 45 minutes. 

I have always thought subjecting a child to general anesthesia and intubation presents a much larger risk to children, not to mention the tremendous costs associated with taking a patient to the operating room. 

I have looked into the literature and have not found a single source to back up this claim. I'm wondering if any of my colleagues on /r/meddit have any sources discussing the safe duration of IV sedation in pediatric patients? ",medicine,1551048042,medschoolthrowaway28,0,1,True,2019-02-24

descendants across five successive generations each killed themselves at the age of 45. 
And in 2009, 46 years after his mother, the poet Sylvia Plath, stuck her head in the oven 
after sealing the windows and doors to keep the gas from seeping into the children's 
rooms, her son Nicholas Hughes, a fisheries biologist, hanged himself in Alaska.

Question about responding to patients who want all of the tests regardless of evidence. (when less is more),"No doubt discussed here before, but I need a better understanding as to why it is better practice to order tests conservatively (If it is at all):-

Put simply: 

If a patient comes in, and money is no problem, why should you not relent and test them for things that there is little evidence to test for if it assuages their fears?

I understand that the answer probably lies partially in statistics - that is - if we test 100 people randomly for X, then the likelihood of false positives will mean patients are unnecessarily subjected to possibly invasive and expensive procedures, but I think this must be a very surface level understanding.

I would sincerely appreciate any links to previous questions similar to this, links to articles related, and just any explanations.

I understand it's more prevalent now mostly because people shack up in the cold and cough all over eachother, but also peoples immune systems are weaker in the cold so its a double whammy.

The point I'm making is this virus loves cold.

It is my current understanding that the body naturally raises its temp, itself to help fight off this virus hence the raised body temp during periods of sickness.

After getting sick of the flu today I thought fuck it I'm gonna essentially Nuke my whole body with heat and create an inhospitable environment for this flu, I'm going to give it a nuclear summer (like stranger things season 2 with Will )

So today when I woke up, I got a shower and put the water so hot i could just barely tolerate it, I stayed in this shower for a good 25 - 30 minutes to make sure that heat soaked right into my core, then I put the plug in the bath and left the shower on (one of them showers that goes into the tub)

So now on top of the hot shower water falling down my face, I was also laying in this same said hot water, again just to make sure this heat goes right into my body, I then stayed like this for a further 30 minutes.

In total I've spent 1 hour today in water so hot I could just barely tolerate it, after said dual shower+bath, I dried off and Now I'm lying on top of my bed wearing a winter hat, 3 t shirts, 2 pairs of socks, a dressing gown and a neck warmer, I also have my radiators on and windows closed.

Study: Neonatal [genital cutting] and prematurity are associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),"https://www.jctres.com/en/04.201802.005/

&gt;Background: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is the most common cause of postneonatal unexplained infant death. The allostatic load hypothesis posits that SIDS is the result of cumulative perinatal painful, stressful, or traumatic exposures that tax neonatal regulatory systems. 

&gt;Aims: To test the predictions of the allostatic load hypothesis we explored the relationships between SIDS and two common phenotypes, male neonatal [genital cutting] (MNC) and prematurity. 

&gt;Methods: We collated latitudinal data from 15 countries and 40 US states sampled during 2009 and 2013. We used linear regression analyses and likelihood ratio tests to calculate the association between SIDS and the phenotypes. 

&gt;Results: SIDS mortality rate was significantly and positively correlated with MNC. Globally (weighted): Increase of 0.6 (95% CI=0.01–0.1, t=2.86, p=0.01) per 1000 live-births SIDS mortality per 10% increase in [genital cutting] rate

A Pediatric Surgeon had this to say recently (unclear if related to the study or not): ""The American Academy of Pediatrics should revise its inhumane guidelines on [male genital cutting]. If there is no religious or medical reason for a male infant to be cut, this elective procedure should be outlawed for its lack of informed consent and unnecessary surgical risk.""

""[Infant male genital cutting] is a surgical procedure that confers actual surgical risk to the male infant. Condoms are far more effective than [cutting] in preventing HIV and other STDs so why is there a need for such an invasive and permanent surgery. Condoms prevent unwanted pregnancy too.""

Gadolinium Retention Induced Toxicity - Chelation - MTHFR Speculated Role In Heavy Metal Excretion/Explusion or “Detox”,"Hello r/medicine! 
I was recently injected with a Gadolinium based contrast dye for an MRI recently. Immediately upon injection i was immediately met with negative symptoms, and since then have only experienced more. It is well documented in FDA and manufacturer warnings, and numerous studies that Gadolinium is now being retained in all bodily tissues for years post-exposure, including bone and brain tissue. 

Though many people have numerous MRI’s throughout their lifetimes with no ill-effects, it is becoming increasingly apparent that this metal is not harmless either, breaking free of its retained chelates intended to make it safe in the first place, and causing massive problems for numerous sufferers in online enclaves, who report staggeringly similar symptoms. Though many of the earlier symptoms include some common symptoms of other diseases including chronic pain, neuropathy, vision loss, burning sensations, reddening/swelling of joints, many of these sufferers undergo rigorous testing for other conditions that comes up empty-handed, with their only commonality being Gadolinium exposure, retention shown by lab tests, and their shared symptoms. A majority of those further into this Gadolinium “toxicity” show a worryingly consistent development of cardiac issues due to fibrosing organ tissue, and osteoporosis, probably due to the above mentioned blocking of calcium channels. Research on this is ongoing.

The development of these symptoms long term have also brought to question whether the known “Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis” is actually it’s own condition, and not just “10 out of 10” severe case of more common Gadolinium toxicity only experienced by those with severe renal failure, who are unable to excrete as much Gadolinium as those with normal renal function before the rest settles into bodily tissues to do long term damage.
 I will link many studies and manufacturer warnings done showing retention, breaking of the chelate bonds, and negative symptoms, even treatments currently being developed to more effectively chelate Gadolinium from the body, here:

A site started by these sufferers outlines their symptoms here: 
https://gadoliniumtoxicity.com/help/symptoms/

However, I am not here to debate whether or not you think it is dangerous. I would like to make it clear I have never been one to be crazy about naturopathic treatments/gene testing/anti-vaxx or the sort, always thinking that though supplements may fix conditions caused by a lack thereof/prevent disease and be important to health, there is no “root of banana” or something that will cure cancer or things of that nature. I’ve got every essential vaccine, and (usually) get my flu shot every year unless I forget. 

However with this entire topic being somewhat “fringe” science, and people being forced to treat themselves due to denial of danger by the FDA, there is often quite a bit of spillover of both communities, with many opting for legitimate chelation protocols and treatment, and others opting for supplementation to “heavy metal detox,” and often a combination of both. Myself currently opting for DTPA chelation, however I’m still doing tons of research to prevent negative reactions/damage, and seeking out an experienced physician to do it and not some naturopath who will kill me in the back of a supplement store. 
A common theme I see appearing regarding this in my internet sleuthing, however, is the danger of certain gene mutations preventing heavy metal expulsion, one being MTHFR gene mutations, and that this may be a complication during chelation and should be known prior. Though I can find numerous credible incriminating studies for Gadolinium, when searching for MTHFR and other gene mutations I’m met with Anti-Vaxx mercury-retention-causing-autism articles and other things of the sort. Though I want to brush that off, an apparent and known danger in chelation is possibility of transmetallation of this Gadolinium with other bodily metals especially in older members who commonly have elevated levels of retained mercury and others from fillings/implants etc. 

Where is the even ground? What are your thoughts on these gene mutations that apparently cause inhibited expulsion of metals from the body? Any thoughts on the rest of the information are also welcomed.

I’ll make this short but my current FI and I have been together for 5+ years and our sex life went from very active (5x a week) to now months 
 with no sex for the last 1.5 years. Six months of this he’s been in residency. He is a good partner, but I’ve become miserable that our sex life may never improve. I tried to find similar threads within the med field and there wasn’t much out there. 

I also feel horrible for doing this but I snooped in his browser history and two days after I talked to him about improving things in bed, he watched porn and masturbated (which I’m fine with masturbation and porn but not to replace intimacy). I don’t have a crazy high libido, but a few times a month would be fine with me knowing his schedule. I’m posting in here to see if his low libido is normal or if this may be a compatibility issue with my partner. 

FYI: I’m an attractive female and I’m fit. I’m also sure he is not cheating. His residency is known to have a better lifestyle, not surgery or any of the hardcore ones.

Maximize Flexibility - Hospitalist Per Diem only?,"Dear Meddit,

I was reading about a hospitalist who maximized his schedule flexibility by doing local per-diem only shifts. He signed a few per-diem contracts with local hospitals and works as much / as little as he wants. If he wants to do 10 shifts next month he does it, if he wants to do 0 he does it. Since he is signed with local hospitals, he doesn't have to do the traveling of a typical locums. (Here are his posts: [https://thelocumguy.com/hospitalist-lifestyle/](https://thelocumguy.com/hospitalist-lifestyle/), [https://thelocumguy.com/work-locum-tenens-always-sleep-home/](https://thelocumguy.com/work-locum-tenens-always-sleep-home/))

  
To someone who wants to maximize flexibility to work on interests outside of medicine down the line, this sounds very appealing. It addresses some of the issues of 7on/7off (unable to take longer stretches of time off, working weekends/holidays) and some of the issues of traditional locums (traveling away from family).

The VA is not as bad as you think,"I get pretty upset whenever I come across poorly-informed online posts talking negatively about the care provided by the VA, but the comments in response to yesterday's ""VA Seeks to Redirect Billions of Dollars Into Private Care"" struck even more of a nerve than usual.


The VA is not nearly as bad as public perception.  Because I might already be losing some of you, let me give you some data/references.

Here's a RAND study showing that care provided by the VA compares favorably to other healthcare systems:
https://www.rand.org/news/press/2018/04/26.html

Here are articles that talk about how the increased reliance of the VA on private medical care has cost the government more, led to longer wait times, and has not improved care: 
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/sending-vets-to-private-care-isnt-solving-the-vas-problems.html
https://khn.org/morning-breakout/private-care-for-veterans-touted-as-solution-to-vas-troubles-but-analysis-finds-it-creates-longer-wait-times-higher-costs/

And despite complaints that I frequently encounter on social media about the VA's EMR (CPRS), it routinely ranks the highest in physician satisfaction surveys: https://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/public/ehr2016#page=8


-----------


So now, if care provided by the VA isn't bad, why do so many people think it is?

Here are a few explanations:

Selection bias - Everyone, from patients to healthcare professionals, are more likely to publicly talk about negative experiences than positive ones.  Just as it's true of restaurant and product reviews, it's true in medicine.

Reporting bias - If you think about stories you've heard in the media about hospital and healthcare systems, they are more often negative than positive ones.   (e.g. St. Luke's cardiac transplant scandal).  Since most hospitals are not part of an integrated health care system or nationally renown academic centers, most scandals end up in the local news, and as long as an affected patient doesn't launch a social media campaign, the story remains unknown to the vast majority of the country.  With the VA though, every scandal that affects as few as one of the VA's ~170 medical centers ends up in the national news.  An endoscopy suite in a VA in Jacksonville, Florida infects a dozen patients with HCV because of inadequately sterilized colonoscopes - that's getting reported everywhere.  But if that same scenario happens at a private hospital down the street, no one outside Florida will ever hear about it.

Confirmation bias - Anyone who already thinks the VA sucks remembers new negative stories about the VA (or even actively seeks them out), while ignoring or forgetting the positive ones.

Playing politics - Because the VA is under control of the federal government and involves our military veterans, it's an obvious topic on which politicians and pundits can try to ""score points"" with their bases and dedicated viewers, respectively.  If my Congresswoman wants to trade barbs with a political challenger, no one's going to care if she starts talking about appointment wait times at our local Kaiser hospital.

Outdated information - Most physicians' experience with the VA system came during training, and *most* people on /r/medicine are at least a few years out of training.  Therefore, the first-hand impression of the VA among those here is necessarily outdated.

Patient population - The VA takes care of patients that most medical centers honestly just wouldn't.  Our patients are sicker, poorer, are more socially marginalized, and have more psychiatric comorbidities than the patients at most other hospitals.  Comparing our outcomes to St. Joe Shmoe Hospital in a random suburban ""Middle American"" town is like comparing graduation rates between a public school in inner city Oakland and a private school in Marin.   Also consider that most healthcare systems would have absolutely no idea what to do with some of our patients.  My VA has entire inpatient units dedicated to patients with TBI and spinal cord injury.  &gt;99% of non-VA hospitals can't provide the type and quality of care for these patients that these units do.

----------


As did many of you, I partially trained at a VA.  After a year as a hospitalist at an underwhelming private secondary care facility, I became a hospitalist at a VA - where I've been for 12 years.  I also split my time with a world-renown academic center.

While the relative quality of the care provided by those two places differs depending on the condition and service, there are some diagnoses that I would literally prefer to be treated at our VA.   The VA is certainly not perfect.  Every hospital has their problems.  But every hospital isn't under a constant microscope by television reporters and politicians in the way that the VA is.

In short, if you think that your local VA sucks, it says something about that particular place, not about the other 1200+ VA facilities.

--------


Last, nothing makes me more angry about this topic than when I hear a healthcare professional talk about how supportive they are of vets while simultaneously advising others to never work at a VA because it's so awful.

My counterpoint: If you think that the VA is providing poor care to our veterans, choosing a job that allows you to directly improve that care is more productive than complaining about it on the internet.

Most of the people I know who work at the VA - physicians, nurses, and staff - could easily get a job elsewhere, but have chosen to work at a VA, for less money and less prestige, because they believe in its mission.  They believe that they are doing something important and meaningful for our country.  It's incredibly insulting when anonymous redditors shit on that by using stories from a single facility or from an experience during a single encounter to totally dismiss all of the good that the department of nearly 400,000 people do every day.

Discussion about Urogenital Diaphragm,"Hello lads,

Today I wish to ask you, already graduated doctors and surgeons, about one specific topic that has caused a lot of discussion in and out of the dissecting rooms.

Here at the university, I study, we are taught by some teachers (Dr./PhD/Professors), normally younger ones, that the Urogenital Diaphragm is a non-existing muscle, used as a referential point during anatomical description for the previous decades. They do explain and give all the description but they tend to firmly assure the students that it is a non-existing thing and that they will not be able to find in the body.

The other side of the coin is that older professors, with more credibility and experience, say that IT IS an existing muscle and they fully believe and teach to their respective assigned groups.

The main issue is that during examinations, we have a practical part and a theoretical part. The practical part is separated into blocks (Head and Neck, Thorax, Abdomen, Pelvis and Perineum) and you must pass all of them before heading to the theoretical. These practices are held by younger non-professors but still Dr. (PhD/M.D.) young teachers. The theoretical exam - which are oral exams - the ones conducting the whole thing are the old lads who will not take another explanation or arguments that go against their knowledge (30-40 years ago). The whole thing is confusing and just to add more pressure, the final examination is an Anatomy, Histology and Embryology exam (all evaluated together, failed one fails all) about a certain picked topic (Eg. Anatomy, Histology, Embryology of Vagina).

I've looked through some articles and most of them confirm the fact that it is a non-existing muscle. On the readings considered referential in our university for anatomy, Grey's Student and Moore's, the first describes it as an existing structure and the latter makes a point of the old usage and explains that the concept is slowly fading away. I also checked the BRS - Gross Anatomy (I use for review) and it describes a Urogenital Diaphragm but it also says that it posses other names.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as description, the one that I found most logical and my teacher gave as well is

""The urogenital diaphragm is a triangular musculofascial space enclosed by a superior facia and an inferior fascia (perineal membrane) that houses the deep transverse perineal and sphincter urethrae muscles. It is located between the deep perineal pouch, inferiorly, and the pubic arches, superiorly.""

&amp;#x200B;

I wish to know and get your perspective on whether this structure is an existing structure which can be shown in the cadaver or if it is just a descriptive artefact. Perhaps you could also provide me with some articles that approach the topic.

Random Rant: Why is the chiropractor profession so damn greedy,"I usually subscribe to the dogma of not belittling my brethren in health care. Everyone has their own part to play and i for the most part respect that. But recently i've been doing alot of IMEs and disability work, and the sheer amount of bullshit from chiropractors is staggering. I've seen a low speed MVC whiplash be seen by a DC EVERYDAY for 3 months followed by every other day for another 3 months for ""whole body strains/sprains"". No imaging. No referral when obviously whatever treatment they're doing isn't working. I've seen DC's try to call a strain/sprain a permanent issue that's not recoverable and ask for lifetime disability. In the Oregon area, where they are legally treated as real physicians, they read their own MRIs. It is legit worrisome, like a real life snakeoil salesman going way beyond their scope of practice. If we in the medical community pulled that shit, we'd be facing the Board in no time. We have our own issues, don't get me wrong, but an overwhelming amount of people in this profession (not all of them mind you) see people as dollar signs and it's disgusting.

Law Enforcement erroneously charging docs with erroneously prescribing patients pain meds,"The impetus of this post is to start an honest and open discussion about a troubling trend in I've witnessed.

In the past year, I've noticed two docs, one of whom I shadowed, get charged with indiscriminately prescribing pain meds. This has yielded them to surrender their license. Following up on these two cases, it seems that the cases were so baseless that they weren't even indicted. And for anyone who knows a little about process of law, a ham sandwich can get indicted. I know one of them even got a letter from a member of the American Academy of Pain Medicine essentially stating that the doc followed the standard protocols and that there was no malice (probably why it didn't go to trial). While free from conviction, this doctor has had his license stripped, reputation destroyed, and working relentlessly to get the license back.

 While law enforcement is trying to be virtuous by alleviating this opioid issue, my conviction is that they are trying to put out a fire with fire. Common sense tells you that word gets around that when doctors are baselessly getting accused of medical malice, there becomes this mass hysteria from other doctors. This yields in doctors growing extremely wary of prescribing patients pain meds, because there is no reason to risk one's career. And from my understanding, when people need to decrease their pain, they will find a way. And this is where we run into trouble.

I believe that law enforcement, albeit good intentions, is essentially on a witch hunt devoid of sound reasoning. This is an issue of epic proportions and anyone who says that they have the answer is full of shit. It's ruining doctors careers based on swiss cheese and in effect exacerbating the issue. While I know there are many working hard on this issue; it's failing. 

&amp;#x200B;

CBD Oil Insomnia,"I just figured out what has caused my insomnia to be permanent. 
I was taking CBD oil that was recommended to me for allergies. 
Not for anxiety I wasn’t really having that bad of anxiety and could handle myself well. 
I took it for about 7 months. 
Everything was good to start. 
But then I would get a funny feeling in my head and panic then I started getting crazy panic attacks. 
Didn’t even cross my mind that it was the oil. 
I started having terrible insomnia but ignored it. 
Started taking Flonase for a few months and that’s when I eventually stopped sleeping. 
That went off and on for a while not sleeping/sleeping between going to my parents and staying at my place. 
Have dreams sometimes but am awake at the same time. 
I know it was the CBD oil and wish I could turn back time where I never picked up the stuff because before my health was fine. 
I had started slowing but took up to 3 dropper fulls daily sometimes an additional half a dropper in between. 
Now I hardly eat and am depressed from not sleeping. 
Does anyone know of this happening?
Is there any way of erasing the damage from CBD oil?

URGENT: I don't know what speciality to get in !!!,"Hey docs,  
I am a freshly graduated doctor, and I have to apply for residency **NEXT WEEK**!!  
My problem is: I don't know what is the best specialty for me?  
I always enjoyed the physiology and pathology aspects of any disease, I even loved biochemistry, thus I thought I like **internal medicine**, but indeed I really hate the long lists of DDx and sheets-long algorithms! I mean I feel like there is more memorization in it than creative thinking.

I like the treatment (rather than management in IM) part of **surgery**, the environment of OR and the fast impact on patients but my problems with surgery are less problem solving nature and my neck pain :(, I always had severe neck pain at surgeries (&amp; after spending time on phone) that only relieves with Ketoprofen or laying back, that made me forget thinking about it as a specialty but as the clock is ticking and as many residents told me it can be resolved, I'm rethinking it.

I liked the world of **Ob/Gyn**, the variety of cases and the variety of subspeciality options but I was hold back by the very serious complications (and lawsuits) and again neck pain.

Finally, what I can say about me is: I believe I am a thinker more than a doer, I love to get the job done and enjoy life outside medicine. I just need your help guys if anyone of you went through my situation.",medicine,1547597560,slemanyanos,1,1,True,2019-01-15

So you want to start a union?,"I see comments on this sub frequently stating physicians need to unite/unionize, etc. I think that's a great thing but people have been saying the same thing in pharmacy for eons and jackshit has been done to actually do it. But rather than say you are screwed, if you folks want, I'll help you unite and start fighting back.  

If you're wondering why a JD gives a shit or wtf I know about getting this done, I'll explain. I was a member of a non-profit for an orphan condition that provided support for patients. One pharmaceutical company, whose sole source of income depends on this condition, well over a billion dollars, donated half of the entire budget for the nonprofit and basically took control of the organization. Said pharmaceutical company, sent letters threatening to take the medication away from the patients unless they signed a HIPAA waiver allowing the company to use protected information for marketing purposes. I've seen some sketchy shit but I couldn't believe it. Naturally I suggested we fight back and I would look into suing the fuckers. 

Shortly after, the nonprofit, with almost no notice, terminated the support group, which had existed for close to a decade and had tens of thousands of posts and thousands of members. Apparently the pharmaceutical company  wasn't pleased with the criticism. The member begged them to keep it functioning and we couldn't even get a response. It devastated the community. No one knew what to do and felt helpless. So I did something crazy, I suggested we start our own. Naysayers were vocal, saying it was hopeless. No one else stepped up to lead, so I did. We reached our funding goal in less than a day and we were up and running in two weeks. A year later we were the largest group for the condition and page one on Google. 

An insider MD I've been friends with for years confirmed it was the pharmaceutical company behind the shutdown. The MD was terrified regarding retaliation and was worried I'd face their wrath if I caused trouble. Pretty sure the MD thought I was nuts when I said they could bring it on. After chatting with them later, the MD expressed their frustration with the current state of medicine, namely administration. The MD loves medicine and is one of the kindest people I've ever known, but seemed to be miserable for the same reasons you folks mention. It pissed me off so here I am. 

So I know a thing or two about starting an organization and rallying people to a common cause, not to mention the legal bullshit that entails. It's a lot of work but despite not making a dime, saving that group was unquestionably the most rewarding thing I've ever done. 

After living half my life with an undiagnosed condition and one physician that broke the time limit rules and went way beyond adequate care, diagnosed it and changed my life forever, I am physician advocate to the end. My wife is also an MD. 

I can't lead the charge on this one. One of you folks commented months ago suggesting, I organize physicians but the letters at the end of my name sort of preclude that. But I can help and participate if just a handful of you are passionate, willing to take action and able devote your time to change. 

With or without me, stop just talking. It's getting worse and it's going to become harder to change the more time passes. Take action. Physicians and their patients deserve better. 

Apologies for the personal story. I figured the post wouldn't make sense without some background. I'm happy to provide more information on how to get this going if you folks are interested.

Role of PPAR-y and tumor suppression in breast cancer cells," When discussing oncological therapies, there are multiple pathways to induce apoptosis and suppress metastasis. One such nuclear pathway is PPAR targets. Subtypes include PPAR alpha (a), Beta (b), sigma (o) and gamma (y). PPAR-γ activation has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells, especially in breast cancer cells by means of deactivation of aromatase in cytochrome P450 (CYP19) in adipose tissue. Aromatase expression in adipose tissue is regulated via the distal promoter I.4, under the control of glucocorticoids and class I cytokines such as oncostatin M, interleukin 6, and interleukin 11, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha, with cytokines inhibiting adipose differentiation. With regards to PPAR-y which has been shown to induce adipose tissue differentiation, PPAR-y ligands inhibit aromatase of estrogen in adipose tissue, most useful in postmenopausal women.

Screening for traditionally non-screenable cancers?,"Hi, I'm just having shower thoughts. As an OBGYN resident, I know that some cancers, like ovarian, just do not have good screening methods. From what I understand, most of it comes from a combination of the screens not working or just not being cost effective. Now my question is if the latter is more of an issue, what is your opinion on someone wealthy paying out of pocket for screening? For example. I am deathly scared of pancreatic cancer. I know an MRI has no long-term negative effects. As cost-inefficient as it is, would me paying out of pocket every 1-2 years for an MRI for pancreatic cancer for peace of mind actually be a thing? The odds of me developing pancreatic cancer is low since i have none of the risk factors, but I'm just terrified of it....

AstraZeneca’s ATR project has yielded a clinical candidate.,"6738 is a suloximine (S=N), replacing the sulfonamide moiety of the hit AZ20. Apparently, this SNOH- moiety hanging off the cyclopropyl did the trick to improve solubility and eliminate CYP3A4 liability (that and one atom on the heterocycle). Anyway, ATR is part of DNA damage repair. You’ve probably heard of it from Vertex, who sold their VX-970 to Merck KgaA (now M-6620 or berzosertib) for a pretty penny. I don’t trust anything from Vertex Cambridge drug discovery (including and especially Derek Lowe). So far I don’t think anyone is bowled over by the data for ATRs–no monotherapy efficacy. There’s a Bayer compound out there, too. It seems like the AZ predecessor compound was around for a while.

Basic rheumatologic/CTD evaluation?,"I'm training in an area essentially without Rheumatology access. The two somewhat local Rheumatologists are so swamped that they will only see patients who fit the textbook picture with both the clinical presentation and lab work. Even with that rule they are still booked 3 months out, sometimes even 5-6 months out. I have had patients both in the hospital and in my clinic who appear to have some sort of connective tissue disease but do not have labs that support a specific diagnosis, so I suppose they fall under undifferentiated mixed connective tissue disorder (which the Rheumatology clinic won't see). The Rheumatologists also have stricter cut offs for some positive tests than we do; for example, ANA Titer will flag as positive at my institution at 1:64 but the Rheumatologist doesn't consider this a positive result. Many of these patients are frustrated with the confusion between a positive/negative cut off and lack of answers for what is causing their symptoms. Since a lot of these rheum/connective tissue disease labs are not black and white, I'm at a loss for how to best serve my patients. I want to do as much of the basic work up as possible to ease the burden on Rheum, but sometimes I end up chasing ""gray area"" labs with more labs that confuse the picture more. It's become a huge time sink for me.

Creative Options for Medical Waiting Room,"Doctors out there with successful creative waiting room setups, this is a two part question.

TWO:
I am specifically considering setting up a large screen in the waiting room, and perhaps some in the exam rooms as well. The screens would be programmed to present a random series of images ranging from infographics with “fun facts” pertaining to our field alternating with calming images of scenery and cute animals and inspirational messages and Reddit memes (just kidding). **Can someone assist with the hardware and software logistics of how best to do that?** I am guessing large screen TV’s set up to mirror a computer.

Starting a solo practice (husband’s POV),"I’m the husband of a fiercely intelligent woman who also happens to be an ob/gyn. Last year she quit working for the doctor she’s been with since finishing residency to start her own solo practice. I also work full time but try to help her with various aspects of her business in my free time. It has a whirlwind of a year but we are both surprised by how positive things have turned out so far. 

Running a solo practice was an idea she would have scoffed at when she was in her residency and looking for a job. We live in an expensive coastal city. Most of her friends went to work for one of the large hospital systems and a few went into academics. Doctors are quite the risk adverse type of people given on my own impressions.

It helps that her patients love her and many followed her when she moved. She kept her hospital privilege and the new office was just around the corner, so patients probably didn’t mind much. Volumes were low in the beginning but we also kept the expenses low. I built her a website using WIX so we avoided paying expensive web designers. We spend about $500 a month for Google AdWords, which has really helped grown her pt volumes organically. The biggest expense each month is rent. But everything else is pretty manageable. It also boggled my mind how little MAs get paid: we received dozens of resumes overnight after posting the opening for a job that pays on average $16 an hour. How do they afford to live in an expensive city like this one?

Changes to her lifestyle have been both good and bad. She dictates her own hours now, which are nearly the same as before. But she doesn’t have anyone to share calls with, so we can’t take vacations or so much visit friends that live more than 2 hours drive away. 

We are now in the process of buying a medical office space instead of keep renting, so her patients can find her in a more permanent location. There are so many older doctors looking to retire but so few young ones want to buy their own commercial space that the dynamics are working greatly in our favor. We keep getting offers from seller that would never happen for the residential real estate market here. However we are struggling a bit to find a bank that will lend to us at a reasonable rate because the practice doesn’t have that long of a history.

Things are going well so far and I’m proud of my gal. She works hard but is also notably happier being on her own. Helping her, sometimes we fight over difference in opinions, especially at times when I feel like my efforts are under-appreciated. But overall I enjoy the work I do for her and this past year has brought us closer and made our marriage stronger.

Is there a different view on the use of medicine in the US?,"I moved to the US from Scandinavia a couple of years ago and I’m trying to figure out if I just happened to end up in a location (CA) and with a crowd of people who look on the use of medicine very differently than from where I come from.

A few examples.

Flu shots. You are strongly encouraged to get it every flu season and can practically get a needle in your arm at Ralphs while waiting for your ground beef to be packed up right next to you. If I’m not mistaken I have no memory or knowledge about people back home where they regularly take flu shots. People get sick, but in my experience not more than over here and that’s even a cold climate. I’m really not an anti-vaxxer, but this mentality of almost everyone I’ve met taking flu shots is new to me. And that even newborns get it. It’s also new to me that parents wont even let anyone meet their infants if they haven’t taken the shot. For reference I took the flu shot this season and I’ve had two severe cases of the flu already anyway. I know, no guarantees, but would I’ve had more than two without it?!

TDAP for adults. Again I’m really pro vaccine, but here you’re recommended to take a TDAP shot every 5 years or 2 years if you’re expecting to be around a newborn and with every pregnancy if you’re an expecting mom. I definitely may be wrong but I have no knowledge of people taking TDAPs as adults in Europe, even if expecting. My wife and her doctor told my mom to take the shot at least 2 weeks before travelling over here if she wanted to be near our newborn son and she was very surprised, already having 3 grandkids and working with children every day her whole life. Her doctor was also surprised that she asked for a booster shot to be able to meet her grandson and basically laughed and said ”that’s a new one”.

Advil/Tylenol/pills. Here they seem to take it with their morning coffee and you can buy them at every corner. My wife’s family reaches for a pill as soon as a symptom of anything at all occures and they’re fast to give the drop version of it and gels etc to babies if they suspect teething or any kind of ache or fussiness. Peoples medicine drawers seem to be fuller here and the pills come in dozens of different shapes, strenghts and day/night versions.

Prescriptions. I went to my first wellness checkup when I bought health insurance. I was feeling fine but after the first visit I was prescribed a nasal spray to take every week and an every day thyriod medicine for the rest of my life, that I pay for downstairs from the same health insurance company. They may be right but I’ve been on it since and I don’t feel any difference at all for an issue I didn’t know I had.

So, what is different and why don’t they need all of this in Europe (if my observation is correct)? Is it just a very high risk elimination or is there a greater economical agenda in play?",medicine,1548176117,seabasse,0,1,True,2019-01-22
Realistic time frame for breast cancer investigations?,"Hi there,

My mom is 55 and has a 4-5cm lump in one breast. Ultrasound was ordered by gp and there were some concerning features, vascularization, and the radiologist gave it a birads  of 5. Previous mammogram normal 18months ago. No family history, remote smoking history, premenopausal, used combined ocp for 20+ years, no other medical history. 

We got to see the breast surgeon in two weeks  and after reviewing and examining, jumps to explaining that neoadj chemo is probably needed before any surgery (if it's cancer). Then Initially, they scheduled a diagnostic mammogram for 4 weeks later. 4 weeks? Isn't that kind of a long time?

My mom was obviously upset and her husband pushed for an explanation and earlier date  and got a mammogram for 4 days later. And a biopsy a week after that. All of this took a lot of pushing and persistence from our end.

At the moment, the biopsy is being done today and a nuclear bone scan for 3 weeks later. 

My mom has been complaining of progressive thoracic and lumbar back pain that's worsened over the last 6 months, so our concern is obviously whether it's metastasized or not. There's no talk of CT or MRI,just the bone scan in a few weeks. So what is the typical course of action here? Are they waiting for the biopsy results to confirm cancer before getting imaging? Because from what I understand, pathology takes about 10 days, then outpatient imaging scheduling maybe another week or so...

I graduate in May and my mom really wants to come see my graduation. Flight from home to where I study is about 8 hours so it's hard for her since she thinks she's convinced she's dying and not getting any answers. 

1. So is it just our unfamiliarity with diagnostic time-frames or is there something wrong with this hospital? The surgeon has said one thing to our faces and it seems like it doesn't translate to what actually happens. 

2. Alk phos is normal, but no calcium levels done. XR of spine shows degenerative changes. Is this enough to reassure docs that there really aren't any spinal Mets? All other labs are normal, chest xr normal

Tldr: mom has breast lump birads 5,back pain, and worried about Mets. Should we be? What is the time frame for cancer diagnosis workup? A few weeks? Months?

Question for those with experience in colonoscopy and polypectomy,"Hi there,

I’m doing an engineering project that requires me to come up with an innovation related to colonic polypectomy. I was wondering, if you have any experience in undertaking such procedures, can you give me some insight as to what you think could be better / what frustrates you when performing this? 

When retrieving large polyps, say with a Roth net type of device, how do you find it? If a polyp doesn’t fit into the suction channel, how do you tackle it? Would it be feasible to have something that would compress the polyp so it would fit into the suction channel?

Do you have any experience with distal attachment devices such as the endocuff? If so, what is your opinion on them? Do you think they’re finicky or more hassle than they’re worth? 

When you encounter a poorly prepped portion of the bowel, is it difficult to clean and eradicate residue? How do you improve visualization? 

Do you find switching between polypectomy tools such as forceps and snares annoying or is it something that is inconsequential? 

I would appreciate any insight you may have. Just your opinion, frustrations and experience from the point of view of the operator.",medicine,1548201678,carpediem2106,0,1,True,2019-01-22

Nicotine and diabetes,"I don't use nicotine nor am I suggesting anyone should. I am just hoping to spark an objective conversation about it because of the rise in vaping. Note, I think vaping is tacky and wish people would stop because of the unknown harmful long term effects. 

Less than one percent of people had either type of diabetes in the late 50s. A lot of factors play into this but could the decline in smoking play a role? 

See https://imgur.com/a/iChaCLk for the long term trends by the CDC. Note the dip in the mid 90s.

Now the same long term trend in smoking prevalence. Notice a spike somewhere in the 90s? https://imgur.com/a/QWJUVHQ

Smoking increases 24-h energy expenditure by ~10%18 and increases energy expenditure more during exercise and after eating than while at rest. A 10% increase in metabolic rate, corresponding to an expenditure of 200 kcal per 24 h, seems small; however, assuming that there is no change in caloric intake, this increase in energy expenditure caused by nicotine can result in the loss of 10 kg in body weight over 1 year.

Adult smokers weigh, on average, 4–5 kg less than nonsmokers, are less likely to be overweight or obese, and tend to gain weight when they quit smoking.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195407/

Not suggesting that is the sole factor in the obesity rate but as smoking declined, diabetes skyrocketed. That's not great evidence but it's certainly an interesting association. Vaping is a big unknown but it's possible it may not be as harmful as we might think. Nicotine certainly has many potential risks. 

What are your thoughts? I'm obviously not qualified to assess this stuff.

I don’t know if I strained a heart muscle or blocked an artery,"I need help figuring this situation out because I’m really nervous and I might be everywhere when explaining my situation 

So recently, I’ve been eating unhealthy late at night. And out of nowhere I felt this sharp pain in my heart but it’s only present if I lay down in a certain position or move my arm in a specific way. 

But just in case, I looked it up and websites said I might have a blocked artery and it’s freaking me out. I mean the symptoms for a blocked heart artery don’t match what’s going on with me for the most part.

Like I don’t feel dizzy (unless I don’t eat for the whole day), I don’t sweat (unless I walk to school which is about a mile away and I wear a big jacket), and I only feel sleepy when I have only a few hours of sleep and I’m in class.

But at the same time this pain has been present for 2 days and my pinky on my left arm feels sleepy or tight (it’s this weird sensation where I don’t feel it).

But at the same time websites are saying I might’ve strained a muscle and the symptoms do match with me for that where I feel sharp pain if I move my arm a certain way.

Acute Otitis Media in Children: My Approach,"A common sentiment I hear from physicians who see acute cases (FP, ED, Peds) is that they feel that parents expect antibiotics for children with acute otitis media (AOM).  I'd like to share my approach to these cases.  I'm a primary care pediatrician in a suburban/semi-rural facility (USA) with an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population.  I see \~4,000 patients per year.  In a typical year, I will prescribe antibiotics to treat AOM maybe 6-7 times (yes, it's \*that\* rare since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).  I have never had a case in which a child had a poor outcome due to a missed diagnosis.  

Parental awareness of acute otitis media is very high.  In the United States, I think that most American parents have a cultural bias towards suspicion of AOM.  I frequently hear complaints such as: ""She's been touching her ear for a month.  I think she might have an ear infection,"" or ""My mother-in-law said that he tugged his ears yesterday and said I should get him checked for an ear infection.""  Obviously, children do not have untreated AOM for a month and AOM is a very uncomfortable condition for the child.    


It's important to understand the diagnosis.  The information that I am going to give comes mostly from the 2013 AAP Guidelines on AOM and it \*only applies to children over 60 days of age.\*  Going back to our first year of medical school, we recall that acute focal infections present with four signs: CALOR, RUBOR, TUMOR, and (most importantly) DOLOR.  If the child has no ear complaint, then the child does not have AOM.  I frequently see completely healthy children being put on antibiotics for an ""incidental finding"" of AOM on presentation for an unrelated complaint (examination after motor vehicle accident, for example).  AOM is never an occult process.  There will be a history of ear pain or discomfort.  Sometimes the pain resolves if the TM ruptures, but then there will be a complaint of drainage.  

If a child screams loudly enough, the TM will become erythematous.  This hyperemia is not inflammation.  The TM with AOM is OPAQUE, DULL, and has EFFACED LANDMARKS.  Sometimes, it's more white than red.  If pneumatic otoscopy is available, you will see decreased mobility of the TM.  A red TM or an air/fluid level alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis. 

Before I even look in the ear of a child with a complaint of otalgia (ear pain), I first *get the history* and then I review the AAP guidelines for treatment with the parents.  This is what I call ""expectation management.""  I explain it to them very much like I explain it to my medical students.

""Before I look in your child's ear, I want to discuss ear infections and what the American Academy of Pediatrics has to say about them.  First, between 90 and 95% of ear infections are caused by viruses, and those won't respond to antibiotics and usually go away in less than two days.  So if I were to give antibiotics to every kid with an ear infection, I'd have to give 10-20 kids antibiotics to make one kid better, which isn't a very good number.  (note: most parents are aware that antibiotics are not without their risks).

""In order to bring that number down to somewhere between 2 and 4, I follow a set of rules laid out by the AAP.  I'll start your child on antibiotics if:

1. The ear pain has been present for more than 48 hours.\*
2. The ear pain is not responding to appropriate doses of Tylenol or Motrin (*note: parents usually under-dose because they follow the instructions on the box.  The manufacturers of these medications very responsibly tend to guess low on their dosing recommendations so as to avoid overdoses.  Ask the parents what dose they are using*).  
3. The child is under 6mo.
4. The ear drum has ruptured and there is pus leaking out.
5. There is a temperature of 102.5F or higher.
6. Your child has special risk factors, such as being an organ transplant patient or having ear tubes or something like that.

""So let me have a look...""

\*Note: if the pain has not been present for 48 hours, then I say: ""And in your case, it hasn't been 48 hours, so if there is an ear infection, I'll give you a kind of prescription called a 'wait-and-see' prescription for antibiotics that can't be filled until (48 hours after they said the pain began).  That way, you don't have to come back if he doesn't improve.  In the mean time, if the pain should get worse and stop responding to pain medication, you can call us and we'll approve an earlier fill on the antibiotic.""

  
For wait-and-see prescriptions, I put ""WAIT-AND-SEE RX.  PLEASE DO NOT FILL BEFORE 5PM ON 1/25/19"" in the instructions.  I set the expiration date for the prescription for one week after the visit date.

Please stop saying that most acute otitis media is viral.,"This came up in a recent popular post here and I think it deserves attention in and of itself since it is something I hear all the time echoed by residents and other providers. The implication is that viruses are the sole pathogen in the middle ear and that we do not need to treat them.   We know that viruses are very important in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Respiratory viruses that cause common colds result in eustachian tube dysfunction that then result in the overgrowth of bacteria in the middle ear cavity. But MOST cases of acute otitis media are in fact cause by bacteria or bacteria and viruses together.   Here is the break down based on conventional and molecular diagnostics:  Bacteria alone- 27%,  Bacteria+virus - 66% , VIRUSES ALONE- 4% and no pathogen - 4 %.  Here are two sources ( reviews of the topic  from leaders in the field) where this came from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3305843/, https://cmr.asm.org/content/cmr/16/2/230.full.pdf. Yes viruses are detected in the majority of cases but bacteria are present in most as well.   While I support judicious use of antibiotics for otitis media and in many cases watchful waiting or delayed prescribing is a good thing.  The evidence for benefit of antibiotics is not great, (/www.cochrane.org/CD000219/ARI_antibiotics-for-acute-middle-ear-infection-acute-otitis-media-in-children) but that may have to do with factors much different than having a viral etiology.

"Rant on sensitivity and the ""must rule-out"" culture in medicine","This post might be a bit nerdy, but I want to get something off my chest that has bothered me for some time and see if others can relate. It is a long, and possibly disorganized rant, but I hope it generates some discussion.

I feel as if the scientific concept of ""accuracy"" in medicine is broken. There are clinical situations where accuracy is intuitive and there are others where I think it holds back progress and very likely causes harm to patients and health care systems. I will illustrate with some examples, specifically comparing the ideas of accuracy as they relate to diagnosis and prognosis. My bias is emergency medicine, so will use scenarios relevant to my field. But I think there are probably examples in most if not all areas of clinical medicine. We all deal with uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Diagnostic Test Accuracy

I get diagnostic test accuracy. When you look at diagnostic test accuracy studies, they are generally designed as follows:

P - Population of interest (e.g. adults presenting to ED following traumatic ankle pain)

I - Index test (e.g. [Ottawa Ankle Rule](https://www.mdcalc.com/ottawa-ankle-rule))

R - Reference test (e.g. X-ray)

T - Target condition (e.g. clinically important ankle and midfoot fractures)

""PIRT"" is the mnemonic to remember for the basic design of a diagnostic test accuracy study. With diagnostic accuracy study designs, the reference test is usually represented by the gold standard or clinical standard (i.e. pragmatic) test. In emergency medicine, we are not routinely getting CT scans or MRIs on patients with ankle trauma and so it seems reasonable to compare something like the Ottawa Ankle Rule to the real-world clinical standard, which is X-ray. Although the Ottawa Ankle Rule represents a set of clinical criteria, rather than an investigation or test in the traditional sense, it can still be conceptualized as a test because we are comparing (with X-ray) its ability to accurately distinguish between fractures and non-fractures.

The rationale for using something like the Ottawa Ankle Rule is that as a clinician, I could potentially avoid an X-ray and the radiation exposure (minimal, I know) and cost to the health care system that comes with that test. This might be more helpful if you are working in a low resource or over-crowded setting or in a setting where you do not have easy/immediate access to X-ray.

2. Prognostic Test Accuracy

In contrast, I really struggle with the concept of accuracy when looking at a *prognostic* clinical question. Take for example patients presenting to the ED with chest pain. This is a tricky population. In some cases, the cause is obvious, but in many, it is not. So for those patients where it is not and we have considered a cardiac etiology possible, as a clinician, it might be helpful if there was a way to accurately identify those patients who will and will not sustain an adverse outcome in the not so distant future. Take, for example, the [HEART score](https://www.mdcalc.com/heart-score-major-cardiac-events):

P - Patients presenting to ED with chest pain, possibly cardiac in origin

I - HEART score

R - ???

T - Major adverse cardiac events (a composite outcome, encompassing death, myocardial infarction and unanticipated revascularization by PCI or CABG) within 6 weeks

A recent [systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30375097) on the HEART score evaluated its ""prognostic accuracy"". This study found that for patients with HEART 0-3, the sensitivity in predicting major adverse cardiac events was 95.9%.

So, looking at PIRT above, how does one both conceptually and mathematically arrive at a sensitivity of 95.9%? By definition, when generating your 2x2 table, you are comparing the index and reference tests. So in this study design, what is the reference test? If you work out the numbers, the authors are using the outcome itself as the reference test in calculating the sensitivity and specificity. So, in essence, the test here is the ""test"" of time. Conceptually, this is a bit of a head scratcher for me and and is nowhere near as intuitive as the example above with the Ottawa Ankle Rule, where the question is diagnostic and the outcome is distinct from the reference test. It also raises several methodological concerns, namely incorporation, verification and spectrum biases, which are described [here](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-018-0816-4) and elaborated on a bit below, too.

Try explaining the concept of sensitivity, in this context, to a patient or colleague over the phone. By definition, it means that for those patients who go on to sustain a major adverse cardiac event, 95.9% of them will be identified by the HEART score. It does not mean we have ""ruled out"" ACS or ""ruled out"" a future major adverse cardiac event. Unless we achieve 100% sensitivity, there is no ruling out of anything.

Look at the studies included in this meta-analysis, and you will note that there is quite a range of sensitivities. For example, there is an included [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21989033) with a sensitivity of 58%. Why is this? Certainly, at the bedside, it is not as helpful to tell your patient: in those patients who go on to sustain a major adverse cardiac event, 58% of them will be identified by the HEART score. That doesn't sound very good. So why the discrepancy?

I was taught in medical school that the sensitivity of a test does not change with prevalence of disease in a population and that this is why we prefer it to predictive values when evaluating the accuracy/usefulness of a test. And this is likely true for things like a blood test, where a computer spits out a number and there is no human interpretation involved.

So why the discrepancy with the HEART score? The likely answer here is [spectrum bias](https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article/25/5/390/443697). Spectrum bias acknowledges the possibility that shifts in prevalence may be at least in part due to case mix variation among study populations. Case mix variation can impact the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios of a given test. For example, if you are a Radiologist working in a location with very high rates of TB, your interpretation of or approach to chest X-rays might differ from a Radiologist working in a location where pulmonary TB is exceedingly rare.

It is worth pointing out that despite the seemingly poor sensitivity of 58%, only 0.6% of patients with HEART score 0-3 went on to sustain a major adverse cardiac event. So here, it would seem that the estimate of risk (or predictive value) of the ""test"" is far more intuitive and helpful at the bedside. In my view, the concept of risk is much easier to explain to a patient (or a colleague over the phone) than the concept of sensitivity.

We often try to apply the concept of accuracy to non-binary clinical scenarios. Chest pain, coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome are somewhat nebulous and on a spectrum. This is the reality of most things in clinical medicine, from diabetes to hypertension, COPD and heart failure. Sure there are those clear-cut STEMIs and classic anginas, but when we get into things like NSTEMI and unstable angina, it becomes far less clear what is actually going on with the patient. Is there a plaque rupture? Is there an obstructive lesion in the coronary artery that we are now for the first time detecting clinically, due to the patient presenting with bad sepsis or rapid atrial fibrillation or deciding to go to the gym for the first time in a while? We don't want to send home patients with those unstable lesions, but presumably, we are able to identify them through ongoing chest pain in the ED, ECG changes or a positive troponin. So how do we rationally decide on what we are going to do with everyone else?

I don't think the answer is sensitivity and specificity. Why? Well, test accuracy is really only a useful construct when we have a binary clinical question (e.g. is the patient pregnant or not pregnant or, as in the example above, does the patient have a clinically important fracture we wouldn't want to miss?).

Why do you think we develop risk score after risk score for conditions like chest pain/ACS? The reason is that we do not have a clear gold standard or pragmatic way of ruling out the condition (or the severity of the condition). The reason for this is because it is not a binary condition or disease, but a syndrome on a [spectrum](https://twitter.com/medicalaxioms/status/1088561850273259520). So in this situation, I believe the far more useful way to look at the problem is, let's see if we can use a set of clinical (demographics, medical history, presenting symptoms) +/- investigative criteria troponin, ECG) to estimate a patient's risk (i.e. prognosis) of a patient-centred outcome. Can we reliably identify those who are at low risk? And once we identify those who are at low risk, can we then evaluate the relative merits (e.g. resource utilization, measures of quality, patient-centred care) of care pathways that might follow?

In the chest pain patient in the ED, whose chest pain has resolved, has a normal ECG and negative troponin/troponins, this often comes down to: what do I do with the patient now? Do I do a stress test? Maybe my patient would benefit more from addressing known risk factors for coronary artery disease. Bottom line is, we will never be able to begin to address these clinical questions and involve the patient in the shared decision-making process unless we move away from this ""rule out"" culture that exists in medicine and transition to a culture that accepts, no ***EMBRACES***, risk as inevitable and attempts to identify those risk cohorts can benefit from potential diagnostic tests or interventions. Because low risk patients do go on to have false positive provocative cardiac testing, and some of them will go on to have an angiogram, and have a stroke or even die in the cath lab. Yet we feel good about ourselves and think we are doing no harm when we send the patient with GERD down that pathway.

How to improve clinic visit efficiency and preventing loss to follow up?,"Planning to go into primary care and was hoping to get some advice on how people structure their patient encounters.  I'm not sure if it's just because it's resident clinic and we're afraid patients won't come back/live far away/can't afford to come, but I find myself addressing 2-3 acute problems plus 2-3 chronic problems or more each visit plus potentially tobacco/obesity/etc counseling and health maintenance review.  I don't think this is entirely possible in the real world with shorter visits.

How many acute and chronic problems do you address in a visit?  How do you reconcile the patient's priorities vs your priorities (esp if their 4th acute complaint is actually the most medically concerning)? 

Also would appreciate advice on how you remember to follow up on things that may not come up as a notification in the EMR - for example, if you order a CT scan for a possible nodule on a CXR and they never get the CT scan (so I never get the notification) and never make a follow up appointment until 2 years later when it's metastatic lung cancer.

For primarily outpatient-based doctors: did you enjoy clinic in medical school?,"Hey friends - I'm a MS3 who was initially set on ophtho but during third year found out I do not enjoy clinic after my ophtho elective. I did a little clinic during IM and surgery which I didn't enjoy either but blamed it on bad preceptors, not knowing or not being interested in FM or whatever specialty clinic it is. Now I can't tell how much of my dislike of outpatient medicine is just me being burnt out from 3rd year in general vs truly not liking clinic. I posted in /r/medicalschool about this and a couple people mentioned how clinic really sucks ass as a student and can be better enjoyed as a resident or attending.

It's hard for me to verbalize what I don't like about it, but it comes down to a couple of things. First is the speed, just having to see so many patients. I don't know anything about the patient and having to juggle navigating EMR while building rapport while thinking about what to ask next / ddx / tx is unpleasant. This is exacerbated by minimal or no time beforehand to read up, think about pertinent ROS to ask etc. And then also little time afterwards to prepare a presentation. I'm also more introverted and can't just speak well off the cuff, so my presentations are usually trash.

I've enjoyed having my couple inpatients during IM, since I had time to get the story from ED resident, think about a potential ddx, and then go and interview. And then I got all day to prepare notes &amp; presentations for the attending.

How to Manage With Patient's Who Disagree with You,"Hi r/medicine

I am looking for some advice that you may have in how to help the patient and yourself in these situations. I basically had a rather unpleasant interaction with a patient a few days ago and it has left me feeling upset and I just can't shake this feeling. I will keep this brief to try and keep the case resonable general, but I also want to provide some context.

Classic first time mother with a 'colicky' baby. I would classify it as a mild case as the main issue was some spilling and short periods of crying. Mum had been taking the baby to a different doctor who had done a workup, come to the same conclusion, offered advice and close monitoring and had seen them 3-4 times in the last few weeks. The spills were becoming less and less and the baby was gaining weight well. That doctor had been reluctant to prescribe a PPI.

...So I am guessing that is why baby was brought to me. I did a full a full workup again, and discussing management again and offering encouragement in that things were looking good with the weight gain and mum was doing really well. However, mum ""knows"" this is not ""just colick"" (implying I was saying that there is nothing wrong with her baby) and that she knows ""something else is going on.""

I was then pressured into prescribing the PPI, even after explaining that things were improving as they were and that there is little evidence of their efficacy, as well as the small potential for harms.

I am left feeling really down. I feel that my professional opinion has been trampled on the floor. I feel coerced into prescribing against best evidence and with the potential for harm. It's hard to not let this affect me and I feel the feeling of worthlessness bleeds over to my other patient's and I start to feel like they wont trust me either. I also feel like I was a pushover.

Incredibly, through some talk with some friends and others, it seems quite common that people assume they have unlimited time with the doctor and they don't piece together that spending 30 minutes in a 20-minute appointment results in the doctor being late for the rest of the appointments!

How do you guys deal with this or convey this message to patients? I have a friend whose partner uses an audible countdown timer, but that seems a bit tacky. . .",medicine,1548681769,kukukele,50,1,True,2019-01-28
What are the main hindrances to adding more residency spots to match the increased demand for physicians?,"I am curious on the main hindrances to adding more residency positions when they are in such high demand. My understanding is that residency slots are funded from the government. I suggest combating the cost of residency by offering slots in primary care that offer half the salary or highly reduced salary.  I imagine that there are many people who would do residency for half pay or even free.

I feel the whole interview process needs to change. It cost many potential candidates lots of money for interviews that are fruitless. I propose that programs do a video interview before even inviting candidates for a face to face interview. Many jobs in the private sector have 2-3 rounds of interviews before selecting a proper candidate.  I wonder how I can make serious proposals for change in this archaic system.

Acute Bronchitis - to abx or not that is the question,"Before I get destroyed because of the title, I understand from PA school, UpToDate and pretty much all the medical references that I have that most cases of bronchitis are viral and don’t need to be treated with abx with the exception of the patients you suspect with pertussis causing that cough. 

As most clinicians know there are variances in how patients are treated in books versus real life.  A little backstory, I worked as a PA at an UC where it became very hard to argue/manage patients who came in with bronchitis that they didn’t need abx. I felt like I was fighting a losing battle because the other MD,PA,NP would pretty much always write for them no matter how long it’s been (not talking about the patients with colds who left with abx which is another story). It’s hard to argue with the older patients who have for years had “rounds” of antibiotics for bronchitis that today they didn’t need it. I always found younger patients were more willing to listen. 

My question is if there are ever indications for antibiotics for say an elderly patient (65yo, 70, 80) with multiple comorbidities like HTN, HLD, diabetes, CHF etc to be put on abx for just those reasons or not... because it’s viral and not needed/not alter the course...because it uncommonly turns to pneumonia. Not talking about COPDers.

What is the point of ordering a urine culture for a patient with suspected UTI in the setting of Urgent Care or ED?,"From what I've gathered working in these setting, the midlevel or doctor will order urine culture if a patient has positive leukocytes or nitrites in their urine.

What is the point if the patient is going to get a script for antibiotics days before the results of the urine culture comes back? When they do get the results of the culture back, does this ever alter the treatment course? 

I'm also confused because I believe I read somewhere that UTI is a clinical diagnosis; if history and physical exam point towards UTI, then the patient likely has a UTI regardless of what the urinalysis or urine culture says.

Why don't we have a Patient-centric EHR System?,"My background is in Biomedical Informatics and I plan to pursue a PhD in the field soon. As such, I've been wondering about a probably naive question recently, but why don't we have better EHR systems? Ideally, we would have one that focused on patients and allowed for easy configuration of clinician workflows leading to a comprehensive and easily searchable medical record. 

Some reasons I know of: 

1. EHRs come from claims software systems, which have been adapted to hold patient information with a generally business goal in mind. 
2. Clinicians at different hospital systems have very distinct workflows and companies like Epic go for a One-size-fits-all approach (generally).
3. There is little reason for interoperability since most large software companies increase profits by creating patient data silos.
4. It is difficult to get clinicians, patients, management, other stakeholders to buy-in to a new system.

My Hemophilia Improved - Drastically. Please Help Me Find Out Why,"So I was born with Hemophilia A, 3% severity, which means I had grown accustomed to certain things throughout my life which I’m sure many of you are aware of. Small bruises turned into massive bruises, target joints such as my ankles, elbows, and especially hips bled regularly. I had to treat at home, spent weeks in the hospital at times, etc. I also developed a dependence to pain killers that turned into a serious heroin addiction. 

However about 3 years ago, when I got sober and stayed sober, I started changing my lifestyle drastically as far as diet and exercise goes - I included fruits and veggies into my life every day, cooked for myself most of the time (about 90-95% of meals), and exercised by lifting weights about 3-4 days a week. 

I went to my hematologist 2 years ago for my annual checkup and my factor levels were up to 11%. We thought it was a mistake so we took the tests again a few months later, this time my levels were at like 15%. We took the test again a few months later and they were still in the teens. 

My bleeds are few and far between now, and never drastic. I haven’t needed more than 2 days to recover from a joint bleed in over 3 years. I just got what SHOULD have been a super big bruise on my leg and it’s already started disappearing after 2 days. 

Has anybody else had these results happen to them? I would discount it to genetics but I have two brothers with Hemophilia - one has stayed the same (3% severity) and the other has developed inhibitors, and has thus become quite disabled. I know that this is not definitive proof that genetics plays the predominant role in my escalating factor levels, but it does hint that something environmental is correlated with this. 

My doctor has no clue what is happening and encouraged me to contact outside resources to try and solve this puzzle. Does anyone know what is happening? And if not, can anyone direct me towards a medical community or doctor who may be able to explain what is going on? I’ve never heard of this and neither has my doctor but I’m curious for more information.

Question about UK Medical School,"Hi Guys/Gals.

Wordy one here so I'm sorry about that. \[Also Mods plz don't delete, I fraudulently used the wrong flair, soz about that\]

I believe I have an excellent knowledge of medicine for a non-doctor. Even going as far as writing a science based book on Low Testosterone in modern men, failures I observed in Testosterone testing procedure and lifestyle factors determining male hormones.

I've had Crohn's for 8 years and, unfortunately, was prone to massive rectal bleeds prior to my hemicolectemy. I nearly died at 17 due to massive blood loss in excess of 2.5 litres. After this time, my medical treatment seemed to move too slowly for me, I was frustrated at the bureaucracy of my treatment, and fully believed I didn't have enough time for GP's, consultants and HCP's to ""go through the motions"" and treat me, I felt I needed to have control over my own condition, and be my own first line doctor or else another massive bleed would kill me, while I was still awaiting appointments or etc.

This pushed me into informally and obsessively studying medicine myself, which is now going on over 8 years.

I bought Tranexamic Acid from online veterinarian suppliers. I overhauled my lifestyle to take me out of the at risk groups for severe Crohn's Complications, I talked with leading experts on IBD to build up a working theory of the possible causes and mechanisms of the disease (Why the immune system seemingly attacks the bowels) (Could go on forever about that) and after convincing Dr's to trial me on different drugs have now been happily in complete remission from Severe CD for 2 years. I deal with my own flare ups, using the working theory I touched on above.

I also have PTSD, of which I suspected chronic elevated Cortisol were playing a part (Low testosterone, exhaustion, memory problems) this was confirmed in bloods. I convinced the Dr to prescribe Mirtazapine which I'm now, thankfully, doing great on.

I could go on and on, I can tell you about xenoestrogens, vitamin D deficiencies, andropause etc etc.

I regularly get asked by Doctors if I'm a med student during appointments.

**Also I'm aware I sound like the** ***worst*** **kind of patient and I bet you run into people that sound like me everyday. Reading all that back I sound like a conceited arsehole, but I'm not going to edit it for the sake of sincerity.**

The point I'm getting at, is I have what at-least *seems* to be a much greater understanding of medicine than the average non-professional. I'm laughably the de-facto Dr for my group of friends for issues they can't be bothered, or are too embarrassed to go to a GP about, (I always tell them to go to the Dr's don't worry). In fact I'm pretty sure I could give you the first line treatments for any common ailment you might mention. My passion is for the medical field, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

**The sticking point is** I have no A Levels in the sciences due to a really chaotic youth and behavioural problems. Yet I really think I could excel at being a Doctor if trained, the passion certainly is there, and at least a rudimentary base of knowledge too. The only thing I can fall back on is straight A's in my GCSE's.

**TL;DR**

**I think i'm a smarty pants at medicine, because I have severe CD and basically have read a literal shit-tonne of medical papers, university course books and medical handbooks. I want to work in medicine, but look like a dumb dumb because I don't have any A Levels because mummy and daddy fought a lot.**

Is my level of medical knowledge even as great as I think it is?

No I've never watched House M.D

How do I proceed?

What should I expect?

I'm concerned my PTSD and sleep problems might impede my training.

I'm a third year surgical resident.

My intern does the following:

He confabulates when he isn't sure. Doesn't say I don't know and ends up giving false or altered facts.

He's distracted most of the time. Doesn't pay attention to what other people are saying.

He doesn't confirm what is told to him and ends up doing something else then he gets defensive when he's questioned about it.

"Study of ""grit"" when the examiner is unreliable","I am trying to find a study that I read a few years ago. It was a follow-up to that famous one where children were asked to delay a reward (one candy) to receive a greater reward (two candies).

I am looking for the *follow-up* study where the examiner was unreliable (broke promises), and the children with ""grit"" suddenly didn't have grit. They found that the rational behavior of taking a bird-in-the-hand won out. The conclusion was that the ability to delay gratification is a learned ability, and it is learned best in environments when outcomes can be reliable predicted (i.e. delaying one candy *guarantees* two in the future).

My main question was weather I should give up textbooks altogether and go with review articles on each topic? but then I am not sure if I am missing things.

I'm a new respiratory therapist and need help with coping with the stresses of working in an ICU.,"I'm a fairly new respiratory therapist having been working for about two years in a Newborn Intensive Care Unit. These past few weeks have been very hard. I personally withdrew on three patients and have known three more that I didn't personally withdraw on but knew the patient and their families very well. These are not the first patients I have withdrawn on but they have been weighing heavy on my mind and making me think about how I have been coping and I'm not sure if I have been doing very well. I think I have been not wanting to talk about it and just bottling the emotions up and in doing so I have been bottling up other emotions and stresses that come with everyday life. My fiance has expressed to me that she feels like she knows me less now than she did just a couple of years ago because I don't talk about my feelings or really anything serious anymore. It's like as if I put up this joking facade and anytime anything serious is brought up in everyday life I just brush it off and make light of it. I know I need to talk more about what happens in the NICU but I don't feel like anyone understands it. They will just say oh that sucks and move on to another subject. When I talk to coworkers about it all I ever get is ""Well you shoulda been here when so-and-so died now that was sad"" and they launch into their own stories and I'm left with hearing their emotions and not getting any of mine out. My fiance is actually a good listener but she isn't in the same field as me and doesn't have the same life or death situations I have to deal with. I have to do a lot of explaining of certain situations and terms and I'm left with focusing more on explaining a given a situation than I am expressing my feelings and so I give up. I feel like this giving up on expressing myself has really spilled over to other emotions I face and I'm left with just bottling it up and pushing it away.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to stay working in a NICU. I love the patients. I love the nurses I work with. I love the families I encounter. I love the deep relationships I form with my families and coworkers.

Infectious disease reading,"ID experts, what would you recommend as a starter for someone interested to learn more about ID?

That really goes back to the basics but in a clinically relevant manner. That goes to the simple things that common people misunderstand or get wrong. There’s a lot of stuff I pickup by hearsay from my ID people but I want to be able to say I heard it from somewhere other than so and so.

Addressing questions such as:

How to interpret if a culture is just colonisation or a real infection (based on the identified bug itself, how the culture was taken, the culture count, other labs like CRP, that procal is only validated in Respiratory infection, symptoms and signs) and therefore whether to treat or not

Things like ESBL and Amp-Cs. For example, first heard about the merino-1 trial from reddit and learnt that you shouldn’t use Pip-Tazo to treat ESBL organisms. But I also learnt from my local ID peeps that this applies only to bacteremic patients because of the trial, and they don’t consider this to extrapolate to treatment of non-lifethhreatening (even if limb threatening) infectious like osteomyelitis. I had a patient with a ceftriaxone resistant osteomyelitis patient that they recommended Augmentin for because it was sensitive on the culture, and I had no idea how to decide if I should believe them or not. And I can’t imagine how many other phenotypes of antibiotic resistance that can be recognised that I don’t know about.

The principles of how one actually constructs an empirical antibiotic guideline so I can really understand my hospital guidelines and their limitations, so that I can get more creative when first and second line options are contraindicated for some reason, and I can tell if an alternative is inferior (but acceptable given the clinical scenario) or just as good etc. For example, in a gen ward population if your local resistance to antibiotic A is less than X%, you can use it empirically, otherwise consider using antibiotic B, but if they are really sick as hell and dying please just use antibiotic B straightaway or even A+B for double coverage, and whether this is actually evidence based or not.

Problem with a PA-C at my clinic,"I’m a clinical pharmacist blessed with a great job working in an outpatient primary care clinic. My job works via patient referrals from physicians at the clinic to manage uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, uncontrolled lipids or those intolerant of statins, as well as COPD and asthma. I also see newly discharged heart failure patients for med titration/optimization. 

So far the position has been challenging but very rewarding. I’ve had great success getting uncontrolled patients to their personal goals and have been able to free up physician schedules so they can see more acute problems, which is ultimately the goal of my position. I have good relationships with everyone at the clinic, except one person...

The physician assistant initially had given me referrals when I first started, but over the last few months, these referrals have stopped completely. The PA doesn’t respond to my emails or other communication. Recently, - patient was referred to me with multiple statin intolerance. I made a recommendation in the chart and scheduled the patient into my clinic. PA then actually cancelled the appointment and implemented my recommendation. I called the nurse and I basically got some mumbling about how “the doctor prefers to manage their own patients...”. That’s just one example, there have been a few others like it lately. 

I personally feel that if my service is available, it’s a waste of time for PCPs to manage hypertension or lipids. I can follow up more frequently and it allows them to see truly acute, pertinent problems. I have no idea what caused this situation, but as it sounds, it’s extremely awkward and makes interaction with this person difficult. 

I’m looking for any advice or tips on how to communicate openly and honestly to improve this relationship. I don’t want to go on like this. Thanks in advance. ",medicine,1545266447,KidDanielB,1,1,True,2018-12-19

Asbestos and ovarian cancer,"Considering the recent news with regard to Johnson &amp; Johnson and the possible contamination of asbestos in their baby powder, I am curious about the thoughts of r/medicine on the link between asbestos and (specifically) ovarian cancer and if you have any clinical experiences with this.

Asbestos is clearly carcinogenic. Less clear to me is how asbestos fibers can reach the ovaries to cause ovarian cancer, and if there is evidence showing this happens. The following are some things I have found:

&amp;#x200B;

**Theoretical mechanisms for asbestosis reaching the ovary**

In a systematic review (linked below), the authors mention that inhaled asbestos fibers “may migrate across the diaphragm through the peritoneal cavity and penetrate the ovaries” via movement from the lungs into the interstitium followed by dissemination into the vascular and lymphatic systems.

A WHO monograph on talc (linked below) reports that “the evidence for retrograde transport of talc to the ovaries in normal women is weak. In women with impaired clearance function \[due to underlying pathology of the reproductive tract\], some evidence of retrograde transport was found.” I am assuming asbestos would present with similar findings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Evidence of asbestos and ovarian cancer**

Notably, a WHO IARC conference lecture reports that “there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of all forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite). **All forms of asbestos cause mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, larynx and ovary.**” This source is linked below, with the quote on page 8 and a meta-analysis forest plot of asbestos and ovarian cancer on page 6.

In the systematic review I mentioned earlier, the authors suggest that “the IARC decision to determine asbestos exposure as a cause of ovarian cancer was premature and not wholly supported by the evidence,” stating the small sample size in the studies could have skewed the results.

The UpToDate article on ovarian cancer risk factors was not too useful. It mentions a meta-analysis of 18 cohort studies linking asbestos exposure with significantly increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (standardized mortality ratio 1.77, 95% CI 1.37-2.28), but does not describe the pathogenesis.

Regretting job decision,"So I recently finished training and joined a large group practice in my field. The practice is innovative and the other docs are largely very happy. Problem is, I’m not. I have only been working a few months but already I feel that I am not a good fit, though as far as I can tell only I know that. Without being specific, this goes beyond the usual factors of adjusting to the new role outside of an academic environment as a trainee. I think when I accepted this position I didn’t fully understand how the job differed from others I looked at and am now deeply regretting my decision.

I know what people will say - I have barely gotten started, give it time, I could be happy down the road as I get more settled. However after much thought, I truly don’t believe I will ever be happy in this group. The issue has caused me an extreme amount of anxiety and regret. At times I have felt physically sick over this.

Now I am faced with a great problem of how to make an exit, and when. It would be a disaster both professionally and financially to up and quit now. Six or eight months, maybe I can make it. Of course even then I would still be faced with the issue of explaining my very brief tenure with any other prospective employers. Starting a solo practice is not an option for me at this point. Obviously this is my fault for not considering more thoroughly my decision to join.

However, with all the ""we are at a crossroads in anesthesia"" talk, I want to hear your take on the future of the specialty. 

Some aspects around which anesthesia seems uncertain include: Will the perioperative surgical home model take over? Is there a transition of anesthesiologists away from direct administration of anesthesia and towards more perioperative care/leadership role? Do CRNAs lead to less job security?

Refill practices,"So a couple of my partners are on leave and I'm temporarily covering their inboxes. Not a huge deal. I'm dealing with addressing a bunch of logged patient phone calls but it's just type out a phrase and have the partner's MA call the patient back - most of the requests are pretty reasonable.

Except the refills. Holy jeebus. So apparently these two partners never order more than a 4 month supply because they're paranoid the patients will no show if they have meds. Except that sometimes they're apparently not reordering the meds - or visits get rescheduled, or whatever. 

Its absolutely ridiculous! I think I've done 80 refills so far today.

Unless it's a controlled substance or a high risk medication like methimazole, I just refill all of my patients meds for a year supply every visit - just requires carrying orders over from visit to visit and I never have to deal with refill requests. Even if I was having that much trouble with no shows, I'd renew a 4 or 6 month scrip at the time of the visit. I'll admit my practice isn't nearly as full as my current partners, but even proportionally, I don't get near this volume of refill requests except when pharmacists start quibbling about test strip orders or something.

It occurred to me today that the one-time password for EPCS could be provided by the app or website performing the PDMP search.

Preoperative/perioperative imaging and testing guidelines for surgery,"Hello all. I apologize for a relatively confusing title, it was difficult for me to try and come up with one that best conveyed what I was trying to ask. I am currently a medical student, so I apologize if I am not using the medical jargon accurately, so please feel free to correct me. 

I've developed an interest in preoperative testing for surgery, and I've found numerous articles concerning guidelines and recommendations on relevant tests. It seems to have been a hot topic for debate in the ongoing discussion on how to best reduce unnecessary testing. However, I haven't found much information on recommendations for what kind of imaging may be relevant. I mention perioperative because I know there are surgical procedures that rely on real-time imaging for guidance and what not.

I was wondering if anyone had literature recommendations or sources that I could look into and further learn more about what kind of criteria are considered when determining the most relevant tests and imaging types are used. I'm aware there is a 2016 guideline from NICE concerning preoperative tests, but I haven't found anything that also took into account imaging.

In addition, I also wanted to learn more about if there were workflows on what to do when patients do not follow preoperative medication guidelines on day of surgical procedures.

"Thoughts on new healthcare related apps like Roman, Hers, Keeps, YoDerm.","As the title suggests, just wondering what /r/medicine's opinion is on these new healthcare middlemen apps. A physician is still involved in the process currently but down the road I see this changing (reading into their start up story, they ran into problems with licensing for other prescribers being different from state to state and thus went with physicians to start). Currently it's very much a form of telemedicine except the middle man is taking a cut and providing the pharmacy services.

On one hand, primary care is already at a shortage so this sort of thing can lessen the burden on an already short staffed system. On the other hand, I see this cutting into PCP office income in the future (especially if they are able to transition to a cheaper alternative prescriber once they are established). In the short term, it might increase PCP income if they take part in the service (rumors suggest docs are being paid 400 an hour for these consults).

"Nepalese man who helped saved a life on Mt Everest has a baby with Haemophilia A but cannot get treatment, any advice would be helpful.",[removed],medicine,1545663200,spacepope3,1,1,True,2018-12-24
Nepalese man who helped saved a life on Mt Everest has a baby with Haemophilia A at home. Nepal charities can't help. Anyone know any resources?,"Long story short but I was doing a trek to Everest Base Camp (as a tourist in a group of 30 people) about 2 months ago and one of the Nepalese Sherpas -""Bob"" (for confidentiality) got severe altitude sickness with cerebral and pulmonary oedema (Both HACE and HAPE). 

Bob is a 35 year old man with a very young family of his own, and is a local resident of Nepal. On the mountain he could barely walk 10 yards, I stayed back from the group and checked on him for a bit, hoping it was just some stomach bug thats slowed him down. Bob was running sats of 40%, coughing up blood, had chest pain and ataxia. I had found and given some oxygen after stopping him from going any further. After giving him some oxygen I managed to source a horse to get him to the first hospital 2 hours away. There they said he needed a helicopter down to Katmandu urgently but to our dismay the weather was too foggy and cloud covered. Luckily we still had the horse and decided that would go down the mountain fast.  The team to go down included me, Bob (drowsy on the horse) and Dan (Another Nepalese Sherpa as part of our group, who wasn't sure of the way but knew some English). We walked through the freezing night on a narrow mountain cliff edge for over 5 hours (after trekking the full day too) to get Bob down to a hospital in Khunde. Dan on multiple occasions had to help carry Bob whilst walking right on edge of the cliff because the ledge was too steep for the horse. The only thing visible from the edge was a drop into darkness, even with my torch. We were lucky that there were no casualties. Bob gets to the hospital and recovers. 

Dan is a similar age to Bob and also has a young family. Dan had taken my contact details after that ordeal. Thinking he just wants to keep in touch. He messages me recently about his 16 month old son, telling me his son has Haemophilia A and the doctors and charities in Nepal cannot do anything for him. They can only give his son factor VIII in an acute situation (bleeding) and not prophylactically. Now his son's factor VIII level is only 0.4%. As far as I can tell without prophylactic treatment his lifespan is going to be short, and probably painful. I don't really know much about this and try and find him some helpful resources and charities that might help. 

Dan tells me he has contacted:
Nepal Haemophilia society

The charities I asked him to try:
World federation of Haemophilia
Saveonelife
Directrelief

Dan says he had contacted them and they directed him to the Nepal Haemophilia society - who will only provide factor VIII in an emergency. 

Dan truly risked his life to save another and it seems no one can do anything for his son who has a treatable condition. I would appreciate any advice.

TLDR: Nepalese man who helped save another man's life on Mt Everest has a son with Haemophilia A. Nepal charities can't offer prophylactic treatment. Does anyone have any advice or know any resources?

"followup to the ""future of anesthesia"" thread. What is a CRNA's scope of practice currently and what do anesthesiologists on here think it will be like in the future.","tldr at the bottom

We hear about these places that do not require physician surveillance. Are CRNA's able to ""put out fires"" all by themselves in the opt out states? If a patient is crashing, CRNAs immediately call anesthesiology at my hospital (however whether or not this is because the hospital forces them to or if they dont feel comfortable doing it themselves is something that I dont know) so I am really surprised there are places where CRNA's 1) agree to have that responsibility and 2) how the hospital allows them to do so (even if it is a 1/10000 occurrence, thats a huge liability) putting someone under for a simple appy or hernia is not likely to have them crash and I can feasibly see them being allowed to manage those cases without help. Because if the patient does start having trouble, it might not be a full blown ""fire"". Can someone comment on this?

Furthermore, are there any operations that CRNAs would NOT be allowed to manage? In the future will CRNAs be able to do the complicated heart, CNS, peds, trauma etc. cases? I talked to a CRNA at my hospital and they said that it is already starting to happen, which he seemed like one of those more aggressive CRNAs regarding CRNA scope of practice. I wanted to ask anesthesiologists here what they think to confirm or deny. Then there was another comment on twitter by the AANA guy that said that anesthesiologists are just doing a nurse's job which got me just wondering what it is that would seperate a CRNA from an anesthesiolgist. At my hospital, CRNAs do spinals, epidurals, central lines, etc. So I dont exactly know what a CRNA CANNOT do.

For reference, I am interested in peds anesthesia. so the 4 years of anesthesia and then the 1 or so year of peds stuff. I can definitely see how a general anesthesiologist can do peds cases, but the thought of CRNAs being able to do them irritates me because it makes me think ""should have gone to CRNA school instead of this"" lol

Lastly, are there anesthesiologists on here that I can PM more questions to bounce ideas off of them from now until like match or something"". I feel like I want to make sure I am making the right decision for me in entering the field and would really appreciate if people would let me PM them my questions (no matter how stupid it is :P)

tldr: 1) what differentiates a crna from a general anesthesiologist in terms of scope of practice. 2) do you ever see CRNAs being able to manage complicated peds, heart, open surgeries as they continue to lobby in the next 10 or 20 years? ",medicine,1545689992,CrownedDesertMedic,3,1,True,2018-12-24

Understanding the world/spirituality as a med student and the idea of brainwashed,"Hi,  
I'm sorry if i sound wierd or smt, but i really need to ask some questions and i have no idea who could i ask to get those answers.  
well... First of all, I'm a 4th year med student. I have spent the last days studying for the exams, in january but, in the meantime, some questions grow on me.  
Well, i grow up hearing some different concepts about the world, humans,... around interesting ideas of spirituality. I've read many books before entering medicine about reincarnation, about humans having ""7 bodies"",... many different things (incluiding doing reiki, shiatsu, and other things). Some of them, grow on me, and i believe deeply in them. I am aware, easily, of how much of ilusion this world is. But i don't won't to enter this discussion.  
The thing is, outside of this small bubble of belives i made, from things i believe because i think i can experience it, it's becoming hard to talk about them about these things.  
Since i've entered medicine, and entering the clinical years, i feel kind of brainwashed (i dont mean this in a positive or negative way, since i can't interpretate it), in the meaning that my mind sets up a padron when i think about diseases, causes/mechanisms -&gt; symptoms -&gt; treatment, or even about the world, that is shared about my teachers and collegues, leaving no space for anything else.  
You see, for instance, my family talks about ""natural treatments are better than medicine"" and i keep asking ""what is natural?""; ""you know what H2O is? It's a chemistry... for water"", and more and more.  
I don't know if i say those things because i want them to think like me or because i'm afraid that i used to think like them and don't want to face it... or... i dunno.  
I see some small discussions with them. they have some nice arguments, for instance, i have an wierd allergy (wich source i can't find), went to 2 dermatologists (one was my teacher in med school) and  Corticosteroid help very little. A member of my family suggested banana peel, i was very reluctant and guess what? it's sooooooo effective. This makes discussions about ""natural treatments"" very conflicting in my mind for me, when i talk about it...   
Sometimes i don't know where to draw the line or even if this line exists. I feel lost thinking about my believes... I've used to meditate to clean up my mind (and that is very good for it), but now i mostly play some games to distract my mind (being dragonborn is also cool).

RN seeking advice on how to best communicate with residents,"wall of text incoming

Right of the bat I will acknowledge that there is not one true answer here.  Communication is a personal thing, and I know there will be a lot of variation between personalities.  Some will want just the facts and would become annoyed by suggestions while others expect me to provide suggestions without them having to ask.  I'm just looking for some general feedback.  

My background is in the military as a NCO.  Working as an intelligence analyst, I frequently worked with LTs, which had a similar experience/education dynamic as a RN working with a resident where the LT/resident has much more education than me, but I generally have more experience than them, especially with our patient population.  I'd found that leaving breadcrumbs or hints and letting the LT come up with the idea themselves led to less resistance to my suggestions.  Over time, I was able to identify how to motivate the officers by telling them that more senior officers would be upset by inaction in a given scenario (when applicable).  Really the idea is to avoid a personality driven conflict or adversarial dynamic and get the authorization for what I know needs to happen.  I also keep in mind that there are a lot of angles I'm probably not seeing due to my limited education.

Here is a rundown of the scenario that prompted me to think a little harder about my communication with residents.

Patient is a middle-aged male with colon CA s/p colectomy POD 2.  PMH of COPD and portal vein thrombosis (on warfarin, bridging with Lovenox).  Patient claims he has had a few BMs but has suspiciously flushed it before staff can see it.  Patient claimed he was passing flatus on evening shift (I'm on overnight).  I get to this patient later than I'd like due to another patient's condition, but he seems to have been stable, so I'm not too worried about.

I get into the room and the patient's abdomen is distended and firm.  Patient now denies passing flatus or any bowel movements.  Patient is experiencing abdominal cramping that he points out is very different than his incisional pain.  Patient is nauseous.  Zofran, Compazine, and Reglan have had no effect.  I page the intern asking about imaging and maybe an NG tube.  Intern to bedside, agrees that he is very distended.  They tap on the abdomen and say it is full of air.  No NG tube at this time unless there is emesis (none to this point).  We restart maintenance fluids and a 500 mL bolus since he isn't tolerating oral fluids, give some simethicone, and ascertain that I will call if there is emesis.

An hour or so later after spending quite a bit of time with the patient that has been concerning me more, I return with simethicone and try to get the patient to get up for a walk.  He says he feels like he isn't getting enough air.  I put his oximeter on and he is satting at 49% on room air.  We call a rapid and eventually get his back into the 90s after a while on BiPAP 100%.  Patient is also tachy in the 130s, BP is kinda soft 110/60 (same as it was for most of the day) despite the heart rate.  I ask the intern if he could have perf'd something in his GI, she doesn't think so.  I'm worried about a bleed, given that the patient got 100 of Lovenox on the day of surgery and has continued receiving it.  Primary concern is a PE, but chest CT is negative for that, radiology suspects an ileus when looking at the abdominal CT.  Chest CT showed some crud in the lungs, but nothing that looks like aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or anything that should be tanking his respiratory this bad.  

While down in CT some of the labs from the rapid start coming in: critical value lactate 5.1, ABGs show CO2 retention (I can't recall the numbers), pH on low end of 7.2, hemoglobin has dropped from 13 something on day of surgery to 10 something to day after to 8 something now.  WBC has climbed from 5 something to 16 something.  Trop negative, 12 lead was sinus tach.  We get back from CT with no further changes.  

Chief of the admitting service arrives and we put an NG in.  It's red tinged.  While we do get about 800 mL out of the NG tube, it's clearly not draining all of the stomach contents and there is no observable change to the patient's abdomen.  Chief had also ordered a 2L LR bolus as the patient's pressures had continued to fall (90s/50s) and the tachycardia had sped up to 140s.  Sats are all over the board as we insert the NG tube, as we had to switch to a nonrebreather mask, since we can't put an NG tube in with the BiPAP on.  BiPAP goes back on after the NG is in and thankfully still seals despite the tube and the patient's beard.  I ask the chief about the lactate and whether he thinks the patient is septic and bleeding, explaining my schooling only ever brought up lactate in the setting of sepsis.  Chief is concerned about the bleeding but thinks that ventilation will improve if we are able to empty out the GI tract.  I ask about IV abx to go along with the 2L bolus, but he says not right now (I had access to do both).

Attending comes around for rounds and wants the patient on tele, still sinus tach.  Within a couple of minutes, he decides that this patient is headed for the SICU, five hours after the rapid response was called.  On arrival there, blood cultures are obtained, sepsis protocol IV abx are started, and pressures have fallen to 80s/40s.  He gets another 1L LR bolus and was probably going to get started on some pressors.  Patient only made 225 mL of urine for me (no retention) after my 2500 in boluses plus maint fluids.  Patient eventually gets 2 units PRBC and 1 of FFP after hemoglobin continues to fall into the 7s.

I can't help but feel that the sepsis workup should have been pursued once that lactate came back, or some blood ordered once the hemoglobin and NG output were observed.  While I didn't put it together as soon as I'd have liked, as I was running my ass off, was tired going into the shift, and probably dehydrated, I was the first to bring up sepsis, GI bleed, and what they wanted me to do about it.  My approach with the chief was much more deferential than with the intern, given that he has more experience than me in general and especially with this patient population.  Should I have stood firmer?  I know he needed a higher level of care and made sure to let my opinion on that be known.  Rather than demand the NG tube, sepsis workup, and blood, I just laid the facts out for the docs I was working with.  I'm sure they were thinking the same things I was.  I have noticed that many of the newer residents are very hesitant to make ""big"" decisions on patients, especially at night.  This patient's trajectory had changed from possibly going home the next day to an ICU transfer.  Are residents discouraged from making big decisions overnight?  Are they scared?  How can I help them make that jump from concern to intervention?  What could I have done differently here?  I had my charge nurse, who is more experienced, with me for most of the night, and she didn't really get more assertive with the docs than I did.  I'll probably crosspost this to r/nursing, but I really wanted to post it here to get a medicine perspective on it.",medicine,1545871575,golson3,83,1,True,2018-12-26

Doctor Dress Code?,"I’m pre dent and hopefully will become an oral surgeon.

Resident teaching at night,"Hey guys!

I’m a nocturnist working at a university affiliated community teaching hospital. I love my job - I get to admit many high acuity patients, run codes, but what I love most about it is the opportunity to teach residents. I try to discuss interesting points about each patient that comes in and with debriefing sessions after codes - but I feel like I’m very inconsistent about it due to a lack of structure.

I’m posting because I’d like to hear any ideas that would help establish structure to teaching at night from a medical student/resident perspective. I’m not a big fan of long, structured didactic sessions because they get boring and I’m sure that’s not what residents want during a stretch of night shifts (I wouldn’t). I’d like to have residents walk away having learned a few things after each rotation, but without the burden of having to sit through bloated sessions.

First time posting on Reddit. It seems like this is a great community and I wish i had started participating sooner.

Thanks!",medicine,1545987555,Teeth90,42,1,True,2018-12-28
Why do we have 'negotiated prices' with insurance companies?,"Wouldn't it make a lot more sense for an insurance company to set a national price for something and then allow doctors in regions to accept that or to charge the patient money above it?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, Insurance A pays $1,000 for a knee replacement. Doctor A performs this for $1,000  (because he/she lives in a cheap cost of living area, is fresh out of school, etc), while Doctor B performs this for $1,500. In this latter case, the patient would swipe his or her credit card and pay $500 upfront and the rest would be managed by the insurance company.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like this would solve a lot of problems: decrease overhead because no longer a need for negotiators, allow doctors to charge what they want based on market forces, and also - most importantly - allow for price transparency.

"Thank you to the medical doctors who teach at colleges, especially community colleges!","Whole reason i subbed here was because ive always been fascinated by doctors dedication to education. Yeah, you make good money but its not a who you know thing like engineering, accounting or finance can be. Yall put in a decade of hard work..my grandfather whos still alive and 77 was a derm. He sold his practice in 1990s after he got his masters in electrical engineering and a job a argon and then fermilab. What was most fascinating to me is when my dad knocked up my mom he went and taught at the local com college so my 19 yr old dad could get a free education, which he did. A medical doctor who later got his master in EE TAUGHT AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR HIS SONS BENEFIT AND STAYED ON DOING IT. 2013 my wife a bartender with 100 hours of college and no motivation for a major takes anatomy 2, taught by a passionate retired obgyn, this doctor took a liking to my wife and guided her to becoming a dental hygienist. 2015 my sister takes same course, same doctor, shes 2nd year med now.

Medications and durations for Pyelonephritis.,"I’m a primary care PA who’s been working for 2 years. Being a PA comes with a short education and quick learning curve, so I rely pretty heavily on guidelines and medical literature as I gain experience. Based on UTD, Epocrates, and sanford, treatment for pyelo seems to be 7 days of a fluoroquinolone or 14 days of Bactrim DS or beta-lactam therapy. However, in clinical practice I see other providers and patients who have been d/c from the ED on either 7 days of bactrim DS or 7 days of keflex BID.

Transition From Paramedic To M.D.???,"Has anyone here been a paramedic and later decided to become a doctor? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in emergency medical services for a while now and am realizing that although I love the medical field, being a paramedic is not enough to satisfy my hunger for knowledge. I seek further knowledge in medicine and I am exploring different medical careers. I have looked at RN, NP, PA, CRNA, and others. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, I am also considering becoming a doctor. I am doing research on what would be a good way to transition from my position as a Paramedic to eventually becoming a doctor. I know that if I wanted to be an RN, for example, there are programs for paramedics where they could put me through a 1-year program and I would have my RN licence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure that there is no such thing as a Paramedic to M.D. program, as that is just unrealistic and ridiculous. I am just wondering if you all know what a good path would be for me to get there, from where I am now. I can't seem to figure out if it would be best to take a Post-Bachelor Medprep program, or if I should go for my RN and then go from there, or should I go for PA and then from PA to MD, or what. There are so many options and paths I cannot figure out which is best.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if there is anyone who has gone through this path, I would LOVE to know what you did, and what you would recommend someone in a similar situation. Even if you haven't gone down this path, I want to know what your thoughts are, and what advice/information you have for me. I am not afraid of going back to school, and am open to all suggestions.

Would like some advice on management acute psychosis at the emergency department,"Hello physician of reddit. I'm a PGY-1 GP in a rural hospital in east Asia. I would like some advice regarding a situation I faced recently. I have read the rules but I am not sure if this post is appropriate so if it is not then I apologize. Please feel free to delete this post if it is so.

&amp;#x200B;

So the situation was, I was on night shift. It was around 21:00. There was a 44 years old male presenting with chief complaint of auditory hallucination of someone trying to kill him for 2 days. He looked fatigued and was oriented to time, place, person and was coherent. No past history of illness in the EMR, and the patient denied any underlying disease or medication. He had history of drinking alcohol 5-6 glasses a day everyday for 5 months, and denied any other substance use. He denied suicidal thought, depression or other mood disorder. Physical exam reveled no focal neurological deficit. I ran the basic lab, CBC, Electrolyte including calcium, phosphate and magnesium, Liver function. I also ordered a CT Scan with contrast media of the brain (There was no MRI by the way at my hospital). All tests came out negative and the CT scan revealed no gross hemorrhage, mass or structural lesion. Then I noticed that his white blood cell was 13,000, not a lot but not that normal either in my opinion. The patient denied history of fever but I deemed history unreliable due to copious amount of alcohol drinking. The relatives who came with him add that there were moments where he completely ""zoned out"" and did not speak a word but his gaze was still responsive to sound.

&amp;#x200B;

After my evaluation, due to the acute onset of 1st psychosis episode, with no family history and no obvious substance use, coupled with a little leukocytosis and what might be episodes of seizure or alteration of consciousness, I concluded that there were character characteristics possibly indicative of organic origin of psychosis. It was my understanding that any organic cause of psychosis must be excluded first before diagnosing functional psychosis. I gave him 2.5 mg intramuscular halopedirol. I then admitted the patient to the medical ward with plans to observe fever or sign of alteration of consciousness and to further consider lumbar puncture, and if all turn out negative then consider psychiatric consult. The intern at the medical floor proceeded to call me 1 hour later and berate me for admitting a psychiatric patient to a medical ward with no psychiatric consult first. He then refused to see the patient and told me that, since I just admitted a psychiatric patient to internal medicine, I was to be the one who see him. The next morning, I went to the internal medicine floor (Not my floor. I went in to see this patient especially) to discovered that the patient was lucid, void of fever and was hearing no auditory hallucination. I consulted the psychiatrist on call and was told over the phone to discharge the patient and told the patient to came to the psychiatric OPD with no medication as he wished to evaluate him first due to it being his first episode of psychosis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Appropriate holiday gift/thank you for physicians?,"I am not a doctor, and if this is not an appropriate question to ask here, I apologize. I will delete.

I am just a layperson who has struggled with autoimmune issues and infertility for years. It's been a really hard couple of years for me, but I have had an amazing team of doctors and for the first time in years I have hope, thanks to them. My autoimmune disease is under better control than it has been for many years and I am 14.5 weeks pregnant! All of this is thanks to my amazing doctors.

I don't have a lot of spare money around the holidays, but I wanted to find a nice way to say thank you to my doctors for all they have done for me over the past couple of years. I've had doctors call me late at night with test results and updates when I had a bad day. I've had doctors sit with me and cry when I received bad news. I even had one of my specialists drive in the middle of the work day/week to meet me at the hospital when I had an emergency in the ER. My doctors have gone above and beyond for me, and with the holidays coming up, I thought it would be a good time to find a way to express thanks.

So, I'm not asking for medical advice, but I'm wondering if any of you wonderful medical professionals could recommend a way that I could genuinely say thank you to my team of doctors. I thought of sending a fruit basket or some sort of holiday edible arrangement, but it just doesn't seem to quite say thank you as much I would like. Like I said, I don't have a ton of money, but I wanted to do something different, rather than just paying my medical bills (which I do pay).

Any suggestions or ideas are very much appreciated. And for all you do as medical professionals, thank you for all you do. Your time and expertise is appreciated.

Filling Rx's under the wrong/different prescriber,"I'm just a pharmacist but I'm wondering what prescribers themselves think of this. 

I don't think a day or hour goes by that a pt doesn't drop off an Rx and I can't tell who wrote it. If I'm lucky, I have a list of prescribers on the Rx to choose from and a somewhat legible signature. Obviously if it's a control I make damned sure it's perfect, but let's say it's a diflucan 150 on a friday night after the clinic has closed and Jackie Smith MD and Joey Smith MD at the same practice have very similar signatures.

I'm not the sort of pharmacist that harasses offices for things like converting Amox 250/5 to a 400/5 of the same dose (I've seen pharmacists refuse to fill w/o dr's permission to change concentration which blows my mind... me, i just do the math since our exam tested us on those exact types of Q's). 

But when we are entering Rx's, prescriber is one of many fields needed for a legal Rx and sometimes it's just not clear at all and we are caught between delaying an Rx, wasting Dr's office time vs perfectionism and the off-chance that harm could come (i.e., allergy, ade, etc.) while just guessing which prescriber's license to put on the Rx label.",medicine,1542093689,hal0hal0,16,1,True,2018-11-13

Please tell about your Daily Life on ward,"Hello Guys and Girls,

I'm a resident of inner medicine from Germany who is just starting out. At my Hospital we're planning to restructure The Daily Business of The Ward, as our Director has The opinion - which I Share - that The normal daily Routine of wards in Germany is very ineffeicient. I'm interested to Hear How it is in your country to be inspired.

This is how it works in my hospital:
The day starts at 8 with a short meeting to hear what happened in the night. Afterwards it's blood drawing. If you're lucky you have a student and you don't have to do it yourself. Then it's time for the dismissals. Correcting some things about the dismissal papers, waiting for the blood results, organizing appointments for readmissal etc. Normally you're done with this by 10. Afterwards it's time for ward rounds. This take anywhere from 1 hour to two hours normally (more on the latter side for me). After this we normally go for lunch and the nurses will work out what we ordered during our rounds. At 2 pm there is a radiologic presentation of all the imaging we ordered during the last 24 hours and afterwards the admission for the day are presented by doctor who is working in the emergency room.
The rest of the day is all kinds of small stuff and preparing the dissmissal papers for the next day - which we dictate.

So this a day of a resident in internal medicine in Germany. 🇩🇪 
Im really interested to hear about your days! Also from nurses, other people working in the hospital.

I hadn't sent her some things yet, when today I got an email straight from the facility inviting me to interview. Said recruiter wasn't familiar with this, but the emails directly from facility ""x"" have been moving forward with scheduling things.

We need to change obesity screening measurements,"Today I saw a 29 year old male with no significant past medical history for an annual physical. He weighted roughly 250lbs and was 5’11”. The computer pinged his chart that he was ‘obese’ and that I should discuss obesity risk factors and provide a plan for weight loss. This guy was fit! He was someone who worked out a bit, and I decided to stick it to the chart and provide the waist to hip ratio for good measure. It was 0.79 (less than 0.83 indicates low risk in his age category). I think this guy is being labeled by a computer at all points of care as obese bc his BMI is 35 (roughly), yet he’s probably healthier than a man with a BMI of 25 who eats like shit and is sedentary but was blessed with a fast metabolism. So, given the new shitty ‘quality’ metrics, we need to change this or were gonna start offending some fit people under the guise of perceived quality.

I once used the word ""armamentarium"" in casual, non-medical conversation and she asked me what that meant--that had never happened before nor since. I explained it to her, and how it's often used with antibiotic choices, and she said it must be common usage only in medicine. Huh, okay.

Next, during her last delivery, she remarked on how often the physicians/nurses said to her, ""This isn't your first rodeo."" I say this all the time but according to her no one else does, and it was odd how often she heard it in the hospital.

Personal Cellphones &amp; Patient Confidentiality,"I had an interesting discussion with a group of residents regarding use of personal cellphones and patient confidentiality that I wanted to extend to this subreddit.

I think that strictly speaking (say from a regulatory body perspective) the use of personal cellphones to discuss patient information is looked down upon as a potential breach of confidential information. But the reality is that that most residents and physicians do this on a regular basis. It makes work and communication efficient. There's some ways to make information less identifiable such as by using patient initials or room # instead of the name, but I've seen people communicate using full patient names, send photos, etc. We probably shouldn't, but we do.

I feel like this is something that will be heavily scrutinized (if not already in some places)... the policy surrounding confidentiality hasn't caught up with the use of technology. Even if policies exist, they aren't strongly enforced as of yet.

What are people's thoughts/opinions about this practice?

Does it matter if say you are using text messaging or encrypted services such as WhatsApp or Telegram?

What about photos of patients or X-rays/CT-scans; add to the fact that most photos nowadays are synced with cloud storage?

\[Note: I spent quite some time looking for the right place to post this. If I'm off base, please let me know! Far be it from me to step on anyone's toes...\]

&amp;#x200B;

As an Eagle scout, I like to think that my first aid skills are fairly decent. As in, for most common situations, I believe I can do a serviceable job at keeping things under control until professional help \[i.e. someone from this subreddit\] is available. Which, when you're backpacking, can take a few hours.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, where I'm at, I feel like someone who learned a bunch of phrases like ""where is the bathroom?"" in a foreign language. It's critical knowledge, yes, but, I feel that it could/should be expanded.

&amp;#x200B;

I still volunteer with the Scouts, but I'm aged out by a while now. That said, what can I do to continue being prepared for first aid situations? Books? Courses? A scout is thrifty, but I am attending a university\*, and do have access to a library if it helps.

Your Stance on the “Doctor’s Note”,"As a newer primary care provider and it being cold season I am getting an influx of folks with colds and respiratory complaints (of course usually viral) who at the end of their appointments sneak in the request for a “doctors note,” some to go as far as to ask for an extra day off work to recover. Some folks I’ve found have a pattern of doing this towards the end of the week (ex Thurs and asking for Friday off as well).

As I examine my response to these requests I’ve found at first I was like “Sure, no problem, no foul to me.” But as times gone on my thinking has shifted to the stance of “Ill give a note stating you were at your appointment, but if you want days off you’ll have to utilize your sick leave.” Now as said this is mainly for bread and butter URI stuff, for confirmed flu or pneumonia or something where public health is a concern it’s a different story.

Diseases do not play dice with patients' bodies,"Lamenting the irreducible statistical nature of quantum mechanics, Einstein proclaimed, ""God does not play dice with the universe."" In a similar vein,  I find myself feeling very uneasy about hoping the patient is one of the 70% of people who respond to therapy positively. 

&amp;#x200B;

Physics, chemistry, anatomy and physiology are very precise sciences. So it would seem that since medicine is just application of those sciences toward a goal, it would be precise too. But it isn't. However, that isn't because disease somehow violates the basic sciences. Diseases don't play dice. The problem is an epistemic one: we cannot \*know\* everything about what's going on, so we have to make an educated guess. It's in this guessing that we rely on statistics. The disease processes themselves are as precise and predictable as the Krebs cycle. We just can't see them well enough to treat them as such. Instead, we must rely on broad trends based on incomplete information.

&amp;#x200B;

As diagnostic tests become more fine-grained (e.g. PET scans) and therapies become more specific (e.g. nanotechnologies, stem cells), we'll have less guessing to do. But I suspect the nature of medicine is such that we will never be able to do away completely with probabilistic care. As Osler put it, ""Medicine is a science of uncertainty, and an act of probability."" Nevertheless, we should still do our best to make the individual patient the center of our focus. We're sometimes too quick to defer to statistics before understanding our patient's as individuals.",medicine,1542307667,ServentOfReason,0,1,True,2018-11-15

However, that isn't because disease somehow violates the basic sciences. Diseases don't play dice. The problem is an epistemic one: we cannot \*know\* everything about what's going on, so we have to make an educated guess. It's in this guessing that we rely on statistics. The disease processes themselves are as precise and predictable as the Krebs cycle. We just can't see them well enough to treat them as such. Instead, we must rely on broad trends based on incomplete information.

As diagnostic tests become more fine-grained (e.g. PET scans) and therapies become more specific (e.g. nanotechnologies, stem cells), we'll have less guessing to do. But I suspect the nature of medicine is such that we will never be able to do away completely with probabilistic care. As Osler put it, ""Medicine is a science of uncertainty, and an act of probability."" Nevertheless, we should still do our best to make the individual patient the center of our focus. We're sometimes too quick to defer to statistics before understanding our patients as individuals.",medicine,1542308275,ServentOfReason,18,1,True,2018-11-15

Has anyone ever reported a fellow physician to their regulatory board before? Considering a case.,"I’m in a situation where I’m strongly considering reporting another physician to the local regulatory board and I was curious about whether anyone else has went through a similar issue in the past. 

I work as a primarily locum GP in various communities in Canada. Twice now I’ve seen patients after they saw this other local physician. 

This other physician is trained as a family medicine doctor, but apparently operates under the guise of a “holistic practice.” I do not believe he takes patients chronically, but he does individual consultations for them with an initial consult fee of $300. In Canada all visit fees are paid for through the provincial governments, and so he really should not be charging patients directly for visits, unless they are for things that are not covered (travel medicals, drivers medicals, etc). I suspect he may be double dipping. 

The first was a gentleman with fairly garden variety generalized anxiety who I was working up and treating was treating as appropriate. He’s had mild headaches which I am confident were tension h/a's with no red flags. I saw him later after he went to that other physician to get a holistic opinion and had a slew of inappropriate labwork ordered (test levels, dheas, progesterone?, cortisol?) as well as was convinced to pay for an MRI brain privately. In Canada all our visits are covered under the provincial health plans, as are MR’s, but a pt can pay privately for an MR (usually upwards of a grand). This was an unnecessary MRI, and costly. 

That alone was bad, but the second patient was far worse. 

The second patient is a gentleman who saw him two years ago for nonspecific fatigue for years. The physician ordered the same slew of inappropriate hormone testing and labwork (he’s ordering these under the system cost, despite not being indicated). I can see the results from two years ago and they were grossly normal, with a very slightly low cortisol level that was just barely below the cutoff of low. In that two years he has started them on a large dose of cortef, dessicated thyroid (for normal TSH and T4 levels), DHEA supplements, testosterone at supratherapeutic doses, progesterone (yes, dont know why) and a few other medications I can’t recall now. This has been ongoing for two years. Monitoring of his test levels has been sporadic – maybe once/year if that, and despite supratherapeutic levels on the rare occasions it was checked was never decreased. His hg was not monitored, his thyroid was not monitored, and more. 

This pt saw me on a walk in basis covering for a gp who had just taken him on as a patient and had ordered some labwork to investigate his fatigue (at this point his new gp was not aware he was on all these meds). I recalled him after I saw his suppressed tsh and Hg of 190 (Canadian units, equivalent to 19.in us?). He had been having hair loss, fatigue, had signs of chronic steroid exposure, and more. It took me a while to realize he was on this slew of hormones, and longer to figure out why. I had a frank discussion with the pt that I suspected these were inappropriate and at the least they were clearly supratherapeutic and poorly monitored. I started him on a taper of all of them after long discussion about the risk of MI, stroke etc if he continued. At this point it came to light that the pt had seen an actual endocrinologist a year ago from his last gp who had agreed that all the hormones were unneeded and was pure medical quackery, yet the pt had continued seeing this holistic gp despite that consult. 

I sent another endo consult to help him taper off, reiterated the risks, but finished my locum and have not followed him further. I have incidentally discussed this case in passing with a few cardiology and endo colleagues, and they told me that they had heard of this physician, and apparently there was at least one case of someone having a heart attack after inappropriate testosterone. I'm not sure if anyone ever filed a complaint 

In my head this feels like medical malpractice to me. Unnecessary hormones, at higher than typical doses, unmonitored, with no clear indication. And a physician charging patients directly and excessively in a system where they should be charging the system screams of secondary gain to me. 

Meddit, I’d appreciate your thoughts and advice on this case. Has anyone reported a colleague before, and was anything done? Would you agree with me I should do so? How did you go about it, what did you say in the letter to the college? ",medicine,1542318107,PublicHealthBurner,1,1,True,2018-11-15

Pediatrics Case,"Hi y'all,

I love Meddit cases, so I thought I would share one that I saw very recently. I'll admit from the very start--we don't have a final diagnosis yet, so I'm also hoping to crowd-source the smart minds here to help figure out what the hell is going on. 

**CASE**

You're in your outpatient pediatrics clinic when you get a call from the parent of one of your patients. She is an 11yoF, and today the school nurse called her parents to tell them that she was pretty tired and dizzy, and her pupils were dilated. The parents want to bring her in to clinic to have her evaluated, so you book her a slot 15 mins from now. 

She arrives to clinic and you observe a profoundly ataxic female who is requiring adult support bilaterally just to walk down the hallway. She looks very ill. She has almost no truncal stability. You get her on an exam bed and try and talk with her, and note that her mental status is altered. She can't tell you where she is or what day it is, she just keeps saying ""I'm so tired"" and ""I'm cold"". 

You call a squad to get her to the ED, and while you wait do an exam. She has a profoundly disconjugate gaze primarily in her right eye, pupils alternate between dilated and miotic. She is not tracking at all, her eyes keep looking all over the place. No nystagmus noted. She does endorse some mild photophobia but doesn't seem to recoil from your penlight at all. Her conjunctiva are maybe a bit injected. No jolt accentuation or nuchal rigidity. No lymphadenopathy. Heart and lungs sound fine. Abdomen mildly tender per the pt, but not showing objective signs of tenderness. Extremities show good cap refill, no cyanosis or deformity. 

Per the pt's mom, she had felt a little tired this AM before leaving for school, but she was otherwise totally normal. No medical history, mom denies any access to meds or drugs or chemicals. 

You get a BGL in clinic and it's 96. BP is 90/60, pulse 113, she is afebrile. 

Your attending calls the ED and tells them about the pt, and that she will need a head CT and likely an LP. He tells them he's worried about a rapidly progressive viral myelitis/encephalitis, and to have a low threshold to intubate this girl (your attending also did a peds Crit Care fellowship, so he doesn't tend to get worked up by much). Because it's a small town and you're just a med student, you ride along with the squad to the ED so that you can do her LP when she gets there and assist in her workup. 

In the bus she continues to have gaze abnormalities, but her mentation gets better. She seems to have a fluctuating level of alertness. 

In the ED, she continues to have a disconjugate gaze. She has good strength in all extremities, no pronator drift, but she does move her arms in a wave-like fashion when she closes her eyes. Heel-to-shin is normal, finger-to-nose normal. Pupils responsive at this point. 

Pt goes to the CT scanner, which is normal, and comes back. When she gets back one of the nurses says ""I think we have a case of 'being bullied.'"" You ask what she means, and she says that the patient is completely normal at this point. She's conversing normally, talking about two boys in school who were picking on her, and laughing with her mom. 

On repeat exam, she now knows where she is, but doesn't recall going to clinic at all. Her gaze is markedly better, with only mild delay in the right eye. She is able to ambulate across the room with only mild instability, balance on one foot bilaterally, and her Romburg is normal. Truncal stability WNL. She denies ingesting any foreign substances today, denies eating or drinking anything that was given to her by another kid as well.

Am open letter to our nurse (and amazing health professionals everywhere)...,"You weren't even the nurse assigned to us, but when we paged you in the early hours of the morning to ask you questions about feeding our newborn, you were the one covering our nurse's break, so in you came.

We asked you some questions about breastfeeding. My wife was concerned about getting a proper latch, how often the baby should be eating, is it supposed to hurt, and was there anything we could do about baby's fingernails, since we hadn't brought a file or clippers with us.

You were calm, reassuring, and kind. You looked to see how the baby was feeding, and you assured my wife that she was latched right. You pointed out how baby's lips were flanged out, how she had a good mouthful, and how she was taking deep and slow sucks. You reassured us that we were doing it right, and told us how to know if a latch was bad.

You came in again before your shift was over to make sure the rest of the feedings had gone well, and to let us know that you had gone ahead and called a lactation consultant to come and look things over in case we had any more questions.

What you didn't know was that we hadn't had as good fortune with baby one. She never latched right, wasn't getting enough to eat, was already underweight, and so we had to switch to formula. Through the whole ordeal, anyone we asked for help would watch her latch, say ""it looks good, and you'll know if it's a bad latch"", and then leave. It was so frustrating to not know what was wrong, and that no one would explain the situation well enough to help us. I know you guys are so very busy, but we felt so confused and over our heads.

But not you. You helped. You explained WHY it was right. You told us how to know if it was wrong. You have us to on different holds to try, how to trick baby into eating from her not-favorite breast, and you told us that pain is normal, but shouldn't be constant, and that we could expect some pain for the first couple weeks.

All of these things helped us feel WAY more informed and confident. Things weren't vague or nebulous anymore. You took the book knowledge and explained it in a practical and simple way. 

Thank you. From the bottom of our hearts (and our baby's belly), thank you. You took something that felt overwhelming and helped us find the confidence to tackle it, so far with great success. You fine folks in the medical community work ceaseless hours with hardly a word of thanks, and there's precious little I can do to change that. But thank you, each and every one of you, for the immense difference you make in the lives of others. You really are angels among humanity.

The reality of medical malpractice plaintiff attorneys,"I don't do medical malpractice, nor do the vast majority of attorneys. Since a common misconception exists among medical folks regarding this fact, I'll explain it with math and statistics.

&amp;#x200B;

Malpractice paid claims in the US per year total[ around 4 billion.](https://www.diederichhealthcare.com/the-standard/2016-medical-malpractice-payout-analysis/) Let's assume the average attorney fee is 40%, which is on the high side. 40% of 4 billion is 1.6 billion and that divided by the 1.2 million attorneys in the US, comes to 1.3k per attorney. And keep in mind that's gross income so the net is much lower. Hopefully that explains why less than 1% of attorneys sue physicians from a financial standpoint.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not suggesting attorneys are all saints and trust me, I despise some of my colleagues more than you can imagine. But I think the animosity some of you folks have against the profession is misguided and ironically detrimental to both of our professions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I'm a huge advocate for medical professionals. A physician absolutely changed my life and I'm engaged to one. That's why I started posting here if anyone was wondering wtf an attorney contributes to a medical sub.

TIFU: accidentally offended a patient during a cervical check,"Hi! I would like to share a quick story today. Some of y’all might cringe and others may find this funny. Anyways I’m currently an OBGYN resident. We had this patient come in today for an induction and her BMI is around 55. Anyways during her first exam, it was difficult but manageable and she was found to be a modest 0/0/-4. Awesome. Anyways during a cervical check later, the lights were off cause it was late. I initially had trouble finding her cervix again in the dark because her thighs (massive btw) covered up her vagina and she also had a TON of redundant tissue. I didn’t want to go diving in her thigh forever so I asked the nurse to turn on the lights. Boom! 1/25/-3. Progress!

Later i find out she didn’t want me to check her anymore as she was offended I had to turn the lights on. On 1 hand I thought turning the lights on was the least awkward thing because it legit would have taken a good bit of time to feel all the way up to the opening as you had to navigate through so much tissue. On the other hand I indirectly called her fat. 

My co-residents and attending couldn’t stop laughing and told me it happens to the best of us. I guess now I’m part of a funny story that will get passed down: the boy who turned on the lights to find the vagina. Learning point was that what should I have done? The easy answer is “get better” and yeah i agree.

"Seriously, why can't physician's unionize?

Along with the 'dire-straits' articles or posts here on Reddit is usually someone (myself included) suggesting that physicians should form a union- much like nurses- to have more power in healthcare policy. 

This is typically followed by discussion about how physicians cannot unionize. From what I understand, most doctors can't be in a union because they act as independent contractors (ie, they are both the employee and the boss). 

Is there anything specific stopping a union/collective bargaining group being set up that consists of physicians accepting medicare/medicaid? I think of this, because it would include a great proportion of doctors in the US, and in theory puts the physicians in the employee role and the government (medicare/medicaid) in the employer role.

What is the most common reaction to resident suicide among attendings?,"I recently read about the Duke anesthesia program's response to a resident suicide which was to 1) blame the resident and 2) keep the attendings from participating in any resident activities. I have also read Mt. Sinai's response which was to both ignore the problem and, you guessed it, blame the dead doctor. 

I know attendings know the root cause of most resident suicides. I know programs have the choice to ease resident workloads - my friend is at an institution where one department hires a moonlighter once a week so the residents can have a whole day off. I know there is still the tendency to talk about the good old days of 120 hour work weeks and how we're all soft. 

So when one of your residents jumps off a building, how do you react?

Sadness? Desire to address underlying problems? Blame the resident? Be annoyed the resident just caused you some headache? Pile onto the other remaining residents and simultaneously blame them while making sure 8 people do the work of 9? Sit at home and wonder what you missed? Sit and home and wonder if you should have chosen a different resident during match? Self-reflection? Self-derision? Self-satisfaction?

I am deathly curious, pun intended. Residents grieve and blame the people in power. You, the people in power: what do you do?",medicine,1542540875,rumplepilskin,265,1,True,2018-11-18

Clinical Study Design?,"Hi all,

I'm an MSI and my lab tasked me with designing a clinical research project to study the incidence of various toxicities due to radiotherapy. I'll keep it vague to be less identifiable but it would be toxicities limited to one organ system. Part of why they would like me to do it is due to my connections to two other research institutions that would allow us to set up a multi-center study.

I am looking for it to be a prospective observational study assessing the incidence and gradation of the known toxicities to this organ system. 

Does anyone have any guidance on how to organize this? From my understanding, we will need 1) each institution's IRB approval to include prospective patients and 2) guidance provided to each department's clinicians regarding how to keep an eye out for these toxicities and how to describe/report them.

Star Wars themed parody of a 4th year medical student's EM application on SDN,"**Applicant Summary:**  
Step 1: 270s, Step 2: 260s  
EM rotations: H/H/H  
Inducted into Alpha Omega Alpha: Yes  
Medical school region: Outside the US  
Anything  else that made you more competitive: Former Jedi, did a ton of  mission  work on the outer rim before going back for medical school. Had  great  rotations, got great SLOEs.

**Main Considerations in Creating this ROL**:  Typical EM stuff, live  for climbing and skiing. Want to be somewhere  with academic resources  but county population and vibe. May potentially  be interested in  critical care, so would like to be at a brand name  program.

**1) Corellia County**  
Pros:  
One  of the most well known and prestigious programs, great pathology,  lots  of autonomy. EM and trauma surgery have a great relationship, EM is   very active in resuscitations as the only procedures trauma surgery has   dibs on are left sided lightsaber assisted thoracotomies. Plus you get   the chance to practice space medicine, you get your suit certification.  
Cons:  
Rough neighborhood, program is known for working long hours

**2) Naboo University Medical Center**  
Pros:  
Great  program, super academic but with tons of autonomy. Home program,  so I  know the faculty very well, super great bunch. Although it’s   technically an academic medical center, it is by all intents and   purposes the de facto county medical center for Theed. The other private   hospitals in the area don’t offer the same level of care for the   uninsured.  
Cons:  
Nit picking here because I love this program, but  huge Gungan population  (can be a challenging group to sort through the  somatic complaints to  find real pathology). Went to med school here,  kinda wanna check out  somewhere new, although would be pumped to match  here.

**3) Coruscant University**  
Pros:  
Old,  academic and well respected program. Big names in EM, powerhouse   faculty. One of the original county programs. Awesome city, would love   to spend the next 4 years in Coruscant.  
Cons:  
The program’s  location near the former Jedi temple is in sort of a low  yield area for  trauma as the imperials have been pushed out in favor of a  younger,  hipper crowd, and housing is very pricey.

**4) Revan Memorial Hospital - Dantooine**  
Pros:  
Well  funded, beautiful facilities. Bad ass faculty, fearless group.  Super  intense regional trauma center, residents work hard but learn a  ton.  Lots of research going on. EM runs the resuscitation bay, known for   doing more thoracotomies than any other program. Technically a private   hospital, but is the safety net for the surrounding region.  
Cons:  
Living on Dantooine would be boring, no mountains. Lots of farming accidents and speeder crashes.

**5) Hoth General**  
Pros:  
Great,  well known, one of the original county programs. Super cutting  edge,  always on top of the most recent EM literature. Also have some  huge  names in current EM. 2-1B has been on faculty there for years, and   literally wrote the book on bacta resuscitation.  
Cons:  
Hoth is a  pretty far into the outer rim, sort of hard to find, and is  super cold.  Not sure if I could deal with that much snow, although they  do have  great skiing.

**6) Korriban County**  
Pros:  
Super  cheap housing, and honestly while it may not be for everyone I  could  see myself loving living on Korriban. Lots of cool ruins to  explore,  ancient stuff to find, great mountains to climb (real classic  trad  routes). Also, program location is in the old Sith academy, so lots  of  nearby acuity, classic blaster and lightsaber club.  
Cons:  
SO  probably wouldn’t love living in Korriban, she says she’ll do it, but  I  see her happier someplace with better skiing. Also not the most   academic program, super blue collar ethos.

**7) Tatooine Planetary University**  
Pros:  
Actually  liked this program a lot more than I thought, as the only level  1  trauma center on Tatooine, they see a ton of pathology. On my  interview  day they brought in two herniating subdurals from Sand People  attacks.  The Program director is great, really makes you feel wanted.  And the  Sand People are super misunderstood, as well as having tons of  health  problems, really an underserved community. Some great crack  climbing in  the area too.  
Cons:  
Has a bad boarding problem, slow ED. Not as  prestigious as other  programs, plus Mos Eisley is a little bit of a  back water. Also the  Surgery Chair is a Hutt, so trauma is very surgery  driven, although they  are trying to change that.

**8) Mustafar Hospital**  
Pros:  
Old,  established program, great burn ICU with lots of resident autonomy.   Program director is super charismatic, really tempts you with the offer   to overcome death with him. Low cost of living.  
Cons:  
Not the  greatest place to live, super hot summers, dry winters, no great   outdoors activities. Seriously, you’d have to charter a ship to Naboo   to find the nearest skiing.

**9) Kashyyyk Medical Center**  
Pros:  
Only  residency in the hospital, so you get do do your own reductions,   ophtho exams, etc. Great training. Not very much acuity though, Wookies   tend to be super healthy up until old age, then start falling and   breaking their femurs.  
Cons:  
No mountains, I don’t really dig the  Mid-Rim vibes, people are so nice  to your face, but you know they’re  gossiping behind your back.

**10) The Endor Clinic**  
Pros:  
Awesome  peds ED, the local minorities are a super happy, friendly bunch.  The  forest moon seems like a nice, affordable place to raise a family.  
Cons:  
No  nearby climbing, the program is known to be sort of hand-holdey, not a   ton of autonomy. Not the most prestigious program, in fact most people   tend to pretend it doesn’t exist.

**Did Not Rank:**  
**Alderaan**  
LOVED  this program, great city, in the mountains, super close to skiing  and  climbing. Super bummed the planet got blown up, would have loved to  be  here.

Regular exercise in residency. A fictional tale?,"Lately I’ve been finding it difficult to exercise consistently mostly due to the demands of residency - my call is frequent, each week’s schedule is highly variable depending on my preceptor and often I’m so exhausted at the end of the work day that the last thing I’m thinking about is exercise. 

I’m feeling like a bit of a hypocrite, asking my patients to exercise more when I’m struggling w the same. 

I feel so much better when I do exercise and want to find a way to make it a priority and a consistent part of my residency life. Because the work day is so variable and somewhat out of my control, the only consistency is the start time for the day. Thus, I was thinking about trying to switching my workouts to the morning.  I’m not a morning person but am hoping that if I get in a routine I can make this a long term change.

Social Media Reviews,"Hi,

I recently started up my own Primary Care Clinic about 6 months ago. Since then, things have been going well and every single review that we have online, 41 and total have been all five stars (for Google and Yelp combined).

Well this week, we got our first and second one star review.

The first one came on Yelp. It came from a patient I've actually never met before. The review even starts,"" I've never actually been to the clinic or have met this position before. ""

This person complains that we shifted their scheduled time from 9:30 in the morning to 1 p.m about a week before her scheduled appt and she was extremely unhappy about this. She ended up no showing to her first appointment with us.

The second one came from a lady who no showed to her last three visits and complained that I wouldn't refill her ""seizure medications"" when actually she was on ativan for anxiety. At our last visit three months ago I requested the name of her previous psychiatrist or neurologist to which she could not provide me the names of either of these people. When I looked up on our prescription monitoring program, the only benzodiazepines prescribed to her were previously from other cash pay primary care physicians in the area. I tried calling there Clinic, and every voice mail I left has not been returned.


I decided to complain to Yelp and they refused to remove these reviews. In fact, when I called them they try to sell me advertisement space.

Besides replying to these reviews, any tips on dealing with these negative social media reviews? We can't lie to ourselves that almost every single patient I see tells me that they definitely review online reviews before they see me. I don't want to get caught up in the reviews but I can't help but let this bother me since I feel like I was practicing good medicine.

Can I call them out on social media that they were basically non-compliance? What are you strategies to dealing with negative reviews online?",medicine,1542638556,thrivepcp,35,1,True,2018-11-19
Scrub tech here- is it too late for me to do anything else?,"Hey guys. I’m a scrub at a huge level 1 trauma center. I freaking love it. I mean, I did one year of schooling and now I’m right in the middle of the action in crani’s and transplants.... how dope is that?!!?

As much as I love my job though, lately it’s feeling like it’s not enough. I want to do and know more. I’ve tried a few things to make it a little more interesting/get more involved. I ask questions about the procedure or anatomy or disease processes, but sometimes I feel like if I keep asking so many questions my surgeon is gonna get annoyed and lose it. You’re not there to teach me after all. I listen intently and learn so much when you’re asking the residents questions. I’ve been doing a little bit more assisting than I did at first but it’s almost never needed because 99% of the time there’s a resident or med student scrubbed in. I also periodically work with the local procurement teams because I get to do WAY more in a procurement than I ever would in a regular case.

But all that still isn’t enough. I would love to go to medical school but I’m worried I’m too old, too uneducated, and too Mom to do it. I’m in my mid 20s and my only education is high school and scrub school. I also have a child in elementary school.

So my question is, is it impossible? I realize you don’t know me but, if you had to guess, do you think it would be worth it? Should I settle for RN or PA or something like that? Any suggestions you have would be very helpful.

P.S. You guys are the shit. I’m sorry that so many scrubs aren’t pleasant to work with, I really don’t know why this job seems to attract so many people with attitude problems.

Anxiety/head rush that is triggered by movement?," Hi all,

I am not sure where to post this, or if this is even truly anxiety but it's the closest thing that I can compare it to. First some background and then I will do my best to explain what's happening. Medically I have been diagnosed with GAD. I take Cymbalta daily and it has borderline changed my life. I went from very bad anxiety to nothing at all. With that being said, I know what a panic attack feels like, general anxiety, ect. Now as far as this unidentifiable anxiety:

​

Ever since I was a little kid I get these 'head rushes' that are triggered by certain movements. It's a similar feeling to a panic attack, but more so just a falling feeling not like a, 'I'm dying' feeling. Either way, it's not pleasant. The head rush can be so strong that I have to just look up and wait for it to be over. Generally these movements are things that are coming towards me. Examples would be a ball flying towards my face, riding a roller coaster, running towards an object like a tree, someone talking and waving their hand across my face, ect. Strangely it always happens when my windshield wipers are on when it's raining. I've talked to doctors and therapists and also tried my best to search for some answers online and I get no results. Its always just grouped with GAD, but I think there's more to this. Does anyone have any similar experiences or know what this could be?",medicine,1542732064,beta211,1,1,True,2018-11-20

"Tax deductions for residency job search. Is my current job ""in the same field""?","Hello r/medicine !

Wanted to ask for your opinion on how I should file my taxes:

TLDR: MD working in biomedical research transitions to residency. Can the expenses related to residency job search be considered deductible under unreimbursed employee business expenses? 

I’m an MD, received my degree oversees. For the past several years I’ve been working as a research fellow at a research division of a large clinic. This year I took some time off work to complete some clinical rotations in another city to get some patient care experience. Now I’m in the process of interviewing for residency positions to transition to patient care next year. Throughout this transition I have some expenses: travel and housing at clinical rotations, fees for residency application and interview-related travel. 

I was wondering if I can deduct those expenses as unreimbursed employee business expenses. I know that medical  students don’t usually deduct these expenses because residency is their first job in the field. Now my question is whether my current job can be considered to be in the same field as medical residency from the tax standpoint.

Sometimes I feel dizzy,"Had a patient last week: Mid 20s, white male, 30 BMI, smoker, no significant PMH, no current medications.

Complaint of feeling dizzy sometimes.  His description of his dizzy sensation was pretty vague, no spinning sensation, no near syncope.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.  Sometimes the feeling occurred and he felt better if he ate something, sometimes the feeling would occur after he ate causing him to feel fatigue.  



He had been checking his blood sugar at home because he thought it may be getting low, his readings were 76-130. Vital signs normal. Normal exam.  He looks healthy, outside of being overweight and smoking I didn’t see any issue.



He later mentioned he also had issue where he felt like cramping in his lower leg and occasional numbness or tingling in feet, both of these problems occur at work after sitting for long periods of time.  




Checked some lab, CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, Vitman B12/D.




Vitamin D was low and B12 was close to low, otherwise lab normal.  



I recommended OTC vitamin D, B12, working on better diet, hydration, and sleep.  He wasn’t satisfied that I could not explain what caused his symptoms.  




Any recommendations?  I talked with the MD I work with and he didn’t really have any suggestions. ",medicine,1542764311,Make_believe_Doc,2,1,True,2018-11-20

"Feeling unsupported, unhappy with program","Lately I have been feeling unhappy with my program. Most recently there was an incident where a nurse filed a formal complaint against me, basically she didn't like the tone I used when responding to her complaint. Before I get off on the wrong foot here and sound like a jerk, I am always cordial and friendly with everyone including nurses and basically anyone I interact with in the hospital. I feel like we are all working for the same goal of patient care and everyone would be a lot happier if everyone was nice to each other. 

However, you obviously can't make everyone happy and this nurse was upset with me because i didn't grovel and apologize when I heard her complaints. She used a patient to basically support her cause for a formal complaint. Of course, she left the patient name out of the complaint and the patient was not the one who initiated any complaint against me. 

This honestly didn't bother me. I understand miscommunications happen and the nurse felt the way she did and that was that. What bothers me is that my program did not support me when I told them my side of events. It is incredibly frustrating to be in residency and have seen thousands of patients and one anonymous complaint is enough for my program to question me and make me feel like I can't rely on them to support me. 

I know that program directors have to take complaints seriously. I knew that I would have to discuss the complaint with them but I did not expect for my side of events to be dismissed. If I had a pattern of complaints I would understand but I have never had an issue with patient care or with clinical staff before. 

My program directors are still in clinical practice too so I guarantee they are aware that there will always be someone that does not get along with you or like the way you do things. I've seen them encounter plenty of patients and support staff that were unhappy with them for one reason or another. 

I also want to make clear that I didn't just dismiss the complaint. Obviously, I don't want to have a negative work environment with clinical staff and want to avoid this from happening in the future. I am just incredibly frustrated with how one small anonymous complaint has been the topic of discussion for me for the past two weeks. 

Not once in my residency have I received praise for my patient care, for staying late hours to make sure I do right for patients, for being a collegial resident, for being a team player, etc. Yet in the past 2 weeks I have repeatedly been reminded how this incident looks poorly on me as a resident. 

I just needed a space to vent my frustration.",medicine,1542905807,def_1,54,1,True,2018-11-22

Why don’t more hospital systems have data sharing agreements for EMR/EHRs?,"Lowly medical student, but am floored by this. I’m from a mid-sized city with several major (and competing) hospital systems. Most are on Epic, and you can click “Care Everywhere” to get info from the others. Even though the day to day of EMRs is awful...this element is great (per clinician report) as it requires no faxes, etc and saves time in some cases because you can get the ball rolling or at least know to call another facility for imaging results.

Since starting away rotations...I’m shocked by how many hospitals are truly JUST their own system. Most have been Cerner, but one was Epic. In some cases multiple hospitals are on one EMR/EHR platform...but you can’t see any of their records despite the fact that they’re down the street. One attending mentioned that the only “smart” city that has really addressed this was Baltimore, where every system truly can share data.

I’m assuming the answer is $$$....but it seems like data sharing would save money in the long term. My understanding is that LOINC even lets you share data between two different EMR/EHRs.

"Physicians, what is the best way for a RN (or any medical professional) to “respectfully disagree” with you?","I am an RN &amp; I run into problems like this from time to time. I’m also a float nurse so I typically will work on a new floor each day so I usually will only collaborate with specific MD’s on their patients for that day only. 

Here is the situation I was faced with the other day. Patient on day 4 of admission, some small cardiac history but for the most part a 60 yo M who comes from home where he is “independent” with his wife. Anyways, this patient comes in s/p multiple falls &amp; at this time is basically a social admission waiting placement for rehab. This patient was taking 1mg Alprazolam 4x a day for a few years. His benzos were stopped cold turkey &amp; according to the MAR he only received 2 doses of .25 mg po Ativan throughout the admission. So it’s day 4 &amp; this patient is delirious &amp; agitated to the point he’s a harm for himself &amp; staff. Anyways, I expressed my concern to the Resident early about having no Benzos &amp; the plan was to hold them at this time do the possibility of them being accountable for patients falls at home. The Resident was fairly stern that no benzos were to be given unless urgent. I said okay &amp; let it be at that, I have my own work to do anyways. Later on I speak to the attending about my concerns as well &amp; he reaffirms the POC. Psych was consulted &amp; benzos were okay to be held &amp; pt was started on po Haldol.  Once again, I leave it at that &amp; don’t make a big deal. Getting to the point, the pt later in the afternoon starts having what I believe to be a seizure ( involuntary shaking of upper extremities, eyes rolling in back of head). Of course the medical teaching team left at this time &amp; now I’m calling the on call resident who knows nothing about this pt. The Resident is skeptical of what’s going on because the pt stops having these symptoms as soon as I shake the pt &amp; doesn’t want to give benzos because the medical teams note says to hold at this time. So nothing is still done, I’m told to “continue to monitor” since he says it’s not a seizure if he can come out of it right away (I agree). Anyways, same thing keeps on happening. Pt once again starts involuntary shaking all extremities, eyes rolling in back of head etc. but will come out of it as soon as I aggressively shake pt. At this point, I wanted to just call a rapid so someone would take my concerns seriously. So anyways, I finally get the on call resident bedside who sees this is clearly a problem &amp; we get him some good old IV Ativan &amp; this problem is for the most part resolved. 

To me, this could have been easily avoided if I actually just said I completely disagree with this. But in my head I’m like “your the doctor, I’m the nurse” &amp; don’t want to step over any lines. Rarely do I ever think “I’m right, you’re wrong” but there are some times where I disagree with the current POC &amp; my concerns are not taken seriously. I already expressed my concerns so technically I can just chart I notified the MD &amp; just leave it be but there are sometimes where I feel like further intervention is 100% necessary but nothing is being done . Anyways, what do you see as a good way to handle situations where a nurse (or any medical professional) disagrees with what is going on even after they express their concerns.

It's a weird feeling at this point in my life because I am spending all this money on tuition, still in school, still having my bottom handed to myself. Everything about medicine, and learning to balance the student life, it's just very challenging. 

I love it. Sometimes I think about whether I made the right choice through. My peers from school, couple of them are in medical school, some became pharmacists, MOST of them went into finance and are data scientists making ridiculous $$$, even though they're all in their 20s still. 

The thought passes, comes and goes ever so often. Did I make the right choice? I see how everyone is ""living their lives"", doing whatever they want, going on vacation wherever, whenever. It looks nice. But, I can not see myself doing anything else. I want that MD. I think it's just about taking it one day at a time, and learning to better appreciate this wonderful field.

When challenged like ""What about a person 15 years free of clinical depression symptoms?"", the answer is always that it can come back at any time so it's not cured.

High blood pressure in the hospital and the role of PRN antihypertensives,"I'm only 5 months (already 5 months?!) into my intern year, but I've noticed that ""high blood pressure"" is the ubiquitous problem that's probably at every hospital in the country. I'm trying to get a QI project together about this issue.

Typical scenario:

Let's say I have a AE COPD patient with poorly controlled BP. At noon I get a page that his BP is 186/98 and that there are no PRNs ordered. This is not an isolated reading, his pressures have been in the 160s and 170s the whole time. He had an AKI on admission so his home losartan was never restarted. He's on his home 50 hydralazine TID. 

On physical exam he's pretty comfortable, no pain or discomfort really. Nothing concerning on a subsequent UA. We can pretend I wasn't terrible at fundoscopic exams and that I didn't find anything concerning on his retina or disk.

I start amlodipine 10 and make myself a reminder to check the next morning. I let the nurse know I'm not ordering any PRNs. The next morning it's still elevated, 160s/90s. So I increase his hydralazine to 100 TID. It settles down to 140s-150s rest of his admission. After that I was able to start lisinopril 20 once his AKI resolved.

- In this scenario, would you have done anything differently? (IV labetalol 10 PRN for SBP &gt; 180?)

It seems that a big reason we end up ordering these PRNs are to ""save us pages from nurses"", especially for our co-interns on night float. So the obvious next step seems to be educating the nurses making those pages. But before I can spearhead any educational initiatives I'd need to make sure that I know what I'm talking about in the first place!

Specific questions for physicians here: 
- When are short acting IV BP meds truly indicated?
- How do you handle ""high BP"" pages?

For nurses on here:
- Do you have any feedback or insight in general about high blood pressure in the hospital?

For all:

"After 8 months and $40,000 in lost wages I'm finally in network with Aetna","Hi everyone,

I decided to make a post since this whole situation has been totally absurd. 

3 years ago I graduated residency. I started working as a hospitalist and was credentialed with Aetna at the hospital to see patients.

About 12 months ago I decided to open my own clinic. I started the credentialing process about 8 months ago with all the major insurance payers. 

Everyone except Aetna had me in network with my clinic within 60 days.

Aetna verbally kept telling me that I'm good to go and that I can see patients.

I submitted in total about $40,000 worth of bills for Aetna only to get turned down as I was not in network for my clinic, only the hospital address.

Despite me having emails from a network manager saying I'm good to go to see patients for my clinic, they are denying all claims.

Today I got the news that they finally approved me to be in network for my clinic, despite me being in network for the past 3 years at a hospital location.

They have not given any good reason as to why this has been such a disaster.

I tried to argue that they should honor my previous claims and they are telling me that despite a network manager telling me in email (writing) that I'm good to go, that I never had a signed contract. And since I never had a signed contract, that I'm SOL.

So, on one hand I'm excited that I can stop seeing Aetna patients for free and starting billing to make money. On the other, my lawyer is all fired up about going after Aetna since I have clear emails that we are ""good to go"".


Going solo has been amazing except there has been some expensive lessons along the way.

If you are thinking of going solo, please wait until you have it in writing. So far I'm out a little over $40,000 in lost wages and basically gave care to over 300 Aetna patients for free.",medicine,1543197778,InvestingDoc,46,1,True,2018-11-25

The loneliness of doctoring,"In my 3rd year of residency, I have been extracting some of the finer elements of this job and have discovered how utterly lonely it is. And I'm strictly talking about time spent in the hospital, not lack of social hobbies, friends, etc. While that loneliness can be buffered by what we do after work, I'm wondering if this every really changes after training. These are the ways I feel utterly isolated at work:

By patients: drug seekers, conspiracy theorists, AMAers of all forms. Then there are the ones that are unintentional, the AOx1s. Then there are the ones that want to tell you how to do your job, or want to tell you what their discharge date is going to be.

By nurses: sometimes they are just as manipulative as the drug seekers. Many times they are doing it to advocate for their patients, but if something goes wrong the responsibility is on me. If I disagree, I am forced to perform a complex verbal dance so they feel heard. At the very worst it results in me actually giving a patient something he doesn't need, like the guy who had a phone log of his BP being 90/50 for the past 4 months, but the one nurse threatening to call an RRT for it every hour. How many times did I have to treat that nurse by giving this man IV fluids he didn't need? They feel free to interrupt our sign outs and conferences with calls, but we don't dare do the same thing to them. They get angry when our tasks increase their chances of staying late, but ignore the fact that we are almost never out on time because of the million little things that come up.

By other residents: there is so much less comradery between us because of the way the system is set up. We try to block admissions and turf whenever we get the chance. We are the megaphones of the attendings, but there is this lie each and every one of us tells the other that goes something like, we all know that you are only doing what your attending told you to do but you are supposed to make it sound like it's what you want to do and don't you dare play the attending card unless it's your very last resort. If the ED is admitting, if a resident is calling a consult to a fellow, if a resident is giving an admission to another resident, etc. The House of God stuff is absolutely real.

By the interns: the resident-intern relationship is possible the only saving grace of this whole mess, but you do feel that disconnect because you are no longer going through that with all the other interns. They have a social glue at work just because of what intern year is, but as mentioned above, the glue rapidly dissolves as the senior years roll by.

By the attendings: there's no big explanation here. You have to do what they say. Period. It's a boss-employee relationship. And you can be cool and friendly and try your hardest to change this, but it's simply the master-apprentice relationship and unless you are my mentor I do not feel any special connectedness with you.

By program leadership: willing to believe this is highly program specific. I noticed this early because our PD defends all existing policies and resists change very staunchly. They quote convincing data to prove their case, but when the next year comes and magically the change happens anyone no one asks about that convincing data anymore. This is a pattern I've noticed.

I guess if I had one word to describe all of it that is better that isolated or lonely, it would be adversarial. I feel like I always have to defend myself from one of the above and honestly after nearly 3 years I am absolutely exhausted. And that produces loneliness. 

Does this ring true for any others? I have heard that as an attending, the comeraderie of residency is one thing that is most missed. Does this make it even more isolating?

Good morning Meddit! A question for those a part of neurology/neuro critical care,"I’m a new grad nightshift RN in a surgical/trauma and neuro intensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center and Stroke center. While I was letting my patients sleep last night, I started to think. While I haven’t been a nurse for very long, I’ve met some individuals who are fairly young and had a devastating stroke. 

One of the symptoms that is troubling to me is expressive aphasia. So my question to you- expressive aphasia is merely the inability to form words, correct? If yes- why isn’t a language (Like sign language) taught to some stroke patients as an alternative form of communication? I feel like since it is a language based on movement and less on speech, the brain could be able to process what an individual is trying to say. 

Could be wrong either way! I am a new grad :) ",medicine,1543232297,ers53,0,1,True,2018-11-26

How would you feel about referring patients with chronic conditions to a Pharmacist for management?,"Would you feel confident collaborating with Pharmacists who work in the community, in order to manage chronic conditions such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, or T2DM? 

I ask this because we have a Physician shortage in Nova Scotia in Canada where I am from, and our professional associations and government are attempting to expand the scope of practice for Pharmacists in a number of ways, including Minor Ailments prescribing, and Chronic Condition management appointments/clinics. 

Is there a Pharmacist you work with/know who you would trust to manage your hypertension patients after you've diagnosed them? What would you be comfortable with them doing? Titrating doses, changing medications (within a class vs.changing an ACE to a CCB), what about deprescribing?

A lot of plans like this are going forward here, and I wanted to get a read on what Physicians think about them. Do you see it as us stealing the easier parts of your job? Do you think we should function independently?

[Serious] Is medical school worth it?,"\[26m\] I'll try to keep this brief.

My father is a surgeon and ever since I was a kid I wanted to follow in his footsteps. Unfortunately for me I didn’t appreciate the work effort required and the amount of focus needed to be a one. I went to college, I didn’t understand what it was I was being given, had a hard time focusing \[unmedicated ADHD\], didn't take my schooling seriously, and ended up barely graduating with a 2.3 GPA.

So I've filled lots of roles post graduation, I've done data analytics, some coding, did a contract job at google, did some teaching ect.

The problem is I still want to be a physician and I feel dumb for wanting that. My father has informed me that the ship for that opportunity has sailed and for a while I believed him. However recently a colleague of his has informed me that despite my poor performance academically that people have gone back to school and made it work. She told me that its not too late to make that change and sparked hope in me. I'm not sure if that's a good thing because now I'm actually thinking of making a plan to do it. I’m on meds now so now focusing isn’t so much of an issue for me and given my life experiences I can appreciate what opportunity I threw away earlier in my life.

I’m throwing around the idea of gunning for the Air Force and then trying to have the military foot the bill for my education. In an ideal world I wouldn’t want to take out loans for medical school so I’m thinking if not the military then maybe a school in another country. Thats assuming I can even make the cut which I'm not saying I can just magically do.

Can someone else weigh in on this? My father once told me that being a doctor is less about being intelligent and more about having a strong work ethic and I believe him. The guys almost 80 and he still does surgery. He has told me that the golden age of medicine has passed but apparently that hasn't deterred me.

Should I just put this all behind me and accept that I missed my opportunity/that its just not for me or is it still possible for me to take this option? Even if it is, does that mean I should?

He had a peritonsilar abscess drained about a week before.  I placed a chest tube and got a CT which showed a large empyema and mediastinal/peritracheal abscesses.  From there it gets screwed up because the patient is undocumented and the nearest cardiothoracic program is the Philippines.  The patient is admitted and treated appropriately, but needs immediate cardiothoracic care.  Turns out there are many hoops to jump through to get him the care he needs.  Its now been a month and we expect all of his documents to be processed this week.  Meanwhile, the organized empyema is residual, his WBC is normal, afebrile, and he's essentially symptom free (no pain, no respiratory complaints, walking around normally) despite repeat CTs showing stable/walled off mediastinal/peritracheal abscesses and a small residual organized fibrinic empyema.  In an ideal world, the guy should still be evaluated/treated by cardiothyoracics.  But...in the real world, he has a 5yr old US citizen son whose mother is incarcerated.  He can return since he's married to a US citizen and his child is a US citizen, but that takes at least a year.  After he's gone, the child will likely go into the foster system.

Healthcare Providers - What do you feel is the ideal role of NPs?,"Just something I'm curious to get opinions about from people in the medical field. I am currently an EKG Technician who will be an MS1 Fall of 2019. I've had lots of great and experiences with NPs along with some pretty terrible ones. For example, I've been seeing an NP that works with my neurologist for years and she does a phenomenal job. She has always taken great care of me and is very thorough with asking about history, gathering facts, and helping me make informed decisions about my health. On the other hand, I've run into a lot of instances where NPs seem to be operating a bit outside of their scope. The main thing I see is the ordering of a litany of tests on patients, many of which are confusing to me as to why they needed to be ordered in the first place. I have no delusion that I am more knowledgeable at this point than most providers in the hospital, but there are some things that just flat out don't make sense, and I don't at all savor the thought of patients leaving the hospital with bills much bigger than they should be. There has also been a vast increase in the number of NPs I see in the hospital within a matter of months, and I've been told that this is because NPs represent a more cost-efficient route of care that administrators favor. As someone who will be a physician within the next few years, I'm just hoping to get some more perspective. Nurses, NPs, PAs, physicians - what do you feel is the ideal working relationship between physicians and mid-levels?

A history about my self and hydrocephalus,"I came to this Reddit to look for the correct term of the history i'm going to tell you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in 1998 on may. 

I was a healthy baby. 

&amp;#x200B;

But about 8 months or so after i born, my mon started to look a deformation on my head, and some bulges in too. 

She went to the medic instantly. 

After some test and radiographs they saw i had water on my brain. Like a lot. And it was causing those deformations. 

&amp;#x200B;

All doctors said i was going to be able to walk or talk. And possibly die young. 

&amp;#x200B;

But one said this; Our only chance is the water gets absorbed by his spine. And then he will be a healthy child again. 

Some weeks passed and guess what...

Yes. Water got absorbed from my spine, every drop of it. And my skull returned to his normal size. And i didndt had any repercution.   
instead i talk and walk a lot haha   


&amp;#x200B;

But i always had this question, this condition or sickness that happend to me, was hydrocephalus ? Or how its called ? 

And the fact that all medics gave terrible diagnostics it means that what happend to me has low chance to happend to other kids with this problems ?

Marijuana use in patients on controlled substance contracts.," 

Hi all,

I'm a community based PCP in a state where marijuana is not yet legal. Sometimes I struggle with what to do when my patients on controlled substances either admit to or test positive for THC on routine drug screens.

I do not prescribe chronic opioids and the very few that are in my practice I inherited from other doctors and am tapering down or sustaining their prescriptions until they get into pain medicine. If they admit to marijuana I tell them to ""pick a lane"" and have no issue with tapering them faster off the opioids if they use marijuana. (since chronic opioids aren't effective anyway).

The thornier area is the ADD patients taking stimulants and the panic disorder patients and their benzos. I had a lady come to me in good faith and say she smokes weed every few evenings for her anxiety, but is otherwise high functioning in her job and thrives when she has benzodiazepine anxiolysis during the day time hours. While personally I have no issue with this, as a steward of controlled substances in this current medical climate aren't I forced to either taper them off the benzos or insist that they stop the marijuana? Or is this up to my personal judgment/shared decision making etc. Similarly, I have a few young professionals who have been treated for ADHD for 3 decades who admit to some marijuana use on the weekends--do they lose their prescription?

I'm just finding it difficult to navigate these situations, particularly as the winds of marijuana legalization are blowing. My tendency is to be somewhat liberal here, as long as there is no evidence of abuse or disorder. That said, I also don't want to create liability for myself unnecessarily.

What's your approach?",medicine,1539612857,skibbydibby,14,1,True,2018-10-15

Hormone/wellness clinics and ethics,"I've seen this occur on three different occasions, despite not doing malpractice so it's pretty bizarre. I am unsure what to do about it. The business model works as follows:

1. Advertise treatment for non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, lack of motivation, and reduced sexual drive. 

2. Once the patient arrives at the appointment, a testosterone questionnaire is given to the patient, again asking questions about symptoms such as fatigue, energy, sexual drive. 

One of the patients relaying his experience to me has a central sleep disorder and informed the staff of such.  He in his early 30s, was very fit and quite muscular and stated he had a very strong libido but otherwise scored poorly on the testosterone quiz because he was tired, etc. Based on the results of the questionnaire, a pharmaceutical representative wearing a white coat was then sent into the examination room. She stated based on the results of the questionnaire, he definitely had low testosterone and pushed a contract on him for for up to two years of hormone replacement for several thousand dollars. The potential risks were downplayed or simply not discussed at all. 

3. The patient felt very pressured but trusted the opinion of what appeared to be a legitimate medical office. Labs were ordered but prior to any results being obtained, a testosterone and hcg injection were administered to the patient the same day. 

4. The lab results came back showing all hormone levels well within the reference range. Because he had already spent well over a thousand dollars on the medication and based on the assurances he would feel and sleep better, he continued to receive weekly injections. He experienced no benefits besides some reduction in bodyfat and increased muscularly, however the patient was only interested in improving his daily energy. They also tried to sell supplements for absurdly marked up prices. 

He opted to stop without realizing he could not do so without guidance since the risks were downplayed and proceeded to feel depressed, had no libido for the first time in his life, and rapidly gained about 20lbs. He regrets ever going. 

The clinic in question seems to have locations in various states under different names. I believe you folks should be made aware of these places. These type of cases are not feasible to remedy through litigation. 

This practice model seems unethical and harmful to me but I am not a physician. I apologize if the post violates the rules (it seems as though it may since it involves a personal story). It seems to me if this conduct indeed is unethical, it will likely hurt the public's trust in medical care and should be stopped.

"I encountered my first bug chaser today and was frustrated enough to not want to treat the patient. I still did, of course, but man what a day. How do you manage the ""human trash"" kind of patients and resist judgement in your own practice?","Endocarditis consult today for a man who styles himself a ""bugchaser"". If you haven't heard of it this is a sexual fetish for pursuing infection with STIs. It is prevalent as a fringe subculture among homosexual men who prefer unprotected sex. Men pursue those with positive status in order to get ""pozzed"" or ""bred"", most often with HIV. 

So I'm called in to see this guy today and we get to talking about his extensive ID history because he's gonna need something done and this is a bitch of an operation for someone like me to think about as a bread-n-butter private guy mostly disillusioned with the culture of healthcare.  I'm working him up thinking I'm gonna try to transfer him to one of the major centers who have the ID team and ICU staff to take care of him correctly. We talk about how he contracted HIV. 

Turns out he has two different serotypes, on top of a few other things and he openly admits being a bugchaser. No big deal, I know what it is. You do you.  Thing is, he's also on medicaid and spends his days at home on disability and, in his words ""milking as much cock as possible"" 

Really started to piss me off inside. How can this walking public health nightmare be so angry at himself or society that he can sit at home and collect benefits while actively infecting others with HIV? 

For that matter why would anyone want to be a bug chaser? 

I try to withhold my own values judgements from patients and since I'm only a front-line doctor when I want to volunteer I can largely avoid things I don't want to mess with.  Some patients, however, like this guy, really strain my patience with their temerity. I hate that I used a term like ""human trash"" to describe someone. It feels like a violation of my oath.

My hospital is recruiting for euthanasia... how do you know if it's right for you to become involved?,"So the anesthetic department got an email saying that they are looking for some of us to volunteer to be part of the physician-assisted suicide program (which is legal in Canada). I fully support euthanasia but I'm not sure if I want to be part of the process. There is no obligation and I doubt they will care much if we all decline.

&amp;#x200B;

In my previous institution I spoke to a colleague who was part of it. She said that she signed up because she believed in it. She stopped after about 6 months because she had dreams about it - not nightmares, but obviously it disturbed her on some level. She didn't regret being part of it but she told me it was 'enough'. I thought perhaps that 'just because I eat meat doesn't mean I have to work in a slaughterhouse' - but I also wondered if perhaps strong beliefs in euthanasia need to be backed up with actions? After all, someone has to be part of the program, and not necessarily the most soulless person in the hospital who is willing to inject the person and walk out.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's just because it feels wrong to do the opposite of what our training dictates. In anesthesia we try and keep you alive, so it feels abnormal to actively do the opposite even if you feel like it's morally right.

Burnout...as an administrator,"I’m an administrator in a medical service line in an academic medical center. I know how “administrators” get talked about. I’m not sure how to impress upon you how unlike that stereotype I am, if that’s even possible. I left a 10-year career in an unrelated industry and obtained a graduate degree in health administration specifically so I could be in a position to help physicians. I wasn’t driven by an altruistic desire to make the world a better place, or even to help other patients. I was driven by my admiration for the work that physicians do and a desire to make their lives better. I don’t care about RVUs, revenues, productivity, and I’m in a position that fortunately doesn’t force me to care.

After 3 years working here, I’ve become incredibly discouraged. I’m unsure if it’s just the physicians I work with, but I’m discouraged by the biggest roadblock of all: the physicians themselves. A tiny illustrative example: the division head developed a new inpatient service that would also see two patients in clinic a day. They only wanted certain types of patients to be seen in those clinic spots. After in-fighting among providers, together we came up with rules for schedulers, brought them to the morning huddle, and everyone gave the thumbs-up. A few weeks later an attending on the service saw a patient in that clinic who she didn’t think should have been seen, chastised the schedulers at the huddle even though they had followed the agreed-upon rules, and the division head agreed with the attending. The schedulers brought the rules back to make sure they understood them correctly and the division head reversed course again and ratified that the rules were fine as-is.

That’s probably the tiniest example I can think of to describe the dysfunction I work within on a daily basis. But it encapsulates the inability to agree on things, the disregard for systems, and the lack of accountability or enforcement. Imagine the above but on a larger scale, played out with decisions that affect the entire department, physician deployment, division strategy, etc. The pattern is usually: 1) physician wants something 2) we present plan to make it happen 3) we work tirelessly to make sure everyone agrees on plan 4) we work to implement plan 5) physician(s) forgets the plan/doesn’t want to do it anymore/wants a different plan.  We’ve compensated for #5 by over-communicating to a delirious extent, but the amount of wasted effort and frustration is hard to describe. 

I bring up all of the above not because it’s the wisest thing to rant about providers in a subreddit about providers, but because there’s still a sliver of me that still cares. I still want to improve things for the physicians I work with and I think I just need to be better at it. I’m just not sure how. I’m hoping that there are some providers out there who might be able to recognize what’s going on, share similar experiences, and provide some advice on how to get a group of physicians who are otherwise incredibly pleasant people to work together and (to steal from Jerry Maguire) help us help them.

Being asked if your a Christian by patients and their families.,"I am an atheist physician working at a very catholic hospital (prayers offered over the intercom, mass, run by a board of Nuns). This hospital is located in a very conservative Christian town. I keep my own personal thoughts on religion to myself.

On occasion, while I am meeting with a patient, I will get asked (either by the patient or by the family member) if I am ""Christian"". Alternatively I will be asked to pray.  

This makes me uncomfortable because the only reason I can see them asking is because they equate being a Christian with being a ""good doctor"".

First off, I don't fell like it is an appropriate question and I shouldn't be compelled to answer.

Secondly, If I don't answer, that is effectively the same as saying that I am not a Christian.

Thirdly, I am worried that if say that I am not a Christian, or admit to being an atheist, I might be the victim of some discrimination (there are physicians and administrators at the hospital who have a reputation for only hiring Christians).

Crystalloid choice during rapid transfusion,"Does anyone have any experience running alternative fluid solutions to NS through a rapid infuser during transfusion. There appears to be one article that I can find detailing in vitro data and that the infuser can tolerate alternative fluids, but other than that I don’t see any data in humans or policy’s detailing what can be utilized. 

Specifically we are looking at plasmalyte as a balanced crystalloid option given that it doesn’t contain calcium like LR. It appears safe for the machine but we weren’t sure if there are long term drawbacks or issues in practice. 

Article in question: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26991611/

“BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic coil overheating, deformation, occlusion, and rupture during rapid infuser use have been previously reported. Although the etiology is unclear, prolonged machine use and reconstitution of citrated blood components with crystalloid solutions in the reservoir have been implicated. Lactated Ringer's (LR) solution is of particular concern as a diluent because of its calcium content. We sought to reproduce this failure mode using different infusion rates and different combinations of fluids for blood product reconstitution in the reservoir. We also introduced calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mix to determine its role in macroscopic clot formation.

METHODS: In this in vitro study, we conducted 2 series of experiments using the Belmont FMS 2000 rapid infuser and a reservoir. In series I, we submitted a mix of 1 U fresh thawed plasma (FTP) and 1 U red blood cells (RBC) with 500 mL of LR solution, normal saline, Plasma-Lyte A, or albumin 5% to a specific pump flow sequence. If neither a pump failure mode or self-shutoff (primary outcome) nor macroscopic clot (secondary outcome) was observed during a pump flow sequence, the sequences were repeated after first adding an additional 500 mL of the initially used crystalloid or albumin and then CaCl2 beginning with 200 mg and up to 1 g to the reservoir. In series II, 7 different crystalloid-blood product combinations were tested by using a variety of pump flow sequences with the same end points. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used, and data were reported as means ± SD.

RESULTS: We did not observe a Belmont pump failure mode (coil deformation, occlusion, or rupture) as previously described. In series I, the addition of CaCl2 200 mg resulted in macroscopic clots in 9 of 10 experiments (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.99). The time to clot formation was 9.1 ± 2.3 minutes (99% confidence interval, 6.74-11.46) and did not differ between solutions used for component reconstitution. In series II, adding variable amounts of CaCl2 to 4 different combinations of FTP/RBC with Plasma-Lyte A or LR solution led to clot formation. The use of only FTP in 2 experiments with either LR solution or normal saline resulted in formation of a fibrin clot. In 1 experiment of LR solution mixed with RBCs alone, no clot was observed even after addition of 1 g CaCl2. After the observation of clot in the reservoir, the fluid empty alarm occurred once in series I, the overheating alarm occurred once in series II, and the high-pressure alarms occurred 3 times in each series, all accompanied by self-shutoff.

CONCLUSIONS: In this in vitro study, we were unable to reproduce the failure mode characterized by coil overheating, deformation, and rupture previously reported with use of the FMS 2000. Addition of CaCl2 in the range of 200 mg caused macroscopic coagulation in the reservoir when added to crystalloids or albumin mixed with different combinations of blood products containing FTP.”",medicine,1539923368,s7evn,12,1,True,2018-10-19

Constant dissasociation,"21M 

I'll keep this brief. I've been having a ton of mental issues for nearly a decade now and havnt had the motivation to ever bother with treatment. I am mostly used to these issues and know how to live with them, but there are 2 issues that stand out and are worrying me quite a lot:

* Constant Intrusive thoughts: These used to be fairly mild such as thinking about punching someone or falling down, but over time they've become much, much more disturbing and violent in nature (eg rape, torture, rather not go into too much detail as they are really weird) and a lot more frequent.

* Constant dissasociation: similar to the intrusive thoughts, this used to be fairly mild but over time it has grown to be a lot more persistant and intense. I constantly feel like I'm in a 'dream' where everyone and everything around me feels fake and I just generally feel really disconnected or 'not a part of' reality.

Reason I'm mentioning this is because although I can kind of deal with this dissasociation issue, I get really nervous about having disturbing thoughts alongside it as normally with these thoughts I ignore them, but being disconnected from what's around me makes me think I actually will end up acting on a thought or seomthing.

AV fistula for non dialysis patients,"Background: Chronically Jaquie is a youtuber who posts videos about her chronic illnesses that she claims to have including EDS, POTS, MCAS among other diagnoses. States requiring 24/7 port access for which she administers IV fluids for her POTS and IV benadryl for MCAS and IV zofran for her nausea claiming to be related to her gastroparesis from ? also has j-tube for ""poor tolerance of PO intake""

She has become controversial in the chronic illness community due to her claims of multiple medical diagnosis that have been inconsistent and largely been uncorroborated. Suspicion for factitious disorder and doctor shopping for her to obtain unnecessary aggressive interventions including port, j-tube, and multiple hospitalizations/ED visits for unclear reasons at the same time of manipulating her health for youtube popularity. 

Anyway, in her recent video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnzl\_HYevi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnzl_HYevi8)) she states that she has had problems with accessing her port to meet her need for 24/7 access to give IV fluids, zofran, and benadryl. Thus, she now going to have surgery to get an AV fistula for chronic vascular access as required for her ""health issues"". This seems like an extremely aggressive intervention for problems that are have been optimally managed/explored. For instance, there is no mention per her previous videos of trial of midodrine and fludrocortisone for her POTS. Additionally, she has shown multiple times of being able to tolerate PO intake and it is curious why she cannot take oral benadryl or oral meds for her nausea. Zofran comes in both tab and liquid form and certainly is not the only medication that can be used for nausea. I suggest oral olanzapine for her as it is actually excellent for nausea and she clearly has mental health issues including anxiety. 

My question is have you every seen a patient with AV fistula NOT for hemodialysis? I have only seen a paper on AV fistula for hemophilia patients who require frequent factor infusions. Additionally, does her medical symptoms really warrant chronic vascular access and why AV fistula? She reports d/t her proclaimed EDS, ports will malfunction therefore she needs a more robust form of vascular access.

Persuading stupid patients about antibiotics,"I don't have much respect for laypeople thinking they know more about when antibiotics are appropriate than, you know, someone that was trained for years in medicine. It's disrespectful and I'm sure it's frustrating as hell. I'm by no means qualified to make that determination but I trust you folks are. But what I do know is how to persuade since that's what I do. 

These people don't give a shit about antibiotic resistance so using that argument isn't going to be effective. What they do likely care about is being fat and some research suggests antibiotic use is linked to obesity. How good is this evidence? Uh hell if I know but it's great from a persuasion standpoint in this context. 

It may actually be solid evidence as well. As a former farm kid, one of the primary reasons farmers use antibiotics in feed has nothing to do with disease. Antibiotics in feed makes animals fatter and they sell by the pound. It's a horrible practice but it increases profit. 

Just an idea. Thoughts?

Combined Nephro/Hospitalist --- how easy is it to get a combo job and what does it look like?,"Hey all. Thanks in advance for reading.
   
So I'm dead set on doing purely inpatient medicine in the future (I cannot stand clinic), and I only really like hospitalist (either academic or community, I could like both). I just finished a Nephrology rotation and I loved it. I talked to a lot of the fellows and attendings, and apparently many of their colleagues still do some hospitalist medicine on the side. I'm willing to do the clinic during fellowship obviously.    
   
I'm torn because I find Nephrology incredibly interesting, but I don't love medicine enough as a career that I NEED to do a fellowship. I'd be happy just doing hospitalist. However, the promise of learning lots of nephrology (which would obviously help as a hospitalist in the future and would be super interesting), and the ability to do Nephrology consults in-house is very tempting. Being able to do something else inpatient other than purely medicine wards is a very inviting idea, and I wouldn't mind the two years of pay cut at all, as I think being able to do consults would prevent ""burnout"" for a lot longer and keep me in medicine longer and thus earning more total money. I also really like that Nephrology is very much chart-review based and the history matters a lot less for most of your consults, and the physical exam very rarely matters other than volume status, which is a guess half the time anyway. I love that you very often already have an assessment and plan before you even physically see the patient.
   
How easy is it to get a job as both a hospitalist and inpatient nephrology consultant? Is it easy to get purely inpatient schedule with no clinic? I want zero clinic, unless it were bare bones like 1-2 days per month precepting fellows in their own personal clinic ; but again, that's not my ideal. An ideal would be something like 6-8 weeks per year of Nephrology inpatient consults, 10-18 weeks per year of hospitalist, and tons of teaching (academic or community is fine). Yes, those week numbers are arbitrary.    
   
Have any of you done this, or know someone who has? What is it like? As an aside, do any of you do a medicine consult service that you feel is different enough from hospitalist that it's a good break? Our medicine consult service sucks ass and is almost more draining for me than medicine wards. As a second aside, if I wanted to be a hospitalist at a rural hospital where I get to do all the procedures (I love procedures), can I just like...shadow an anesthesia attending while I'm an attending to get my intubation and central line numbers up? Is that a thing?

Personal question during a (US) residency interview,"Hey Meddit. I'm applying for a (US) residency position in small subspecialty known to be overwhelmingly conservative, white, male, and married. While I am a white male, and fairly conservative politically and fiscally, I'm unmarried and gay. I'm not out at work / to colleagues. I'm a fairly private person - prefer to leave work at work, and home at home.

Last time I interviewed for positions, I was repeatedly faced with a ""difficult topic"". It was phrased in a variety of ways, but always came down to the same thing: **Are you married? Is there a young lady? What's your relationship status? How many kids ya got?** Note that this was during the formal interviews with the attendings, not the ""drinks afterward with the current fellows"" shindig. 

Now, I'm always a big proponent of putting myself into the shoes of the other. And I trust my Attendings, even when they do things that are annoying or unpalatable. So my guess at potential reasons they ask, in no particular order: They want to see that I will fit in with the (very small) group. They want to make sure that I can commit long-term to a project / relationship /team. And they want to verify that I have a social support network for when things inevitably get rough in the coming years, in a city far from home.

That said, I am not so naive as to believe that, in a small field with a *high degree of homogeneity* among practitioners, there are not *correct* and *incorrect* answers to this question. Just like we all know of a few med school friends who can pull off a bit more alternative look - piercings, tattoos, hair color - most of us recognize that choosing to publicly display or announce these attributes *will invite the possibility* of being treated differently. 

**What would you do? What is a professional way to handle overtly personal questions during a job interview? How might the uniquely monopolistic hold that residencies have on the futures of young prospects affect that decision?**

As I see it, options include, in no particular order:
A. Truth: “I have a boyfriend.” (I believe this may be career suicide)
B. Lie: “I’m single / have a girlfriend.” (this has been my classic maneuver as of yet)
C. Confront: “I believe that is an inappropriate question sir, can we move on?”
C’ Nuclear confrontation: “That is illegal to ask during a job interview.”
D. Deflect?? (I’m all ears for this one, especially if I can make it into a joke)

Let me add, before this goes too far off the rails into a legal discussion: I’m pretty unlikely to litigate this. I just don't see it helping me, but almost certainly will hurt. Reporting discrimination is not a good option *at least until* I am in a more senior position in my very small subspecialty. Even if done anonymously, they will find out who it was, and my career will be over. I at least need to repay my loans before I strangle my future hiring prospects. This is why I pose it to this group - we recognize that certain Rights are not afforded to us as residents technically, even if officially.

I ask you, Meddit - what would you do?

MS1 with Questions about Pseudoscience,"Hi r/medicine,

I'm a MS1, and I'm getting pretty discouraged about the future perception of medicine. Everywhere I look, it seems like public distrust of physicians is growing, and doctors are spending more time convincing patients that they're trying to help them as opposed to simply providing care. This seems like it is happening to me because:

1. More patients are trusting in natural and unproven treatments, and seem to be seeing naturopaths and homeopaths more frequently than before.
2. Large prestigious academic hospitals are integrating these unproven treatments and advocating pseudoscience (Anti-vax statement from Cleveland Clinic Physician). I understand the argument of providing these treatments in a controlled environment, but I worry about the false equivalency that it provides these treatments by offering them at an world-famous institutions like Mayo Clinic, Duke, etc.
3. ""Sellout"" doctors that are selling unproven and natural cures for personal or financial gain, or even anti-vax doctors, which cause even more erosion between the public's trust of physicians.
4. The growing number of anti-vaccers, and the fact that recent polling shows that the public is slowly becoming more distrustful of vaccines. ([https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/388756-poll-support-for-vaccines-falls](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/388756-poll-support-for-vaccines-falls))
5. The proliferation and acceptance of pseudoscience from all fronts (Mercola, etc.)

I love this field, but I can't help but get discouraged about these trends and how it'll affect the future of medicine. Is there any way to defeat this growing acceptance of pseudoscience, or are we just going to forever be trying to convince people who have become 100% opposed to modern medicine? Can any practicing providers share some insight into how frequent this is in their daily practice? Thanks!",medicine,1540232942,HopefulMed,11,1,True,2018-10-22
Are your patients allowed outside to smoke?,"I’m just curious how other hospitals handle this. I moved from one large city to another, and got another job in an academic medical center ICU. One of my first weeks of work, I was told my patient was allowed to go outside to smoke cigarettes. This was a burn patient with multiple grafts and debridements. He was told by day shift RN that smoking may inhibit his wound healing and he understood the risks of that. MD wrote him an order, “OK to go outside” and the nicotine patch was d/c. Patient had an IV. I initially voiced my concern taking the patient and stating I don’t want to feel liable for anything that happens outside but I was assured by day shift that patients are allowed outside. I also don’t support my patients going outside for smoke breaks and I’m not sure why the hospital allows it. I was told, “This is the way it’s always been.” A majority of my coworkers smoke, so maybe that’s why no one seems to mind. So an hour into my shift, my patient comes back from outside with needles (caught on room camera) trying to shoot up. Security and house management were called. IV was taken out and MD d/c the order. Patient was discharged the next day. I’m curious if this is tolerated at your hospital.

Discussion - looking for tips from other physicians who sought care for mental health issues,"Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I've been seeing a therapist for about a year now following a tremendously difficult breakup of a serious relationship. I've realized though that I've probably been dealing with low level depression for the last 8 years (since the start of med school). I'm becoming more interesting in potentially starting an SSRI as I'm truly just tired of feeling this way. The day I realized I needed help was the day I was doing a PHQ9 with a patient and realized MY score was much higher than theirs. 

Anyways... I'm hesitant. I already had my disability insurance policy cut down and cost more because of having seeing a therapist at all and I'm worried about potential ramifications to my career. As of now, it's never affected me enough to take a day off of work and I had glowing clinical comments throughout residency and in my evaluations at my new job. I'm able to put in all my energy and effort at work and actually enjoy it but the second I get home I tend to just crash. I haven't been able to accomplish a single side project (in residency or at my new job) whereas I was previously a high achiever and very motivated and driven. 

I hate that I have to worry about these perceptions and I truly wish that physician's didn't have to both work such a stressful (physically, emotionally, existentially) job and then feel shame for trying to reach out when they need help. But... I feel that I should be cautious. I wanted to see if any physicians out there had received help for ongoing mental health issues and how it has affected their careers, licensure, etc. I purposefully didn't take a job I wanted in a certain state because their licensing questions were very prying into ANY treatment for ANY mental health issue :/ I don't want this to be a huge limiting factor on my career or have it be a major issue with licensure in the future.

Firefighter cancer: exposures versus lifestyle and demographic factors,"Firefighters are diagnosed with cancer 9% more than the general population and have a 14% higher chance of dying from cancer.

A big cause of the increased rate is what we are exposed to on the job. There are all sorts of nasty carcinogens in buildings. Even at the firehouse we’re exposed to carcinogens like diesel fumes and residual stuff on our gear.

I’m wondering how much of the higher cancer rate can be chalked up to lifestyle and demographics though. 

The fire service is failing at health and fitness. A good number of us are overweight or obese. Heart attacks are the number one killer of firefighters at emergency scenes. Our sleep schedules are jacked. There are mental health issues and PTSD. The stress of the job itself.

I also wonder how the demographics of the fire service relate to the cancer rate. For example, firefighters get testicular cancer at roughly 2x the rate of the general population. However, being white is a risk factor for testicular cancer and the fire service is disproportionately white.

My layman’s theory is that lifestyle factors have a significant effect on the firefighter cancer rate, in addition to exposures to carcinogens. Does that make sense or am I full of it?",medicine,1540311192,curiousfireman23,10,1,True,2018-10-23

"Family medicine resident having regrets about career choice, feeling de-valued - is this common in all specialties?","I'm a family medicine resident in an urban setting in Canada at an academic centre.

I initially went into family because of the breadth and challenge of seeing undifferentiated patients and working them up as well as having that longitudinal relationship.

Now into my residency, I feel like I either lied to myself or was grossly misled about the specialty. Most patients come in, anxious with non specific complaints that I'm forced to go through the mental exercise of coming up with a differential for, that end up being nothing. Cannot tell you all the useless bloodwork/tests that are done just to ease their anxiety.

My preceptors are not overly knowledgeable either. Most of the time if I don't know what it is, they don't know and end up referring so I never make that mental connection with a presentation and end diagnosis even if it theoretically should be pretty simple. Some of the referrals that I've been forced to make are almost laughable. I am not learning any medicine or pathophysiology.

At least once a day, I am met with a patient who presents with a list of bloodwork that some herbalist/naturopath/chiropractor wants them to do. I know fully well that these ""professionals"" are unable to interpret the results or do anything with them other than make up a treatment. Yet my role as a family doctor in those instances just gets devalued down to  being a puppet for people who don't even have ordering rights. I will have at least one other patient per day who shuts down my recommendations or advice and say ""you know I've done a lot of my own research and actually \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is best. Not a lot of people know this but it's true"".

The worst part is no matter how rude patients are to me, I am always expected to maintain professionalism or bend over backwards to ""maintain rapport"".

What am I doing here? I did not go to med school to not know medicine, to constantly reassure anxious people, or to work FOR pseudoscientists. Is this common in all specialties or should I be looking at making a switch? I should add that I am otherwise very happy in my program in that most staff are supportive and my coresidents are great. My quality of life is great but I am not feeling intellectually challenged at work.

Do You Ever Change Your Accent?,"I initially trained in big centers in the midatlantic / north east. I'm now at a new hospital in the south and for the first time I've started to incorporate some southern dialect into conversations with people with a southern accent. It's not part of my normal speech, but around really southern patients, the accent helps -- and I can't help but bring it out-- eg. I've learned to 'y'all'. 

Part of me feels like I'm being disingenuous and 'faking it' to make my patients like me. I don't talk like this at home, maybe I shouldn't do it with patients?

But at the same time I also feel like it's absorbing the culture and using it -- almost akin to learning Spanish so that you don't need to use a translator phone (and can just talk to the person the way they're used to communicating).

#DoctorsAreDickheads,"I was wondering how many others here on /r/medicine came across the #DoctorsAreDickheads hashtag on Twitter over the past 2 days.  On one hand, I appreciate that people are sharing stories of their mistreatment and/or dismissal by doctors.  This is a large and serious problem, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized populations.  But on the other hand, I can't believe that anyone who uses that hashtag is truly interested in engaging with doctors in a constructive way.  Seriously - who insults their target audience in the opening of a conversation?

I'm also frustrated that some of the related threads imply that the erosion of the doctor-patient relationship and mistreatment of patients is a worsening trend.  I don't have any data to support this, but from my experience, this is hard to believe.  Yes, clinically-useless administrative tasks, dysfunctional EMRs, and excessive emphasis on RVUs and metrics all reduce our empathy for our patients, but this is offset by the significant increase in emphasis that med schools are now placing on interview skills, rapport-building, shared decision-making, and the treatment of vulnerable populations.   There was zero training in any of that when I was a student.

None of this means that physicians don't have room to improve.  Of course we do.  But calling us names isn't going to help further this goal.

I started feeling more burned out reading the hot takes on this on Twitter, so I decided to see what Meddit thinks.

Needlestick injury HIV positive source,"Hi so I’m an endocrinology resident in an Eastern European country, and I’m currently on my diabetes rotation, and we have to inspect patients’ insulin pens to see if they’re functioning properly. The other day, I pricked myself with a Novo pen used to inject fast acting insulin last used about two hours prior to me checking it, it was very bent and went straight into my finger after I removed the safety cap. It didn’t go in deep, but some blood came out. I used some alcohol left behind by the nurse to clean myself and then let some water flow over maybe 2 minutes later. The patient initially did not disclose his HIV status -which he was aware of- in fact, only when I told him we would test him for HIV and hepatitis B and C did he admit to having HIV. His infectionist decided not to put him on HAART due to his high CD4 count.
I was able to start PEP within a two hour window and I am currently on a 4 drug regimen, no side effects so far. The folks at the infectious diseases hospital searched for this patient in their database and found that his last viral load (in December) was 100000 copies/ml.
I am aware that the risk of me getting HIV is extremely low, especially since I started PEP on the same day, but I would really like some further reassurance, since there are moments when I am scared shitless.

I'm worried about my attitude,"EM PGY3 at 3 year program
I never used to be this way. I was always a pretty happy-go-lucky person, had my responsibilities but was somewhat carefree and enjoying life. It's all changing now. I've gone from interested in my patients to growing disinterest and in the worst cases some internalized disdain for some of them.
I love patient's who I can help. What can I say, I still like to feel useful. A reasonable person who is scarred or hurting and wants to be checked out...I am all over that. They are the only saving grace in what has become a monotony of progressive and concerning (to me) cynicism. I never used to be cynical.
I start my day and just dread hearing all the EMS patches, and see the waiting room fill up with ""dizzy"" ""multiple complaints"" ""fatigue"". I am developing disdain for the family that drops off their 90-something year old relative because they all of the sudden can't care for them at home. We refuse to take grandma home, just admit her for 3 days so she can get a qualifying stay. what do you mean there is no diagnosis? What difference does it make, just admit her, we won't take her back. I feel for the hospitalist too. What can they do with a person who is old and slowly dying. Oh but of course lets refuse to make her DNR because...just because.
I should say that I am always polite, smiling and respectful and professional to my patients. Even if I think your complaint is BS, like ""I almost felt dizzy the other day and really think I need an MRI"" then proceed to require 40 minutes of education as to why you don't need an MRI and meanwhile you are unsatisfied because I won't just MRI you and while I'm spending 40 minutes with you EMS has brought in 5 more weak and dizzy 90 year olds.
Sometimes, like Dr Cox said
that's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive that should have died along time ago, back when they lost what made them people. Now your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain dead that you can't function
Only I feel like I'm getting so cynical I can't function. I'm afraid to let it go on like this. But I don't know how to stop it. I don't want to live this way. I want to help people. I'm afraid if it continues I will lose my professionalism and no longer be polite and courteous to patients who I feel have BS complaints.
I know that it is absurd really. To them their complaints are not BS. They really are worried and that's why they've been waiting (which they're also pissed about). I know this intellectually, but my soul won't listen to reason. I feel like I'm slowly dying inside and I don't know how to stop it.
I don't have a history of mental illness and I'm not thinking about hurting myself or anything. I don't know...I just don't know what to do. I want to renew my passion for learning and medicine.

I am part of a team of scribes at our local ER. We have had great success over the past several years with quality scribes helping our ER docs improve their speed and efficiency.

The only problem we have run into is these scribe companies that hire the team are very expensive. They run our program and are in charge of every aspect of it including quality control, training, pay, provide insurance to full time employees etc.

Has anyone ever thought of ditching these huge companies in favor of running your own independent scribe program? Maybe under the hospital name?

Ob/gyns and surgeons: your opinion on residency surgical training and resident autonomy in the OR?,"So I am very interested in ob/gyn. However, I was kind of disheartened to hear about the state of residency training. That is, it seems that nationwide, there has been a switch from long periods of time in a certain rotation (i.e. 12 mo on gyn, 12 mo on ob) to now quick 4-5 week long ones, switching also among institutions/hospitals. This change, according to a doc I spoke with, has severely limited the attending-resident relationship such that attendings do not know residents' skill level well enough to let them do more in surgery. Also, with such quick rotations, there is never an opportunity for ""deliberate practice."" Further complicating matters, at least in obgyn, is the decline rates of hysterectomies, so there are fewer cases to go around. Apparently a lot of recently graduated obgyns (and an anecdotal vascular surgeon) don't feel adequately prepared to handle all surgeries once at attending. It is telling that many general ob/gyns refer something benign like endometriosis to gyn oncs b/c their surgical technique is just not where is should be. Basically, it seems that to go into surgery or obgyn, a fellowship is basically required, if not to just find a niche, then just to play catch up on skills that were supposed to have been learned before.

What are your thoughts on this matter? Is there any way residents can still acquire a high level of surgical competence/skill under the current system? I would hate to go into a residency and feel unprepared coming out.",medicine,1540644872,soaringnflyin,4,1,True,2018-10-27

I drive about 1k miles a week In a comfortable car.
And walk quite a lot as I have two dogs.
I eat relatively healthy.
I like cheese though! Hmmm cheeeeese.

Anyway I'm just getting a bit concerned as a few months back I became aware of it and then I forgot about it for a while and lately I have been more aware then ever, to the point I feel like I feel it whilst typing this.
Its subtle but enough to notice.
I also feel like it could just be in my head because when I don't think about it I can't feel it? Or is that just the same with anything.
Any advice or information would be appreciated
Or even if you also feel stuff like that yourself and its normal let me know! Thank you so much for your help in advance !!!

Does this urethra problem have a name and has anybody healed from it?,"I am male.

When I was healthy, I had 2 states of urinal sphincter system: normal state, that was at most of time, and urination state, that was only during urination.

I used to masturbate. Once, i decided to make an experiment and do it while having morning boner with full bladder. As I remember, I always had full bladder while having morning boner. I started to masturbate and at some very stimulated point I felt that i need to urinate and I decided to make another experiment: to urinate at that very stimulated phase of penis. I urinated, and i did not feel any pain. After I stopped to urinated i have felt that my urination system has not come back to normal state; it has been left at urination state. It is like my urination sphincter is not closed, urine is going out.

I have read some texts and have known out that there are internal and external urinal sphincters. They say, internal sphincter is not regulated with conscious mental commands.

Muscles become shorter and thicker when they contracted. So, urethral sphincter should stay contracted most of the time, in order to stay thick and so close the urethra.

Maybe, my internal urethral sphincter is torn, and so, it cannot close urethra, and urine goes out through it and thus I feel that urination state.

Many years have passed and I am still have this problem. This maybe partially because torn sphincter cannot heal by itself because it stays contracted most of the time, thus, muscles are shortened most of the time, the tear stays open, muscle's torn ends do not contact with each other. Sometimes I feel some weak ache at that place.

How internal urethral sphincter can be torn? I think of it this way: bladder has much of muscles, and it must be more powerful than the sphincter. If bladder pushed urine out while sphincter tried to close urethra, to close in order to keep urethra open for sperm, bladder might win and urine pressure might tear the sphincter muscles.

Maybe, my internal urethral sphincter is not torn, but does not contract due to it does not receive signals from nerves.

I do not have urine constantly flowing, seems I keep it using external urethral sphincter. But, it starts to leak if I squat and stand up; and it starts to leak if i hear an unexpected or a loud sound, and it starts to leak after several hours after peeing. I think, these might be because the external sphincter maybe is not designed to strongly keep urine.

I have found that this condition was experienced by somebody and is described on the internet: see, he says ""mess up your valves"":

[https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080617115807AAHQC3r](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080617115807AAHQC3r) : scout485: NO, your body has a built in valve system that closes off the ureters from the urethra and opens it to the sex glands (gonads, cowpers) when you are fully erect. You can pee when you are engorged, but not fully at erection. And don't try peeing when fully erect, you can mess up your valves. Just wait till the shaft goes back down from verticle.

Problem in healthcare institutions,"Hi, I’m a high school senior who recently finished an internship at a large pediatric hospital. I’m not sure if it’s ok for me to post here, and I won’t again, but I noticed something while I was there that I found quite disturbing. I shadowed around in multiple specialties such as neurology and emergency department, and found that there was quite a lot of people, mostly disadvantaged poor, utilizing the services of the hospital, overnight stays, ambulances, etc. as a sort of getaway from their lives on the outside without any real symptom or ailment, and even blatantly faking symptoms. A parent of a patient even attempted to argue with chief of neurology on the basis of seizures and such. It was painfully obvious, at least to me, that there was simply no truths to her claims. One doctor noted to me that this was common and I began thinking that this must be a serious issue then as it is taking valuable time and resources away from the majority who are sick and in need of care.

"Input needed to deal with ""problem"" fellow.","I'm being vague and using a alt account for privacy reasons. 
Our new fellow is quite a handful. 
Knowledge base is acceptable. This is a trainignporgaram so we anticipate deficits and aren't too bothered about this aspect. Overall very friendly and amiable. 

Things where this person is really driving us nuts :

* often misses histroy/ clinical exam findings. We have remained this person again and again, but same mistakes. 

* now sense of prioritizing tasks. 

*any unexpected challenges or unusual situations gets flustered and literally runs away fom the task. In fact this person even calmly walked off a ongoing rapid response. 

*nothing is ever this person's fault. Some  excuses : Too many patients, I forgot this detail. I didn't think this was important so I didn't ask/persue. Too basic. Too complicated. Residents should have done this. I used to teach residents and med students, why are you treating me like one. You never pick on the other fellows. Too much work. Too much work to review charts everyday, I don't feel like a real doctor. (on light rotations) nothing to do this rotation, socouldn't learn anything relevant.

* zero insights into shortcomings. Constructive criticism is viewd as a personal attack. 

*cognitive errors abound - has a real issue with Aggregate bias. Gets stuck on some mundane aspect of the clinical picture and asks for increasingly absurd levels of references. I once spent 30minutes trying to get my point across. Apparently I learnt that personal experice and a old textbook are more valid then up-to-date , pubmed, WHO and CDC guidelines. I gave up on that conversation. 

* terrible sign outs, even on the person's own patients. Vage and includes mostly  information  which this person perceives as important. 

*remedial sessions and constructive sessions end in  This person crying and accusing the faculty of discrimination. Emotional balckmailabounds. 


I really feel for this fellow and the department is trying to help this person.

 Any suggestions before taking the step of terminating/not renewing the  contract?

57 Year-old Layperson Wants to Work in Medicine for Underserved Population,"In the early 80's I was headed towards my goal of becoming a physician.  I graduated with a degree in chemical engineering with a premed option and a certificate in Biomedical Engineering.  I attended 2 years of graduate school in neuroscience with the intent of going to medical school after I received my Master's Degree.

Then life happened and I recently retired from a 37-year career in aerospace (long story).  My plan in retirement has been to give back to the community as a volunteer (which I've been doing), but I am not finding enough ""life purpose"" in this.  A part of me regrets not staying the course in medicine and I sometimes dream about being hands on serving the poor and underserved in need medical care.  Money is not an issue and I would gladly work for free.  I dream of working in a free clinic and going on medical missions oversees every now and then.

I know getting an MD is not practical, but I've toyed with going to school for Family NP, or PA training.  I already have EMT training, but I figured out that's not what I'm after.

Do doctors have a responsibility to look/be relatively healthy?,"Question in title. I was talking with some fellow students about this today. Obviously, not being obese and being a nonsmoker is *healthier*, but they seemed to virtually take it for granted that a doctor who looks fit/doesn't smoke etc. is *better for patients* when dealing with problems like obesity or smoking cessation, because they ""lead by example"" -- sort of an extension of the classic parenting problem, ""do what I say, not what I do"". Skin in the game, I suppose.


They spoke of their own experiences in whose advice they tended to take seriously, and generally agreed that they listened more to people who practiced what they preached. Which is fair enough, I guess you'd want e.g. your personal trainer to look like they work out a lot, but do patients really look to their doctors as inspirational models in the same way? I couldn't help but notice that this was coming from a bunch of very fit mid-20s people. Obesity carries a great deal of stigma, overweight people are often very ashamed of their bodies. It seems to me that perhaps it also makes it more difficult for a sixty year old cab driver to take advice if their physician looks like they run marathons for fun -- because of the stigma, or a perceived lack of ability to sympathise with how hard losing weight is, or because they simply feel more kinship/shared hardship. I imagine having some ubermensch list all the ways in which you need to improve to be healthy might actually be pretty demoralising and demotivating.


I'm not suggesting doctors should be unhealthy for the sake of their patients, or that patients should only be treated by physicians that look like them, or anything ridiculous like that. I'm just curious whether the physician's appearance has an impact on patient compliance/motivation/emotional well-being, what it's like for the patient to meet a doctor who has some personal experience with their troubles vs. someone who seems to have their shit together perfectly.",medicine,1540917449,coasttablet,296,1,True,2018-10-30

Clinic Manager Questioning my Practice,"Throwaway for Obvious reasons.   
Location : Northwestern USA. 

Recent graduate of a dental school, almost working for 1 year. Love the job, difficult at times but overall very satisfying. Upon graduation I stupidly joined a chain practice and recently one my local branch managers has been auditing my charts and asking why I don't preform certain procedures and why I don't bill insurance for it. The branch manager has no formal education in dentistry.  As you can tell, profits are taking all precedence here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was contacted early in September and was told the manager was going to audit all my charts. Was also told I am supposed to leave detailed descriptions of how many patients I saw, to how many i preformed a certain procedure , for how many I haven't and WHY I didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't have any issues in my first year on contract with this chain company. Then they hired a new manager in April and my issues began a few months later, roughly in June. The unfortunate part is since I didn't have any prior issues in the previous year, thus I renewed my contract for another year. I currently have 6 more months before it expires. My old manager who was fantastic has been replaced by this new clinic manager. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you recommend I do ? Naturally I want to quit since I dont like being questioned, don't like pushing any ridiculous things on to patient and MOST importantly its my license number in my state.. I do not want to jeopardize it. 

\*Questions\* 

For those who have been in a similar position what would you do? 

Or in general what would you do ? 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you subsequently apply for jobs and explain to them that you terminated a contract midway through its commencements. 

Should I go to a lawyer and ask them to look over my contract to see what way is the best to get out of it?

Clinic manager questioning my practice,"Location : Northwestern USA.

Recent graduate of a dental school, almost working for 1 year. Love the job, difficult at times but overall very satisfying. Upon graduation I stupidly joined a chain practice and recently one my local branch managers has been auditing my charts and asking why I don't preform certain procedures and why I don't bill insurance for it. The branch manager has no formal education in dentistry. As you can tell, profits are taking all precedence here.

I was contacted early in September and was told the manager was going to audit all my charts. Was also told I am supposed to leave detailed descriptions of how many patients I saw, to how many i preformed a certain procedure , for how many I haven't and WHY I didn't.

I didn't have any issues in my first year on contract with this chain company. Then they hired a new manager in April and my issues began a few months later, roughly in June. The unfortunate part is since I didn't have any prior issues in the previous year, thus I renewed my contract for another year. I currently have 6 more months before it expires. My old manager who was fantastic has been replaced by this new clinic manager.

What do you recommend I do ? Naturally I want to quit since I dont like being questioned, don't like pushing any ridiculous things on to patient and MOST importantly its my license number in my state.. I do not want to jeopardize it.

\*Questions\*

For those who have been in a similar position what would you do?

Or in general what would you do ?

How do you subsequently apply for jobs and explain to them that you terminated a contract midway through its commencements.

Should I go to a lawyer and ask them to look over my contract to see what way is the best to get out of it?

Naturally , I want to quit, this is toxic and I hate having someone question my treatments.

RICE method outdated for scaphoid surgery recovery?,"Some of might have been seeing my posts about scaphoid surgery and bone healing. Well, I had my surgery this morning. The doctor is telling me to keep the wound elevated, which is of course part of RICE (rest, ice, compress elevate)

For a lengthy read (https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1092791/download).  From the NBPAS's letter, the DOJ opinion addressed a Maryland bill promoting competition, saying the ABMS Program on MOC may essentially harm competition and increase the cost of healthcare to customers by imposing burdensome conditions on physicians wishing to maintain their certification.  This is a nice blow against the ABMS, a for-profit body putting unnecessary burdens on physicians without appropriate outcome being demonstrated as a result of the hurdles we have to overcome.

Apologies on behalf of my ignorance/administrators.," I  weighed in briefly on a post yesterday regarding nursing ratios,  since I am not 100% aware of clinical variations in hospitals, it was good to read about how bad some hospitals are in the country. My main concern wasn't about the ratio - it was mostly around the rule going live in 3 months and that non-abiding hospitals are charged $25k/day as a penalty  (not sure where that $ is going, I'm guessing to the state fund?). I  want to leave that issue aside though, since it's not why I'm posting.

I  didn't realize how many providers truly HATED non-clinicians. They say  when you've worked in one hospital, you've worked in one hospital.  That's true for me (I've only been at one institution), but I feel like  my organization does generally a good job in supporting clinical staff  based on my conversations with them, and I guess I don't know what it's  like in other hospitals where your management team really just is about  nothing but money.

Anyway, after being  told that I'm a parasite, a leech, etc. it seems clear to me that  administrators as a whole have to do better.

I  don't know where these admins come from that make you treat patients  differently based on ability to pay (we blind our docs to that  information) and I'm truly sorry any time that you've had someone tell  you how to do your job, disrespected you, or took the joy out of caring  for patients. I've only been in this industry for one year, and I find reading through comments about burnout, ratios, even just random  clinical issues to be really interesting and reflects a great community.

I'm  assuming this might be downvoted to oblivion, since I'm just an admin.  But the conversation has to start somewhere, and I hope that I can take  lessons from here on what NOT to be and we can work together to help  patients. Thank you.",medicine,1537013083,LFCreds,88,364,True,2018-09-15

Women Physicians: considering the impact of a medical career on family and relationships...would you do it again?,"To all my lovely (family-oriented) ladies out there, looking back, do you regret pursuing medicine when you look at the impact it had on starting a family and your relationships? 

Throughout my undergrad, I was always focused on getting into medical school, resume, EC's, the pre-med stereotype. I never placed much value on pursuing boys or relationships, believing that if I focused on my personal development, I would find the right guy eventually. But I have always maintained the sentiment, since probably the time I graduated high school, that while I want to be successful in my career, but ultimately my dream is to start a family with the man I love and have babies/raise kids. I've been working my ass off towards this goal of medical school not only to enter a career of helping people, but also to achieve the eventual job stability and financial stability that is important in starting a family and raising kids. 

Which brings me to my little crisis as to if medicine is truly the right place for me (right after starting at my dream medical school, good timing I know). I'm smart, accomplished, and decently attractive (not gorgeous but pretty enough, although I have my sense of fashion and makeup knowledge going for me) yet never have even had  a serious boyfriend. Sure I've been asked out, but I've never put in enough time/effort to make it happen really. Ideally I'd like to be married and have a family by the time I'm 30ish, and the more I read articles and hear stories, the more I think that this ideal is almost impossible in medicine. 

So I'm asking all my female docs in residency and attendings out there: if you could go back, would you do this again? Or would you pursue PA, or perhaps even a completely different field like engineering, where you have similar financial stability but more time for yourself. 

Also: It should go without saying that I'm not trying to to say that every woman necessarily needs a family and husband to feel fulfilled. Some of my most inspiring female mentors have neither, but at least for my personal values, this is something I am not willing to compromise on.

PRVC would have been perfect for this patient (restrictive lung disease (effusions + consolidation / collapse / atelectasis) with some ARDS in the setting of acute necrotizing pancreatitis) but the vent just seemed incapable of measuring flows and volumes accurately enough to achieve this. I watched it do the stepwise increasing test breaths, and made sure the Pmax was at least 5cmH20 above what I was willing to let it do, but the volume measurements were just not reading accurately and the CO2 curves were non-existent / very low. The sync / triggering was terrible despite adjusting the trigger sensitivity. In the end I just muscle relaxed the patient and put him on a mandatory pressure control mode. Even then the vent would not give me any idea of the flow curve, tidal volumes or etCO2. The standard tubing does seem quite long, so I wondered whether compliance in the circuit was a issue. We tried reducing the dead space as much as possible. The other inline etCO2 sensor we had was working great. I just wish we had a third party flow / volume measurement device as well! It was a 6 hour flight between good ventilators, and I fear we did this man no favours whatsoever. 

Help! I think I am stuck with using these vents in this job despite voicing my concerns. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

How to get an appointment at the mayo with no referral??,"I am having serious issues with my eyes.I am only 24 but have been diagnosed with blepharitis, dry eye, and map dot fingerprint dystrophy although I am very skeptical of the last one.Essentially blepaharitis is a bacterial infection which antibiotics took care of, but map dot fingerprint dystrophy causes abrasions to the eye, usually harmless in the outer layer of the eye seen in the elderly usually.I've seen two optometrists, one opthalmologist.I am skeptical of the map dot fingerprint dystrophy because I have scarring and visual loss which is not consistent with this disorder, or with my age.My opthalmologist will not make a proper referral to the Mayo although I can hardly see well enough to drive again at 24 years old.At most she will say I am seeking a second opinion.That place has all my records, they just want a legitimate referral.I live in Minnesota just a few hours from Rochester and have excellent insurance.The fact I can't get care in this state with blue Cross blue  shield and literally slowly going blind is irony.If there is some work around without seeing 17 more eye doctors until one finally admits that the shoe doesn't fit I'd appreciate any suggestions at all at this point, especially if you've been seen by the Mayo yourself.I feel my eye doc is being very egotistical and dragging her heels because in the last appointment I made it pretty obvious I'm skeptical at this point (seen 3x condition only worsening).Even the staff at the Mayo were amazed that she refuses to write a referral with scarring on my eyes.
She is the one who makes notes of scarring and other issues and I failed the visual exam and told her multiple times of my poor vision, there's nothing else I can say to her at this point.",medicine,1537228357,Mufasa6821cc,2,1,True,2018-09-17

Would a non-compete law for insurance companies be effective?,"Out of curiosity, how beneficial would it be for both the public and physicians if a non competitive insurance law was passed? Let me explain,

So in the U.S. it is legal for insurance companies to negotiate prices with hospitals and medical facilities to receive a lower price for health related needs. Due to this, hospitals tend to mark up prices by much more than is affordable to the general public without insurance to be able to negotiate lower prices. This fantasy law would make it illegal for hospitals to charge less to insurance companies and everyone would need to pay the same rate, thus lowering overall costs so medical treatment would be more affordable for everyone and insurance companies would still be able to conduct business. This could mean the $130 iv bag that the hospital pays very little for may cost more in the range of $30-40.

Would this fantasy law be effective at increasing the ability for people to afford medical treatment while still having the same high quality medical care that we have in the u.s. from a medical perspective?",medicine,1537248748,GforGENIUS,9,10,True,2018-09-18

"Health/medical professionals of reddit, what can I do with a BS in pre clinical Health Sciences?","Hello everyone. I am post an undergrad degree where I obtained a BS in health sciences with honors. My original plan was to go to either medical school or PA school but by the time I reached my senior year I was feeling pretty burnt out and disenfranchised with the medical industry as a whole. 
As of right now, I have no idea what career opportunities I can/am able to pursue.
I don’t have the money or dedication for medical school or even PA school for that matter. 
I’ve had friends/family recommend that I go the technical school route (rad tech, RT tech, surg tech etc). I don’t think I would have a problem getting into those programs with my degree/GPA and I know there’s a decent amount of crossover with the classes. 

HOWEVER:
It just feels redundant because then I’d be in those 2 year programs with a degree already while some people are in there straight out of high school with no experience. And so their 2 years of tech school will earn them the same salary as my 6 years of undergrad and tech school. I know I’d have the advantage when it comes to job offers over those with just the 2 years, but it’s still a mind fuck that people with less than half as much schooling/knowledge/debt as me will be making the same pay, since we’d both come out with the same title/cert. 

I remember I went into a trade school to inquire about a surgical tech program and told the advisor I already had an undergrad degree and she was like “then what are you doing here??!” in a half joking way. Either way it discouraged the hell out of me. Made me feel like my degree was kinda worthless.

Also, I’m at the point where I feel like I need to be making money in the work force rather than continuing schooling and going into debt (was able to finish undergrad with no debt yay). And also how do you work/pay bills when you’re in school full time?? 

Any suggestions on a career path I can pursue that would pay decent (50k ish) but wouldn’t require too much more schooling/certs? Because right now I’m working as a scribe in an outpatient facility making $15/hr... with a degree -_-

Roche Announces Design of its 'Pivotal' Phase 3 Huntington's Disease Study,"Roche and Genentech [have confirmed](https://en.hdbuzz.net/263) the Phase 3, ""pivotal"" trial design in Huntington's disease for their antisense oligonucluotide against the huntingtin mRNA (both wild type and mutant) which will initiate later this year: site operationalization through end of 2018 and first-patient, first-visit in early 2019.  


[Study Design Slide](https://hdsa.org/news/roches-phase-3-trial-for-rg6042-formerly-ionis-htt-rx-has-been-announced-generation-hd1/generation-hd1/).  

Apart from being the largest RCT conducted in HD, the study will have a split primary endpoint analysis - the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) for the US and the cUHDRS for the rest of world.  Meaning when they run the primary analysis of all 660 patients for the US FDA, the TFC will be the top variable in the hierarchical statistical analysis.  Likewise for the cUHDRS to satisfy the EMA and other global regulatory agencies.  

I also think this is a good example for those of us in Pharma to point to when practicing clinicians ask us ""Why did you design or execute your trial that way?"".  And we answer ""*Because the @#%$# FDA and EMA said so*"".  

The FDA appeared to stand their ground and want the TFC as the primary endpoint.  The EMA appeared to shoot that down and wanted the cUHDRS.  So, if you don't somehow satisfy both agencies, you won't be able to get a drug approved in that respective region no matter what else you do.  This is one of the cold, hard realities of drug development.  you clinicians won't get new agents if we don't play nice with the FDA and EMA.  

All that aside, we are on the edge of a revolution in neurology.  RG6042 has shown some real promise in the Phase 1/2a study in lowering mutant huntingtin protein.  If successful, antisense oligionucleotides have the potential to go mainstream as they are made more and more stable.

Extreme Institution Bias Against Pharma,"I wanted to start a conversation on just how biased against Pharma Institutions  - including mine - are becoming.

* No co-authorship on Pharma-originating articles (I don't get that)

Now, they are requiring full and mandatory disclosure of any Pharma stock holdings (or other investments) for you and *any first-degree relatives*, and failure to disclose can result in the institution at the very least dismissing you, or if they decide it was serious enough in their minds, assume that the ""financial conflict of interest"" unduly influenced your prescribing on behaviors and thus constitute insurance or healthcare fraud.

"How long could a person live if they suddenly became severely allergic to the water molecule? Like not to impurities or other substances reacting with water, but an IgE mediated reaction to the water molecule itself.","People on Reddit seem to be very quick to defend the idea that being allergic to the water molecule is a real thing and when I asked them how they dealt with the extracellular water that is constantly bathing mastocytes (allergy cells) in the body, they just completely avoided that question, called me ignorant and other expletives and I got down-voted into oblivion. They cite old case files as their proof as well as a wikipedia article claiming it is proof that an allergy to the water molecule is real and people allergic to the water molecule would not have a constant allergic reaction.

But enough about that, I wanna hear it from a doctor's / another student's perspective. Tabloids allow anyone nowadays to get their 15 minutes of fame so the line between what's real and what's fake can be a little blurred. But if someone suddenly became allergic to the water molecule (anti-H2O IgE antibodies present), is it realistic or plausible that they'd be 100% healthy as long as they avoided drinking or touching water and could go on to live long happy lives? For example, if someone was allergic to peanuts and the water in their body was replaced with peanut butter would they only have a reaction if they ate peanut butter but not have a reaction to the peanut butter in their tissues?

"Most physicians burned out, overworked and 8 other survey findings","""U.S. physicians continue to struggle with burnout and job satisfaction, according to a survey from the national, nonprofit Physicians Foundation.

The survey of 8,774 physicians was conducted by the foundation, with help from Merritt Hawkins, from early April through early June.

Here are 10 findings:

1. Thirty-one percent of respondents said they identified as independent practice owners or partners. That's down from 33 percent in 2016 and 48.5 percent in 2012.

2. Nearly 16 percent of respondents said they work 61-70 hours per week, on average, on clinical and nonclinical duties, down from 16.5 percent in 2016. Additionally, 4.7 percent of respondents work 81 or more hours per week, on average, compared to 6 percent in 2016.

3. On average, 27.6 percent of respondents see 21-30 patients per day (including office and hospital encounters), down from 28.1 percent in 2016. Additionally, 8.6 percent of respondents see an average of 31-40 patients per day compared to 8.8 percent in 2016.

4. Most respondents (80 percent) said they are at full capacity or overextended and overworked.

5. Most respondents (61.6 percent) said they are very or somewhat pessimistic about the future of the medical profession. Only 38.4 percent said they are very or somewhat optimistic.

6. Sixty-nine percent of respondents reported prescribing fewer pain medications amid the nation's opioid crisis.

7. Seventy-eight percent of respondents said they sometimes, often or always feel burned out.

8. Respondents spend an average of 11.37 hours per week on nonclinical paperwork. That's an increase from 11.29 hours in 2016 and 10.58 hours in 2014.

9. Nearly half of respondents (46 percent) plan to change career paths, and 17 percent plan to retire in the next one to three years.

10. Respondents cited EHR design/interoperability as the top reason for professional dissatisfaction and physician-patient relationships as the top reason for professional satisfaction.""

"Hey /r/Medicine, if you're interested, I made an open source Research Paper recommender for MedLine papers, check it out. Easy to run in Google Colaboratory.","I made a research paper recommender MedLine papers, try it out! It uses embeddings to represent each paper, so you can get TSNE maps of the recommended papers, recommendations of a combo of several papers, and TSNE maps of the recommendations for that combo of several papers.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains over 2 million papers from MedLine. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations. 

https://i.imgur.com/B4qdoCC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg

###Where is it?

Github

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 2,096,359 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

Here's a quick video demonstration:

https://youtu.be/Y-O0wbsg_kY

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). 

https://i.imgur.com/0yAQEZl.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

In Section 4, insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change these lines 

    extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 #+ paper3 + paper4  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 
    extracted_vSM = paper1SM #+ paper2SM + paper3SM + paper4SM  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 
    
    paper1SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 5 to get a TSNE map of the recommendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in March 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 50 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 2,096,359 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit that I can use to tune the hyperparameters.

To the family of my patient -,"To the family of my patient who died today - I'm sorry what we had to give wasn't enough. I promise we gave 110% to your loved one. We didn't go through all this training just to have our knowledge and work be futile. It broke our hearts to be unable to fix what was irrevocably broken.

I know you accused us of giving up because your heart was breaking. I know this was probably one of the worst days of your life, and I promise to you, it was one of mine too. I know you wanted everything done, but doing everything broke our spirits bit by bit, knowing that what we were doing was causing pain and suffering. Sometimes everything is too much, and yet will never be enough. All I wanted to do after your loved one died was to hug and cry with you, to say I'm sorry.

But I didn't want you to think we didn't try; that somehow we needed to say I'm sorry for not doing something. So instead I cried while writing my notes and finishing up work I had been unable to do the rest of the day because I spent most of the day trying to keep your loved one alive.

So, instead I'll say it here: to the family of my patient who died today - I'm sorry, and know that I cried for your loved one too.

~~~~~~~

Excuse me for my poor intern sleep deprived stream of consciousness. 

It's starting to hit me that the roughest part is that you can't really walk away cause that means someone could die. 
In other jobs, when you're fed up, you can just say screw it, I'll get back to it when I feel more up to it. And in some other jobs, even if you don't, it'll eventually be okay cause at least it's not the end of the world for someone. Not the case for medicine. Knowing the buck stops at you can be overwhelming sometimes. I'm glad I'm still training and I have backup, but man, does it sometimes hit hard. And it's harder when you know maybe the best thing to do is to stop - that you've hit the limits of what medicine can provide - but you're still obligated to do so because we as a society haven't really come to terms with dying gracefully. And even rougher still is wanting to mourn the loss of a life with the family and your coworkers, but work pulls you in a thousand other different directions because you still have to make sure you give it your all for all the others you are responsible for.",medicine,1537830121,mangodroplet,39,434,True,2018-09-24

My one year guarantee is up and I’m currently in talks with employer about extending guarantee as the numbers have not picked up as they thought they would. Two providers were hired on at once and we have been struggling to keep numbers up. 

I received an email today saying that our office administrator and the VP of Physician Financial Services (whatever that is) want to “round” with me on Thursday for an hour. At first I was thinking ‘well, whatever’ but the more I think about it, the more I’m actually offended. 

I understand that they are trying to decide whether or not to make an investment in extending my guarantee but at the same time, are they questioning my judgement/patient interaction? I’m a board certified physician. What training does this BS vp have? From a patient confidentiality standpoint, do they have any reason to be in the room if they’re not part of the patient care team? 

I’m about ready to drop this job as these guys have been doing me dirty. What are your thoughts on the situation?",medicine,1537927110,DarthBroosevelt,83,203,True,2018-09-25

How do you discuss alternative practitioners like naturopaths with your patients without potentially alienating them?,"Pretty straightforward - I work in a rehab hospital that has dedicated space it rents out (previously it was a pharmacy, then a weight loss clinic).

Recently, a private therapy clinic was unveiled as the next tenant. We were actually excited because it could be a new outpatient clinic we could refer patients to for physio or occupational therapy. However, we found out it will also have a naturopath. I've already been asked by 1 or 2 patients about the clinic, and basically said ""Yo could go to the naturopath, but take it with a grain of salt and follow up the recommendations with your MD"".

Now, it's possible that this person will actually *try* to be evidence based and offer patients appropriate diet and lifestyle advice without BS like food sensitivities or adrenal fatigue, but I haven't heard good things.

So I'd like to know how you guys approach this topic and try to ""warn"" patients who are thinking of going to one? I've had to have conversations with patients about naturopaths before, but they were all in acute care and *after* they went to the clinic and got ""assessed"" or ""treated""

""We don't believe you need these 5 tests because _____""

Relationships in the working environment,"Hello everyone!

*I hope I am not violating rule 8., I will take the post down if I did and I am sorry.*

I am going to start in my new job at a new hospital the next week and I would like some advice from more experienced people in here when it comes to the interpersonal relationships in the work environment. I have had some trouble dealing with colleagues before, especially superiors. I know that if I want to have a great career I have to earn these guys respect and it would really benefit me if they were to genuinely like me as a person.

However, I am not the kind of person that walks into a bar and can connect with other persons who seems to instantly enjoy his company. I am genuinely polite and discreet and I don't rub people the wrong way but I am a closed person and find it hard to connect with people. For example, when me and a superior of mine finish with the procedure, I just stand there and don't have anything to talk about besides work and that awkward silence is killing me.

American Medical Association being Unreasonable," Hi all, first time posting here.

Anyway, so I was a member of the AMA few years back in medical school for the benefits (discounted books, etc, etc), when I started residency I didn't see a need for it so I been an inactive member for the past few years.

Fast forward to now. I'm applying for state license (different state then I'm currently a resident in) because I'll be done with residency next June. I get a email from the licensing board telling me that everything was good except that my AMA profile had an incorrect random state license (AMA had put it there by mistake). So my first thought was, ""huh AMA collected my information?"" But its whatever so I called them to tell them that it is incorrect and they agreed to remove it. However, they told me that it would cost 40 dollars to sent a official corrected report to that particular state board or 45 dollars for me to join AMA (which i can send unlimited copies).

I told them that was ridiculous, first off I didn't even know AMA to collected my information in the first place (its probably in the fine print somewhere when I had signed up in medical school). Second and more importantly\*\*, I don't understand why I would have to pay the cost for a mistake on the AMA's part, they kept telling me to join AMA for 45 dollars a month so I can send unlimited reports.\*\* I have already spoken with 2 customer and it seems like they are hellbent on getting me to pay 40 or 45 dollars. I really don't want to pay them out of principle. I already wasted a ton of time trying to reason with them. Its likely that I'll end up paying them just to get licensing process over with.

Ureaplasma - help,"For the past two months I’ve been suffering with a constant burning sensation in my vagina. I’ve been in and out of doctors. I was on holiday in America when it began, I went to planned parenthood and they found BV and a yeast infection which I took the antibiotics for. The pain persisted after I finished the antibiotics.

When I got back to the UK I went to a private obgyn who did a transvaginal scan to check my ovaries for any cysts. All was normal. She tested me for every STI and all results came back negative except for Ureaplasma. I took the suggested dosage of azithromycin (4 pills at once) but the pain still remained. My obgyn said to monitor the pain and see her in three months.

I wasn’t happy with this response as the pain felt as though it was getting worse so I went to a clinic and they examined me and treated me for PID with moxoflaxcin. I’ve completed the two week course and the pain is still here! They have now decided to put me on two weeks of doxycycline, two tablets a day.

Could this be the Ureaplasma still causing this pain? There isn’t much information on the internet but I saw where one person has said they needed to take a couple of course of antibiotics.

Any US attendings here?,"I’d post this in the career thread but seems like most people there are either earlier in their career or non US physicians.

I’m finishing my fellowship next June and am looking for jobs right now.

I’m trying to decide between being academic and going into private practice. 

An academic job near where I am would pay about $220k for about 40-50 hrs a week of mostly ICU sprinkled with a little pulm here and there. I would also be able to learn a lot from the more senior physicians there. This is sort of where I was leaning.

However, I just got a job offer yesterday - one that I applied to on a whim - for $400k base plus bonuses in a major metro area on the coast. The job description however, is this: I would be the first physician in a new group they are starting in an effort to convert their open ICUs to closed ICUs. This would start with one community hospital in their system and move on to 9 others. The opportunities for career growth as ICU director and beyond is obviously attractive.

However, it sounds like there would be a lot of administration involved.

My skills at this point are purely clinical and I am apprehensive about going into such a new environment with new responsibilities. I made this clear to them and yet they still say they want me because of my language proficiency that serves the particular ethnic community these hospitals are based in. One of my career goals is indeed to serve my own community but I’m afraid that if I go straight into private practice from fellowship, my growth as a clinician might be halted. Also, there are no in house services. What would happen if I was doing a perc trach and something goes wrong and I need ENT there to bail me out?

To my patient who died today -,"Today, I declared my first death. This young patient was one whom I held dear - I had seen them in the ED a few weeks ago, and inherited them when I got to the MICU.

To my patient who died today - I know you didn’t want to come into the hospital and you wanted to be able to go home if you could. I had hoped we could fix you up a bit so you could peacefully spend as much time as you could with your young spouse and kids. But we just couldn’t fix you enough - you were too sick.

Here you were, in the ICU when I got there, weeks after I had first met you. Each day was a battle of trying to titrate drips, interpreting new scans, trying to fix the vent settings, postulating what new test or procedure to do to maybe help you get better. Yet, nothing helped. We had some “good” days, where you’d get to be more awake, but there were so many more bad days than the good.

At the end of the day, I don’t think what we did medically really helped much at all. It ultimately just prolonged your suffering.

Honestly, I think the most healing I got to do was to know more about you, your life, your accomplishments, your dreams. Getting to celebrate you with your spouse was the most healing that was happening in that room.

Thank you for healing me. Thank you for trying to know more about me as well. It’s incredible that even while you were intubated, while you were in pain, you made the effort to write to ask about me. Thank you for lighting up when I told you I was a foodie and that I’d love to try your food one day. Thank you for blessing me with your friendship. Thank you for forgiving me for convincing you to come into the hospital.

To my patient who died today - You fought a good fight, and lived more life than many could ever hope for. I hope you have peace, and may we all meet one day again.",medicine,1538192159,mangodroplet,35,970,True,2018-09-28

Long term maintenance therapy vs discontinuation in patients with schizophrenia.,"Cross-post from /r/psychiatry 
Dear all,

I was wondering what your opinions were on the long-term use of antipsychotic medications in psychosis.

I have found a number of trials and papers, many with different outcomes. Some (1) suggested that discontinuation regimes are better (or not worse) than maintenance therapy for both relapse rates and functioning at seven years.

On the other hand, large observational studies like this (2) seem to show a benefit in terms of hospitalisation and death.

There seems to be an immense amount of literature surrounding this topic.I'm interested to hear your opinions and was also wondering if anyone knows of any good reviews which synthesise all the evidence?

Why can't I find any medical literature on the H20 molecule being an allergen?,"Woman with an allergy to the H20 molecule who cannot even drink water without her throat swelling shut and reacts to her own tears is writing a ''long awaited'' book about her allergy called ''It's Only Water''

https://socialnewsdaily.com/75296/woman-possesses-fatal-water-allergy/

Here's an earlier article on her from when she was 8 https://www.thefreelibrary.com/JUST+ONE+CUP+OF+WATER+COULD+KILL+LITTLE+HEIDI%3B+Girl%27s+deadly+allergy...-a061152595

She not only reacts to her own sweat and tears but she also has an extreme internal reaction to water when she drinks it, such as her throat closing up. There are news articles on her since she was eight years old, such as the second article I provided.

Here is a very recent separate case which is nearly identical and it made the headlines https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6185043/Teenager-19-allergic-TEARS-breaks-hives-touches-water.html

She also cannot drink water, because when she does, it causes ''agonizing sores'' in her mouth, so she only drinks milk. Her own tears cause her to break out in hives because her immune system sees the H20 molecule as foreign.

Given that I've seen like 50 articles about this in a year, why can't I find any medical literature on anti-water IgE, etc? Especially considering that an allergy to the water molecule goes against everything we currently know about immunology and biology in general?

What happened to Guy Fawkes?,"(Sorry, moderators. There was no flair for layperson, so I didn't select any).

I was in London recently and visited the tourist attraction ""The Dungeons of London"" where you walk through a maze and see some of the darker aspects of London's past. One station was the famed Gun Powder Plot. In 1605 a group of Catholics were going to assassinate king James I by blowing up a huge pile of gun powder under the Parliament building. A person called Guy Fawkes was guarding the gun powder, but he was found and arrested by the king's soldiers.

At first he gave a false name and refused to rat out his companions, but the king authorised the use of torture, and after a few days he succumbed and gave the names of his accomplices. [It's actually a very fascinating story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot)!

What kind of torture he was subjected to isn't know for sure, but it is widely believed that they used a [stretching rack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_(torture\)) on him. He was likely tied with ropes on his wrists and ankles and he was stretched until his arms and legs were dislocated and the ligaments(?) torn apart.

Here is a photo of Guy Fawkes' normal signature and the one he gave on his confession shortly after the torture. It shows the weak scrawls of a broken man! Pretty disturbing...

Any US trained physicians who are now working in Canada? Questions on the process...,"I'm a PGY2 Pediatrics resident in an ACGME residency program. I'm looking into my options for moving to Canada after residency to close a long-distance relationship. I'm an American citizen, but could potentially be sponsored for Canadian PR.

I know peds residency is 1 year shorter in the US (much like many residency programs), which makes licensing and eventual practice in Canada tricky.

It seems that these are the options available:

1. Pathway 3 in Ontario- work under supervision for a 12-18 month period after becoming board certified in US, do not need to take Royal College Exam- however not sure if not having the ""RCPSC"" designation would be a career barrier
2. Do fellowship in the US, or Canada (if I'm able to get visa sponsorship or obtain PR status) which would make up for length of training difference and allow me to then write the Royal College exam
3. Apply for a ""Repatriation Program"" and try and get a PGY4 spot at a Canadian peds residency program (seems unlikely that there would be spots?). This seems to include a return of service agreement attached to it, and would require Canadian PR. I would then be eligible to write the Royal College exam.

I have not completed LMCC exams and don't know if that is needed for any of these options... I've done all Step exams.

How do you deal with unrelenting angry patients?,"Today on rounds a patient was putting on quite a show. Ended up berating the medical students, residents, and attending. Prior to entering the room they were yelling at the nurses and food services staff. Over the last 4-5 days it seems anyone who needs to go in to the patient's room dreads it. They end up leaving the room defeated and angry. 

Now all of us in the room just kind of nodded our heads and tried to assuage their concerns. Obviously that didn't work too well and the encounter ended with them telling us if it wasn't fixed they were leaving AMA. Sitting here now I wish I would have said something. However, I'm sure that would have resulted in some form of reprimanding or a negative patient satisfaction survey.

Informed Consent and Lab Validation,"I just attended a multi-disciplinary meeting revolving around a lab process for validating their testing machines.

At our institution, every machine is validated every 6 months. The process is that for each machine, some number (30-50) of appropriate patient samples are collected, completely at random, and then run through the machine. According to our lab management, it is required that samples of similar bio-protein matrix whatever samples are run for validation, and fresh patient samples are one of the suggested substrates for testing. Also according to our management, this is a national standard of practice.

I have major reservations about this, with regards to patient consent. At our institution, the patients sign that they agree to this when they sign their general consent for treatment. However, my argument is that despite the fact that they agree to it, I don't believe it is possible for them to give informed consent. 

Informed consent requires that the patient be informed. When the patient signs their general consent for treatment, it is impossible for any clinical staff (administrative, nurses, assistants, physicians, etc.) to know if, when or what validation tests will be performed on patient samples, and therefore it is impossible for them to inform the patients of the potential benefits and harms. This came up at our institution because a D-dimer was critically elevated, but this could occur for tumor markers, genetic tests, or really anything, and have significant and serious downstream effects that can't be predicted.

"With all the recent loan talk, I just wanted to highlight the Primary Care Loan which helped me pay off 240k in 2.5 yrs after residency","For those of you going to medical schools in the US that graduate a high percentage of primary care doctors, there may be a special loan program available from the government, called the Primary Care Loan. The loan has a lot of perks that helped me pay off 240k in 2 1/2 yrs after residency.  

If your school is on the list, the loan is available to you.
https://ersrs.hrsa.gov/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/HGDW_Reports/EHB_BHPR_LOAN_PROG/PCL_Loan_Program_List&amp;rs:Format=HTML4.0

Perks: 
1) No interest in medical school and residency.

2) No payments required in medical school and residency. If you do pay, it goes towards principal as there is no interest until after residency.

3) Simple interest compounded annually after residency.

4) No location requirement. You can practice anywhere as long as it is primary care.

Caveats:
1) Yearly certifications that you are in primary care.
2) No take backsies. Once you sign, if you specialize, there is a high interest penalty for specializing. 
3) No perks of government loans like forebearance (although you probably won't need it with no payment requirements in residency).
4) If you decide on primary care later on in med school, they won't pay for interest in your previous years before you decided. 

With this loan, I was able to pay off my 240k loan by doing the following:
1) Saved all the money I would have paid in residency in an index fund during a bull market.
2) After residency, dumped that money (after taxes) into the loan (80k).
3) Signed up for a job that had a bonus for primary care doctors (80k).
4) Paid half my monthly paycheck to loans.

With all this news about free tuition, I wanted to highlight a way that  might be available to more people. With this loan it is very possible to live comfortably in residency and after and still pay off your loans quickly. Don't let loan burden be the determining factor if this loan is available to you.

CTPE vs CTPA?,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an MS4 slightly confused about CT nomenclature for Pulmonary Embolism studies. I had a patient with intermediate Wells and + D-dimer. The resident I was working with ordered ""CT Thorax w/Contrast (CT PE)"". I read on uptodate that preferred study is CTPA (aka CT pulmonary angiogram). ACR appropriateness criteria rates CTPA and CT chest with IV contrast optimized for pulmonary circulation (which I assume  = CTPE?) as equally appropriate for dx of PE. This is a patient from a month ago, so I can't really ask the resident I worked with, but can you guys help shed light on the topic? Essentially:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Am I correct to understand CT Thorax w/Contrast (CT PE) = CT chest with IV contrast optimized for pulmonary circulation (as stated by ACR)?

2) Am I correct to understand that CT PE is not the same thing as CT PA? (I did see an order in the computer for ""CT Angio Pulmonary"", which I assume is CTPA).

A randomized controlled trial of workplace wellness interventions has shown no 'significant causal effects of treatment' on multiple health-related and cost effectiveness outcomes,"PDF Link: http://www.nber.org/papers/w24229.pdf

An article from the National Bureau of Economic Research performed a randomized controlled trial of a 'comprehensive workplace wellness program', with the authors stating that they did 'not find significant causal effects of treatment on total medical expenditures, health behaviors, employee productivity, or self-reported health status in the first year'.

This article is the first randomized controlled trial on this subject, according to [this source](https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/first-randomised-controlled-trial-employee-%E2%80%9Cwellness-programme%E2%80%9D-suggests-they-are). I figured this would be interesting to the people of meddit, not just because of the relevance to psychology, but also because medical schools and hospitals routinely employ 'resilience' and 'wellness workshops' in their programs.

Is this study sufficiently powerful to set the foundation for a meaningful policy change? Will this prompt administrators to stop their wellness seminars? My cynicism says 'no', but what do you guys think?",medicine,1535076911,DinoBooster,0,1,True,2018-08-23

But with these specific cases, I've documented 500+ word explanations of how I went to great lengths to explain why the patient needed what they needed, what could happen, the risks of their decisions, how the patient verbalized their understanding, how they repeated back to me what I was telling them, etc. Basically I try to cover all the accusations I think a lawyer would throw at me.

"Today, I finally felt like I did some good for the first time.","Hi! I am currently a PGY1 in OBGYN. Excuse this post, but i feel like i need to share this quick story and brag on myself just a little bit. Long story short, I’ve been liking residency so far and I’m certain I went into the right field. However since starting, I’ve always felt like I was just “fitting in.” I was able to take care of floor patients, right orders, give prescriptions, deliver babies, and do c-sections. I know that I was able to help patients, but it almost felt routine.

Today though, i was in our eval (kind of like a women’s ED). As the intern, I was the first to see everyone and come up with a plan before going over it with my upper levels. A woman came in with mild cramping at 30 WGA. She had good baby movement, no vaginal bleeding, no loss of fluid. I thought it was a routine maternal discomfort complaint but as soon as i saw her strip, I knew something was up. She had been on the monitor for a few minutes, but I think i saw some prolonged decels and mild, short interval contractions. I told my chief, but we weren’t sure as we didn’t have a good baseline yet. He just told me to keep an eye on it.

So anyways I kept routinely triaging folks. 15 minutes later, she started gushing blood and felt severe abdominal pain. She had abrupted and had a stat C. This was the first time I had seen an abruption.  It’s true what they say: you’ll never forget the presentation once you see an abruption. Luckily she did ok but the chief and attending told me that normally, they’d wait a few minutes to see a “maternal discomfort” patient as they generally aren’t as severe as laboring or bleeding patients. However since I noticed the decels and the contractions, we were able to atleast make the OR aware of a possible stat. It was a great compliment to hear the chief and attending say “good job, you helped save her and her baby.”

Dear physicians of medicine in hospital...,"Hello all— I am a nurse at a top 100 cardiac hospital, and board certified in cardiology. Therefore I am allowed to supervise procedures as long as the cardiologist is in the hospital (we are a 600 bed hospital). I have worked in my area 15 years, I’m 35- (unfortunately look 25). I gained my position based on 15 years of experience with tough cardiologists. So I supervise an array of cardiac stress tests and trials for AS. 
Point being— a simple request. New residents are sent to spend time with me to understand ischemic testing, and aortic stenosis work up for TAVR. I love my job and am very passionate about it and extremely proud of the respect I have gained from cardiology and the trust.

A simple request... I’ve had an increase amount of seemingly arrogant medical students who scoff at being ‘paired with a nurse’ 

We are on the front lines. 
We are educated. We earned our positions. 
We are your friends as we can give you warning and know before anyone what is impending. 

Cheers to us all, and let’s work together— please. ",medicine,1535571626,jamiegirl21,9,0,True,2018-08-29
Why do so many surgeons think that ‘men don’t care about scars’...?,"This does not include all surgeons by any means but I have worked in several countries and I’ve come across this attitude quite often.

Laparascopic surgery is avoided in male hernias or appendix surgery because “he’s a guy, he won’t care if he has a scar but a woman cares if she can’t wear her bikini”. I’ve also seen surgeons perform delicate subcut wound closures for women and then use nylon interrupted or staples for men getting the same procedure because “he won’t care”. 

As an anesthesiologist (and a man), I wouldn’t say I find this opinion offensive, but it’s a little backwards for sure.",medicine,1535572607,wefeelyourpresence,83,136,True,2018-08-29

Adult breast size and childhood sexual abuse,"I have a psychotherapy client who ruminates on whether it's possible that being sexually abused from the ages of two to eight contributed to early and extreme breast growth. When someone is ruminating on a question that has an answer, I generally suggest they find out the answer as a first step. She doesn't have the literacy skills to find the answer on her own, so I did some searching, but haven't been successful so far. I've found some information about childhood sexual abuse causing earlier puberty, but I don't know if that's related to adult breast size. If there's any source that explains whether or not childhood sexual abuse can influence adult breast size in simple language, that would be ideal.

How to tell patients you’re leaving the practice?,"I’m in my third year at a residency where a significant portion of us have our continuity clinic at the VA. 

I’ve noticed a recurring theme of veterans being anywhere from annoyed to frustrated to outright angry that their PCP is graduating/moving away (sometimes insisting on blaming the VA/funding/the government). In a lot of ways I get this; we deal with a lot of sensitive topics and psychosocial barriers, plus telling a life story in a “new PCP” appointment repetitively has to be annoying. 

Our attendings don’t often see the resident patients face-to-face beyond the first half of our intern year unless there’s something strange or serious, which means most patients don’t know their more consistent supervising attending, and the resident role as gatekeeper to VA services (and thus the face of the VA) I’m sure both contribute.

Vitriol is unfounded-,"So. I’ll say this. I’ve seen some vitriol on Reddit and Facebook regarding NPs. Not all NPs, PAs, MDs, DOs are created equal. My NP program required 2000+ hours of clinical time on top of my RN experience to make me who I am. And many PA programs are similar. There’s a lot of hate to online programs. I don’t think any NPs I know want to “take over” an MD’s spot. In our very specialized case, we are here to 1) create continuity for our MDs and 2) ensure our interns get OR time. Also 3) education for our residents because we have “seen this” a few times- and even if our NP program didn’t give us the hours, our nursing experience did. It’s not about one-upping anyone. So. I am an avid follower of Reddit’s r/meddit aka r/medicine and I love the dialogue there. I’m a huge advocate of NPs having autonomy, but I also recognize that not all NPs are created equal (nor are MDs nor DOs). I’m UCSF trained for comparison.

Doctors of Reddit in a Clinic Setting: In Need of Some Practical Advice on Being More Efficient with My Time and Setting Limits with Families,"I am a pediatrician in my 3rd year of practice, now 2nd job out of residency (moved to my hometown with my husband in effort to decrease stress in our lives) and I am struggling to find ways to be more efficient in my office visits but strike the balance of being compassionate with my families as I am building up my practice again. My question to doctors of reddit: what practical things do you do in your day of seeing patients to help minimize the work you do at the end of the day (how far you run behind, how many charts you have left to finish, phone calls, etc) but still maintain a loyal patient population?

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background**: I work at a larger organization, salary is based on production, I have been at this position for just nine months now and under a salary guarantee for the first year (was at my last position exactly one year).  I work 4.5 days a week (full FTE is 37 patient face-to-face hours which is what that is). I just switched my schedule from all 30 minute appointments to 20 minute appointments with 40 minutes for mental health consults (one at the end of my morning, one at the end of my day) and 40 minutes for my well teenager visits. This was in efforts to increase my production. My organization uses Epic as our EHR and just made this transition this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Areas where I struggle:** 

1) Part of what I try to do is listen to my families and help them feel heard, which is a common complaint I hear from them about their prior experiences with other providers. Unfortunately I have a tough time cutting them off and this leads to me running behind and feeling frantic the rest of the day. How do you set limits with families when they want to talk about other medical problems in a problem-focused or well visit that is not what the appointment is schedule for?

2) How do you chart throughout your day to decrease the work you do at the end of your day? What things have you ""let go of"" in terms of detail in your charting? 

3) Where do you set limits in your schedule and how does your staff support you to make the day run smoother?

4) How do you handle late patients and no-shows?

5) If you could start fresh with the way you practice, what would you do differently?",medicine,1535995251,Coffee_and_Eggies,29,109,True,2018-09-03
"Gender pay gap - a follow up to the comment that ""if women want to be paid more, they should work harder""","[Dr. Gary Tigges - ""I now understand more clearly how intricate this issue is and that there are ways we can work together to resolve these disparities.""](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-gary-tigges-apology-pay-gap-female-physicians-do-not-work-as-hard/)

Equal treatment in an unequal system can still foster inequality (paraphrased, Matthew Desmond, author of Evicted).  I've offered some examples from my own specialty [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/9c2ihl/if_women_want_to_be_paid_more_they_should_work/e57w2rr/).  I'm glad that Dr. Tigges made his comments publicly, because it is evident that many of my colleagues hold the same opinions quietly, in a manner that can not be openly addressed.  

To those who continue to believe that the gender pay gap is solely due to female physicians not ""working as hard"" as male physicians, I would encourage you to ask your female colleagues about their experience.  Even if the women admit to working fewer hours, you may get to understand more clearly the systemic disparities that encourage them to make that choice.  

I've always said that if the residency system had been invented in a time where all medical trainees were female instead of male, my 6-year residency would be between ages 36-42 (instead of 25-31), to allow for the prime child-bearing years and infant childcare (when it is difficult to split, for example, breast-feeding 50/50).  Women would then be able to focus on career when the children are mostly independent, and their male partners can contribute more to domestic life.  Female life expectancy is longer on average as well, so overall career lifespan may be the same.  It's just one of a myriad of examples of an unequal system, and therefore, a simplistic explanation of the gender pay gap is not only deeply wrong, but also unhelpful in addressing the disparities.",medicine,1535998177,Urojet,1,1,True,2018-09-03

"My brother 24, has had very high fever since ATT started 15 days ago","Hi pulmonologists of Reddit, as the title says my brother 24 has had very high fever after about a week of starting ATT (started ATT 20 days ago). The fever goes up to 103-104 and he needs to take paracetamol (not sure exactly but some anti-pyretic) every 6 hours. He has been tested for Typhoid, Malaria, Dengue etc. but all tests for common infections came negative. The fluids in his chest has also increased to almost 2 times the level compared to 20 days ago when he started ATT. I am uploading the screenshot of his chest x-ray showing the fluids in almost half of his right lung. His chest has started hurting since last week. He is coughing a lot too. Doctors can't seem to be able to figure out why is he not responding to ATT and why is he getting worse instead of getting better.  


If it helps, 8 months ago he also got really sick with consistent high fever which wouldn't go away and after multiple tests he was diagnosed with a lactospyra infection (sorry if I botched the spelling). He was treated with Doxycyclene and responded well and got better.  


Any ideas on what can we do (additional investigations?) to figure out what's wrong? My parents are really worried and so am I.

A Rebuttal to Mike Ginsberg’s firing of Anti Vaxxers from his clinic.,"I think this approach is just going to get more ire and not help our present problem. It’s like me as a pulmonologist saying I’ll fire all the smokers in my practice. I’d rather have them there so I can convince them otherwise. The odds of me getting to their brains will increase as they come to trust and know me better. If this guy fires a parent and reports them to CPS - then we just lost all our chance in vaccinating the poor kids. Delayed vaccination(at the very least) is better than no vaccination.

I think anti vaxxers need to be educated. Not fire them or report them. They are misinformed. They trust google more than they trust us physicians - so earn their respect and turn them around. And no, giving them flyers on a 15 minute appointment does not count as education.

I can’t blame the guy because his concerns are legitimate and they truly can infect other healthy children in the office waiting room. 

However, I’d rather that he not posted this viral facebook comment because this really does not convince any anti vaxxers to get their kids vaccinated.

STE/STD physiology,"I read the following post, but still don't have my mind wrapped around the physiology:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/tovub/what\_is\_the\_physiology\_behind\_st\_elevation\_and\_st/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/tovub/what_is_the_physiology_behind_st_elevation_and_st/)

If the ST segment remains unchanged because it is depolarized to a electrical potential of zero then shouldn't the PR segment do the same and maintain an equivalent baseline relative to the ST segment? That is, if truly only the TP segment changes due to the ischemia then shouldn't the ST and PR segments change uniformally?

Also, if the direction of deflection of the ST segment changing relative to the TP segment is secondary to the more positive (less negative) electrical potential attained during ventricular repolarization (TP segment) then how do we get STE and STD from the same physiology? Seems to me like that would imply at some point repolarization causes a more negative electrical potential than the baseline pre-depolarized state. (This question refers only to STD that is due to subendocardial ischemia on the side of the infarction , not as reciprocal to STE on the opposite side).

Let's take the full STEMI, transmural ischemia scenario where supposedly the TP segment depresses on the EKG (causing relative elevation of the ST segment) because of poor repolarization (lack of ATP) and elevated electrochemical gradient (or less negative, near 0), and so the electrical pathway in repolarization is more concentrated away from the infarcted tissue leads. Why would blood flow to the epicardium only (and not endocardium) cause ST depression (i.e. TP elevation)? Seems to me it should be continuous movement in a single direction (e.g. endocardial ischemia would be half the STE as transmural ischemia rather than STD). That is, why would partial wall thickness with normal repolarization cause baseline TP elevation (relative ST depression)?

It appears that these companies are actually somehow forcing pharmacies to sell drugs below wholesale and then charge a service fee to the pharmacy.  If that's actually true, how is that legal?  Why can't pharmacists decline to honor the cards?

"What exactly does the ""higher standard"" we are held to entail?","Who officially coined this term? Is there any literature -- particularly a mission statement or manifesto-type document of an official governing body -- where the terms of this ""higher standard"" that physicians are held to are concretely spelled out, with examples? I'm sure there are plenty of opinion or editorial pieces by respected physicians in respected medical publications over the years that preach about this concept. But is there anything approaching *law* about exactly what it entails?

As anyone who knows me either on Reddit or IRL would suspect, I am very much a freethinker when it comes to the world of medicine, and as such approach the notion of a ""higher standard"" with a healthy skepticism. If this higher standard involves being unusually compassionate, I'm all for it. But I've seen this phrase trotted out to justify (IMHO) unjustifiable levels of corporate compliance, obedience to the hierarchy, overwork, workplace abuse, and tolerance of treatment and conditions no human being should be suspected to. In short, I think abuse of this nebulous cultural artifact of ""we're held to a higher standard"" is directly responsible for the immense rate of burnout and physicians leaving the profession. As I said, the only higher standard I care to be held to is one of great compassion. Other than that, I want to be treated, and expected to act, like a regular guy, and I think there is nothing unreasonable about this.",medicine,1532266398,hononononoh,101,145,True,2018-07-22

Will there ever be something that can reverse muscle scar tissue/fibrosis?,"Developing a treatment for muscular fibrosis/scar tissue will be a big step in the field of regenerative medicine. As I am sure, there are many people like me, who are suffering from this irreversible condition after a traumatic injury or muscular disease, would love there to be a treatment that can regenerate and turn muscle back into its functional state.

I have been doing alot of research on the topic and it seems there is still alot of experimentation in this area and many potential treatments are undergoing clinical trials. 

People suffering from heart-attacks are predisposed to further heart attacks in the future due to scar tissue that has formed in the muscle. There is a gene-therapy treatment where scientists were able to instruct the fibroblast cells in the scar tissue to behave and take on myocardial characteristics. 

My question is, why has this “effective approach” not been developed for skeletal muscle?

Help explaining a gap in training on the medical board website.,"I have a gap in training of around 2 years between two residencies. When I applied for my license, I had to report all work and academic history since high school, but the board secretary essentially transcribed my explanation for time off from my application to the board website which can be seen by the public. 

I'm wondering the most succinct explanation and the best way to ask the board to change the information on the website.

I took time off bc I got depressed, didn't like internal medicine residency, and because I didn't know what I wanted to do. In hindsight, it wasn't a good decision. Regardless, I was out for approximately 2 1/2 academic years. From October-June I was on 6 months unpaid FMLA leave then I officially resigned the following month and was out for another two years. During that time I didn't have a medical license so I worked in restaurants and did construction and landscaping work.

The board website says basically that. 

I'd like to have that time period left off of the website completely but when I asked the board secretary she said that there had to be something there. I think if Im lucky and spoke with someone who better understood the situation, I may be able to have that time left off the website completely. 

If not, any suggestions on how to better describe the time off? ",medicine,1532356776,-SoIDontGetFined,2,9,True,2018-07-23

Hats... er... hospital gowns off to the company who kept US hospitals outfitted with coin-op CRT TVs well into the 2010s!,"I posted this originally as a reply to the thread in r/TIL about companies that work to perpetuate the problem they sell a solution to. But it got buried and was, after all, a bit tangential to that discussion. My curiosity has not been satisfied: who *is* this company? How did they get away with their abomination of a service for so long? Do they still exist and ply their shtik in backwater hospitals? I figured someone in r/medicine has worked in enough hospitals long enough to know something about this phenomenon:

Many American hospitals I've worked at, up until relatively recently, had CRT televisions padlocked to some lunky looking swivel arm, with either a coin box or a key-operated power switch. Each and every morning, each inpatient would be greeted by a surly employee, often only slightly healthier than him/her, of this private company which owned and operated these televisions. The employee would either empty the coin box or collect a relatively exorbitant amount of money for one day's worth of a selection of ~13 channels -- cash only either way -- and then lumber up onto a rickety hospital chair and turn the TV on with their key. Or off if it was already on and you either didn't have the money or didn't want to pay it. It must have taken some serious business acumen, plus or minus a great asshole lawyer, a strong union, or some other kind of major ""in"", to wrangle these hospital administrators into multi-decade binding contracts with the provider of a technology -- particularly one for nothing but entertainment -- long after the technology's obsolescence and failure as a viable pay-per-use business plan.

Keep getting called a poor communicator by work supervisors without them specifying what is actually the issue,"I am a medical practitioner that works in Australia. I was not born here, born in Asia and of Eurasian descent. I work in the public system and am in the process emergency training. I am a senior trainee and often supervise the whole emergency department on night shifts. In certain circumstances, I am the most senior doctor on site. Part of training is that supervisors have to 'score' me on communication and teamwork.

Here is my issue. It is almost an recurrent issue that I am being scored lower that I expect on those two domains, especially communication. This is despite having being mentioned favourably in communiques (which I am usually not aware of) of events that require good communication and teamwork and receiving nice letters (and being named) from the occasional patient. Reasons range from the vague to ""so and so didn't like the tone of your voice"" to the contradictory (i.e. being graded as ""well regarded"" in the 1st 3 months, to being graded as ""abrupt and poor communicator""). Solutions given by supervisors usually range from ""go have an epiphany"", to, on the extreme end, ""see a psychologist"". The person who advised me to see a psychologist only worked with me 5 shifts over 6 months. Grading is meant to be 'multi-source'. Things became so bad that I had to write an almost 30 page letter with supporting documentation from independent observers, scientific literature, as well as my own medical records (I will get to this later) to challenge a ruling by my training college based on my apparent poor communication skills.

I was successful in my appeal but boy was that a traumatising experience.

Other things that I have experienced include being given a very specific set of shifts that others do not get, which only changed when I went above my supervisors and spoke to the director.

I have a congenital issue that leaves me with a pretty noticeable squint. Not only do I have a squint, I also tilted my head 40 degrees to one side to allow binocular vision. I only had it surgically managed about 2 years ago. I still have a squint but I tilt my head about 10 degrees now. There is a wealth of scientific research that shows people with my condition have the rough end of the stick when it comes to perception by others. Anecdotally, the fact that all my successful job interviews were over the phone supports this view.

My overall view of the situation is that I am completely lost in trying to fix the situation. I have wondered if I should change my workplace as it has a bad reputation in the eyes of trainees. A part of me tells me that I am being gaslighted, deliberately or not. I feel discriminated against in that preferential treatment is given to trainees who have been in the hospital for longer. I do still have to entertain if there is something 'wrong' with me but I do not know where to start. Part of this fear is mandatory reporting rules in the country in the event that someone finds a 'mental health issue', where being reported can end my career. Then there is my squint. I don't know what more I can do about this. I have to look in a mirror every now and then to avoid turning my head to its old position out of habit.

Any advice would be helpful.

tldr: People tell me that I am a poor communicator and team player but do not actually help me with trying to fix it. I also feel discriminated and gaslighted. I have a medical condition that potentially makes people discriminate against me. Need help to try and fix this, as I cannot get it from work.",medicine,1532444170,Piratartz,19,37,True,2018-07-24

Why can't I find this case about a girl allergic to water in any medical literature?

My sister is 25 yrs old and obese. Five years ago at 20 years old she presented symptoms of severe abdominal pain and inability to eat or drink and after numerous months and ER visits, she was diagnosed with Iliitis and then Crohn's disease.

Appox 1 yr later, she presented with the same symptoms, but did not show a Crohns flare up. She was diagnosed with C diff and was given Vancomycin. This happened again a year later and she had a fecal transplant and did not have c diff again.

1 1/2-2 yrs ago, she presented with the same symptoms again, (severe abdominal pain, inability to eat or drink) and she had catscans, sonograms, bloodwork, urine/stool cultures and everything was negative.. she had a colonoscopy/endoscopy with biopsy and it was negative.. she was hospitalized for pain and dehydration and eventually it mysteriously went away.

Friday July 6, she was taken to ER.. she had been having diarrhea and stomach pain for a few days and severe vaginal hemorrhaging.. (she has irregular periods and had not had her period for 6 months and got it so heavy she went through two overnight pads and a set of clothing each hour or two for 2 days.) she was released and returned to ER next two nights.. the bleeding subsided but the abdominal pain increased plus she had devere dehydration, dizziness shortness of breath, chest pain, flushed face but cold sweats.. she was admitted through ER on Monday morning and discharged on Tuesday night.. she was home Tues/wed/Thursday nights (saw gastro wed and gave stool samples Thursday) but was in severe abdominal pain, no food or drink (1 spoon rice and four ounces liquid (in total) since last Thursday night (a week prior) chest pain dizziness cold sweats and she almost fainted in shower.. back to ER on Friday night and admitted to hospital Saturday morning.. she had 2 catscans in ER, one gallbladder ultrasound, bloodwork and all negative. Given Morphine and IV fluids and got a positive cdiff result on Tuesday from sample taken last Thursday.. Dr was not confident she has active cdiff (possible colonization or carrier from previous c diff) but gave Vancomycin in case. Vancomycin not helping and she has 7/10 pain level at all times and 10/10 after Dr pushes on abdomen or after swallowing Vanco or water. Mention was made of Sphincter of Oddi but Dr says no high level of bile etc and he says to test for that is high risk of pancreatitis and is only done in two centers in the US so tomorrow colonoscopy/endoscopy with biopsy again to rule out anything else and if all negative; no answers., if she goes home, to see if time will heal her, she cannot tolerate anything by mouth so she will dehydrate again..

She has had an endoscopy/colonoscopy, MR enterography, transvaginal/pelvic sonogram and all is negative. Pain has increased or at the very least tolerance to pain has decreased. Psych team do not see psycho sematic connection. Doctors at hospital have no answers and increased her meds to Dilauded to try to get her to eat and drink so that they can discharge her to go home and see specialists but she is unable to take anything by mouth because anything by mouth causes her unbearable pain.. Her level of pain on pain meds is 7 at the best and after swallowing Vancomycin it is 12 and eventually goes back to 10... her entire body is in pain with twitching legs and sternum pain etc and she is just laying there in pain with no solution but if she is discharged she cannot eat or drink and her kidneys already show dehydration on fluids and her potassium is low.. we don't know what to do

Are many doctors afraid of patient contact? Do they feel uncomfortable or bored talking to patients? Are they lazy or overworked?,"I am not a medical professional, but because of long illnesses of myself and several close relatives that have included long periods of hospitalisation, I have received a lot of impressions of the way health care institutions are run. 

Something that I have noticed is how rarely patients and their relatives see and communicate with their doctor(s). From my experience, the nurse does many of the tasks that traditionally have been associated with the job of the doc. The nurse asks about the nature of symptoms, progression of symptoms, checks blood pressure, listens to heart and lungs, palpates the patient, does blood tests and review their results, etc. I have also experienced diagnoses being communicated by a nurse (""doctor says findings x indicate disease y""), and the nurse then talking the patient through medication, prognosis and other management of the disease, with the patient specifically having to ask to see the doctor if (s)he wanted that. 

The worst experience I had was at a cardiologist's office, where I did an exercise ECG and cardiac echo. The ECG was  done with only the nurse in the room, while the echo was done by a nurse handling the machine, while the doctor was sitting at the other end of the room, behind a computer apparently giving the same images as the machine, occasionally telling the nurse to get one more view of images etc. Then the doctor reviewed the ECG and echo images by himself for 10-15 minutes, and I then talked to the doctor for the only time for 30 seconds upon leaving, when he told me that the tests looked all fine. 

Are doctors really that overworked that many find it necessary to delegate so many tasks to nurses (who by the way are highly competent and I feel perfectly safe when treated by)?

Reported to the Medical Board in retaliation; the story of my last year.,"Hey all. I guess I’d first like to open up by saying I’m free. The medical board threw out all charges against me earlier this week and I can finally breathe again. I want to tell you all how I got here, though, and it was probably the worst ride of my life.  



For the past 12 months, I have been dealing with false charges leveled against me by a retaliatory administrator who chose to report me for being a drug addict when I quit.  The issue is that I am not, nor have ever been, a drug addict. I want you all to know how easy it is to find yourself in this nightmare given the right circumstances. It is the closest to hell I think I’ll ever have been in. Please note that if we decide to file suit against my accusers I’ll have to delete this, but per my lawyer there is nothing wrong with posting this in forum at this juncture. 



I worked a small community hospital in the southeast after finishing my residency in the PNW.  I never had been to the south, and I took an offer there due to my family needing the money.  I saw it as a 3 year investment, and with what I was making down there as opposed to Seattle I felt it was worth it. Shortly after starting, things were not as it seemed. My first week they fired another Hospitalist who had put in his 90 days and reported them to Medicare.  Statements were made about him that were downright derogatory in nature. A nurse who had broken up with a doctor was told “jokingly” during a code to save succinylcholine so they can inject her and throw her into a dumpster. She was too terrified to report to HR and looked like she had a 45 pound weight tied to her back every day. A known sexual abuser with boundary violations was actively protected by the hospital because he was a sub specialist needed in the community. There is more, but you’d be able to google the points and identify the hospital if I went into it. 



The last point with the abuser set me over the edge. I went to the administration and was placated. I also determined that the admin and said specialists were friends. Within 3 weeks, i told them this wasn’t working out and I resigned. I took some locums work throughout the state and given my scheduling arranged for vacation and time off to keep me away from the hospital during my quitting period. 



Within 3 weeks I had gotten a letter from the medical board of that state that I was under investigation for drug use.  They wouldn’t tell me more or less, they only would tell me a vague outline. What came to pass is that the owning organization for this hospital was very concerned with their ceo as they were literally hemorrhaging doctors. He was quite new to the admin world, as I am told, and attempted to save face by giving the illusion he was cleaning house when people were quitting. Still, there I was.  Once I found the report was filed, under guidance from my lawyer, he encouraged me to pay back my sign on and quit on the spot. 


7k to draft an initial response to the board with my lawyer and gather prelim evidence. Plus 7 months of waiting for their investigation. During this time I could barely find employment and couldn’t get licensed back home. I was “stuck”. I ended up doing locums in the poorest, least equipped hospitals in an already very poor state because on each application I had to disclose the pending investigation. It was devistating. I was broke, living out of hotels, and spending every cent I had to try to come back home on my off weeks to spend time with my family.


Eventually the board let me know there would be a hearing due to severe concerns I had violated their rules. Mind you, this is after 100s of dollars in hair tests and time screens that proved I was not on drugs during the time I was there. I was shocked. They had to, at that point, submit their evidence.  To my and my council’s astonishment....there was none. Not a shred of evidence. The administrator said “nurses were concerned he was coming in drunk or high” and he had “stereotyped findings of indicators of impairment.”


Several more months passed until the hearing.  The family member who needed financial help which is why I took it upon myself ended up sicker. My loans were deferred again and again. I had no backup. I was a doctor for less than a month out of residency before everything was taken. 



Finally at the hearing, I was pleasantly shocked. The prosecutor apologized for the lack of evidence in his opening remarks and moved for dismissal. I couldn’t believe my ears. In only moments my life was given back to me. 


 

That administrator is no longer employed, but we may sue him as this report (and the other 2 people filed on, both to state Med boards and Medicare) was not made in good faith. A class action lawsuit can’t give me this year back. It was horrible. My marriage was shaken, family relations tested, and finances ruined. Somehow I’m worse off than I was when I left residency. But finally, finally, I am free

Best practices for sterile gloving- sterile field vs unsterile field.,"I was having a debate with a friend over the best practices for sterile gloving.

My contention is that once the outer layer is removed, it is better to empty out the inner folded paper cover to avoid contaminating the sterile surgical field when unfolding the paper with ungloved hands.

The convention, as far as I can tell, is to dump it out onto a field that is meant to stay sterile.

Why can't I find this case about a girl allergic to water in any medical literature? I've tried Pubmed and various other sources.,"I read a story about a girl who was born allergic to the H2O molecule, and according to both her testimony and her parent's testimony, she once drank a mouthful of water by accident, and went into anaphylaxis, (having to get shots of adrenaline to save her life) she also went into anaphylaxis when they gave her an IV drip that contained water (since they were inserting water into her veins). She survived by hydrating herself with 4 small glasses of OJ.

[please read the following news article in its entirety before posting to avoid misconception - her condition is not just a skin condition - she has severe anaphylaxis reactions to minute quantities of water inside of her body regardless of souce - rainwater, tapwater, or medical IV]

https://www.thefreelibrary.com/JUST+ONE+CUP+OF+WATER+COULD+KILL+LITTLE+HEIDI%3B+Girl%27s+deadly+allergy...-a061152595

I've heard about a skin condition (Aquagenic Urticaria) that causes rashes when people are exposed to water but it is neither an allergy, nor does it cause Anaphylactic Shock and it's a skin condition only, so this is something different entirely as she goes into shock if just a drop of water enters her body. There are other articles on her, such as this one - https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/water-allergy-girl-reaches-21st-58672

She's apparently famous in her country because of her allergy, so I went and searched for being allergic to the H2O molecule in medical literature and couldn't find anything about it.

How normal saline makes SIADH worse,"I generally despise hyponatremia cases, but this is a simple explanation why NS makes SIADH worse. Just want to share with anyone who hates low sodium cases as much as I do: 

&gt;On the surface, it is easy to think that giving normal saline (154 mEq/L) to a patient with hyponatremia from SIADH will help raise the serum sodium. But in the case of SIADH, giving normal saline will actually lower the serum sodium even more. Here is why:  
&gt;  
&gt;Sodium and water handling by the kidney are regulated independently: sodium by aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide; and water by ADH. In SIADH, sodium handling is intact and only water handling is out of balance from too much ADH. Therefore when administering 1 liter of normal saline to a patient with SIADH and a high urine osmolality, **all of the sodium will be excreted, but about half of the water will be retained** – worsening the hyponatremia.   
&gt;  
&gt;With sodium handling by aldosterone intact, in order to raise the serum sodium with IV fluids, the sodium concentration of the administered IV fluids must be greater than the concentration of sodium in the urine – not the serum.

My mom collapsed after stress of my grandma passing away and hard work. Now she has pain and difficulty moving her neck.,"**Hey guys, great community here! Thank you for passing by and your time. I'll try to be brief.**

4 months ago my grandma passed away and my mom went to Our country to organize the burial and fix all the documents regarding heritage and what not. Everything in 1 week. She's very hard working so naturally she made it, it was 24/7 non stop work between organizing the burial and fixing the documents but at the end of all of that, when she started to relax, she just collapsed, unable to walk and move her neck.

Docs said that it's due stress and prescribed pills to relax her. They kinda work but she's always sleepy and doesn't take them. She's much better now, she can walk and do normal stuff, but she's still unable to move her neck without acute pain and has to wear a neck stabilizer.

Seeing that this isn't going away and doc's weren't helping that much, she did a MRI to check it out and here're the results, maybe someone could suggest the best action to take? I love my mom and want the best for her.

I'd also like to extend a warm welcome to two incoming moderators, /u/Calciphylaxis and /u/herman_gill - two established members of the community who will join the moderation team in ~~crushing dissenting voices~~ keep this subreddit clean and focused.

Typically we like to raise a few specific points from the moderators in these threads. Here are the things we'd like to ask for feedback on:

1. How do we feel about the weekly careers thread? Would it be better as a monthly or fortnightly thread to allow for more time to respond to individual questions?
1. We changed the rules with the [last meta thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7i7a7a/meta_lets_talk_about_subreddit_content_and/) to require *all* posts (not just link posts) to have user flair. That's led to much more work for us moderators but, in my opinion, much less slipping through the net to have to be reported and removed later on from the subreddit front page.

Of course, anything else you'd like to raise is entirely fair game. This thread will remain stickied for at least a week and the moderation team will try to keep an eye on the thread and respond to queries and suggestions as they come up.

Please bear in mind that this is a community of nearly 200,000 people and this subreddit is moderated by a few volunteers with day (and night) jobs. Proposed changes should be both philosophically and practically acceptable and should take into consideration this subreddit’s target audience of medical professionals.

Thanks,

/r/medicine mods

Working at the same specialty office where I am a patient?,"Hi /r/medicine. There was a similar post here a week or so ago, but I figured my situation may be different enough to warrant the question.

As the title suggests, I'm considering applying at a specialty office for an FNP position. It's got good hours, good patients, and awesome attendings.

I couldn't be happier with my physician: he is a nationally renowned specialist who pays attention to my input and makes decisions in true collaboration with me (as the patient). He's a brilliant guy and I wouldn't want to change docs if avoidable.

Is there a serious enough conflict of interest that would reasonably prevent me from applying for the position and working alongside my own doc? Given the choice, I'd rather apply somewhere else than terminate my relationship with him so I can apply.

Im 5'8 120pounds, not much to me physically speaking. Also have spent the last few years primarily sitting down, playing video games. I dont drink or smoke and for the most part am pretty healthy as far as i know, apart from my anxiety and panic attacks. And no im not currently on any medication. 

Im going to the local clinic tomorrow but really would just like some peace of mind tonight if possible.

Lingering Body Chills and Low Grade Fever 4 weeks after cold,"Hi,

To get this out of the way, I'm seeing my doctors as is. I just want to ask here for alternative opinions.

I recently went to NYC about 4 weeks ago. Came back with the Human Metapneumo Virus. A type of cold.

What is bothering the most is lingering body aches, chills, and body heating up. My temperature goes up to 99.1. My cold is completely gone but it feels like my body is still inflamed.

I've been tested for everything, even Lyme disease, HIV, and other things not even related.

Only thing they found was elevated ESR.

This is debilitating and I can't deal with the low fever feeling.

Other symptom is ear fullness which they said was hearing loss possibly from the cold. Had an MRI (I didn't use the contrast) and was told everything looks good by ENT. Hearing difference and some hearing loss though which they gave me Prednisone for 3 days (60 mg).

Finished the burst but still difference in hearing.

Can somebody give me an idea of what this might be?

I'm getting depressed from the lingering fever feeling. It's unbearable.

Sexist Hostility in Medicine + Correcting Patients,"John Oliver's most recent episode of *Last Week Tonight* focused, in its entirety, on sexual harassment in the workplace (great episode, please watch). It was an excellent reminder that men (myself included) often do not appreciate the number of small (and large) infractions that many women experience everyday at work. Medicine has an infamously bad reputation on this issue and it doesn't appear to have been remedied (much) in the recent years.

A forthcoming publication in the National Academies of Science/Engineering/Medicine offers a disturbing account of sexual harassment and 'sexist hostility' that female medical students experience, especially relative to other fields. 

You can see the main graphs here (terrible quality image; DL the PDF for better quality): https://www.nap.edu/read/24994/chapter/5#60

**Important points**:

(1) ~50% of female medical students answered 'YES' to questions about experiencing 'sexist hostility'. Sexist hostility is the least problematic form of sexual/gender harassment surveyed, but includes comments like 'women don't belong in medicine,' 'women aren't smart enough to be doctors,' and 'medicine is a man's field,' etc. Female undergraduate and graduate students also experienced significant sexist hostility, ranging from 30-40%; however, it was rated as even more common by medical students across multiple populations. 

(2) Studies find that harassment from patients and their families is one of the top sources of sexual/gender harassment that female medical students and female physicians experience in hospitals. 

**Conclusions**:

Regarding sexist hostility by patients and their families, I'll echo the authors of the forthcoming National Academies report: 

""This inappropriate behavior by patients and patients’ families needs to be recognized by leaders in academic medical centers, and specific statements and admonitions against sexual harassment should be included in the “Rights and Responsibilities” that are routinely presented to patients and families as they enter into both hospital and outpatient care in academic medical centers.""

I'd go further than that, for male residents and male staff (and a lot of us already try to do this at my hospital), be vigilant for 'sexist hostility' in the workplace. It probably seems like a minor inconvenience from your perspective, but if you speak to your female colleagues about it, they hear it all the time. 

Think about the last time that a patient or their family referred to you as a nurse (while wearing professional clothes, with a stethoscope draped around your neck, and an ID bade reading 'Dr.'). Or the times that you hear families who are shocked a that a young resident could possibly be a doctor. Our female colleagues experience this weekly; many, every single day. You can ask them, that shit adds up. I suggest that when you hear a patient engage in something constituting 'sexist hostility,' correct the patient (that's actually Dr. so-and-so or, she's actually your Dr., etc.), that way your female colleague doesn't have to do it for the fifth time this week. It's incredibly simple and they will absolutely appreciate it.

And that says nothing about the much more serious instances of sexual harassment that women in medicine also routinely experience. That discussion will have to be left to a future post.",medicine,1533042421,johnohyahe,227,377,True,2018-07-31

How would someone severely allergic to the H2O molecule deal with their saliva as it's 99.5% H2O?,"Like if they take a mouthful of water they go into anaphylactic shock because they're literally allergic to the H2O molecule (and not simply impurities in the water) and if they get a tiny amount of water in their mouth or veins they can die.

It's a hot topic in the news and on popular science-related YouTube channels lately.

Here's the original story which started the meme - https://www.thefreelibrary.com/JUST+ONE+CUP+OF+WATER+COULD+KILL+LITTLE+HEIDI%3B+Girl%27s+deadly+allergy...-a061152595

It says she's so allergic she once accidentally drunk a mouthful of water and went into anaphylactic shock, requiring adrenaline shots to reverse.

Other articles say a single drop of rain water landing in her mouth can cause her to go into anaphylactic shock.

Yet 99.5% of the molecules in saliva are H2O molecules and the article says nothing about her getting her salivary glands removed. She's perfectly healthy unless she gets water in her mouth or inside of her body. ",medicine,1533075387,StandardStudy,5,0,True,2018-07-31

Fellowships across the country,"Hey everyone!

I'm a new intern at a west coast medicine program. First and foremost, I have really enjoyed the start of residency and also really love my program. It has been busy and fun and I feel fortunate to have matched at the program that I did. As it stands, I think that I would like to do a fellowship afterwards and have recently begun to give thought to spending time in a new area after finishing residency. More specifically, I have thought about spending those 2-3 years of fellowship in the northeast, in part because my girlfriend's family still lives there but it would also be a fun new experience in the adventure of training. Eventually I'd like to come back to the west once it is all said and done but for now am open to what training holds. My question specifically is what are ways that residents can best prepare for fellowships in an area that I have no geographic ties to? Do residents conduct research months at other institutions? This whole process is pretty unfamiliar to me. I plan to keep my head down over the next year in attempts to be the best intern I can be but would also appreciate any insights or experiences that others have had in their training/careers.

Apple Wellness: How Technology Companies are Moving Towards Health Care,"How technology corporations are moving towards health care in the US...Thoughts anyone?

# Apple's first hires for its health clinics show how it's thinking differently about health care

* Apple has made quick work of hiring for its new employee health clinics.
* It has brought on more than 40 people, according to a LinkedIn search.
* These people are focused on care, and not just health, with more exercises coaches, nutritionists, care navigators and nurses on board than doctors.

## Putting the care back in health care

Most of the team hired so far aren't doctors. **In fact, the hires skew toward wellness professionals like nutritionists, exercise specialists and nurse practitioners.** A lot of the hires have a background in alternative or functional medicine and there's even a ""wellness lead"" — Jennifer Gibson, a former head of coaching at Vida Health, a health-tech start-up. Gibson, according to her profile, is passionate about things like nutrition, stress management and smoking cessation, which aren't always offered at primary care practices.

Fever with bacteriuria and no other symptoms,"I imagine this is a very common scenario

A patient spiked fever with no obvious localising source

A full septic workup is done, including screening the urine

Urine is found to be pyuric, but clinically the patient has no symptoms aside from the fever. No chills, rigors, flank pain, nausea or even cystitis symptoms. This is in a patient who can communicate and give a clear history, convincing examination.

A urine culture is taken and the patient is treated empirically for UTI.

An ID physician once told me - UTI as a cause of fever with no localising symptoms is a diagnosis of exclusion - this includes considering non-infective causes especially DVT, central fevers and malignant fevers (some of which are themselves diagnoses of exclusion, but if he can keep them inpatient and monitor he will not treat for UTI unless the patient turns unwell or symptomatic.) 

In my experience most other physicians are quick to treat for UTI anyway, and I can still stomach that.

However, classical teaching is that any UTI with fever should be treated as for pyelonephritis.

Yet in such patients with do not even have lower tract symptoms, most people end up treating the fever as for cystitis. This seems like a rather half-hearted effort to me - like we don’t even believe in the diagnosis and are just throwing antibiotics at it.

What i dont understand is how this happens, the exact mechanism. And i found very conflicting answers everywhere, for example in costanzo it says that during valsalva, the heart rate increases !. some sources mention that there are 2 conflicting drivers for the heart rate, the baroreceptor reflex and respiratory sinus arrhythmia but couldn't find a place to explain this clearly.

Process questions for foreign medical graduate (Colombian) to work in the US.,"First of all, sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this (if not, where is?).

I'm American, but my girlfriend is a Colombian doctor, having been working for about 1 year in Colombia in a rural clinic since finishing school down there. She's starting to research the process of entering a residency in the US. I'm hoping to just get a few questions answered because I'm confused about a few things, and she probably is too.

So it sounds like a foreign medical graduate has to pass the USMLE 3-step test.

\-Is it correct that she would have to pass the first 2 steps, then get accepted to a residency program, and then complete the third step?

This is just a stupid question of mine about the US system:

\-Do all medical school graduates have to go through a residency program, or is that only to specialize?

It's my understanding that it's not an option to just pass the 3 tests and then be able to work as a general practice physician (probably not the right term), but that as a foreign graduate, she \*has\* to go through a residency program. Is that accurate?

She is interested in pursuing a specialization in anesthesiology, but I think she's under the impression it might be possible to work here before starting that program. I don't think that's correct.

Thanks for any guidance on this! ",medicine,1529446691,andrew_wiggin1,1,1,True,2018-06-19
Seeking experiences of others with Physician Health Programs for mental health,"I’m an incoming family med resident, and I’ve posted my story about trying to get licensed before, so if you want more details just look back in my post history. 

Quick summary:
- Had a baby during med school, went back after a week. 
- Developed PPD a few months later. Took two weeks off to sleep, relax, and start an SSRI. 
- Returned to school, made up missed time, graduated on time. Fantastic evaluations throughout. 
- Applied for resident license. As requested, disclosed and explained leave. Psychiatrist wrote letter stating I’m fine but also included (without my knowledge or consent) my psych history which includes PTSD from an assault.  
- Provincial licensing body required my application be reviewed because of “reasonable doubt” that I am mentally competent to practice medicine due to psych history (postpartum depression x 3, anxiety, and PTSD)

My file was reviewed and I’ve been advised I’ll be granted conditional licensure. The condition is that I must be evaluated by our Physician Health Program (PHP) and must enter a monitoring agreement if they require it. This is essentially what I expected to happen, but I can’t say I’m that pleased. 

I am considering whether to attempt to challenge this condition, particularly as I have never had conduct difficulties with any employment or education, for mental health or any other reason. My mental health is managed. I had an (expected) exacerbation, I sought help, as I had the prior two times I had similar experiences after having babies, and was successfully treated.

The wording of the decision seems to paint me as some wilting violet who requires the direction of smarter, stronger doctors because of my presumed delicate constitution. I’m a very independent sort of person so this rankles a bit, to be honest. 

I’ve heard some pretty awful things about PHPs and I’m hoping to hear from people who have had experiences with them, particularly those in Canada. 

I’d be appreciative of insights, suggestions, or experiences. Thanks in advance!

Ramifications of AI on Diagnostic Radiology and Dermatology,"So I think the potential disruption of diagnostic radiology from AI has been discussed at length but I haven't seen as much on dermatology.

In addition, I'm sure you saw the news recently that AI outperformed experienced dermatologists in recognizing melanomas. How do you guys think about potential disruption in these fields and other fields of medicine from AI?

To make a long story short, they were discharged after being treated for sepsis with antibiotics and pain medication, and upon readmission, the hospitalist has taken it upon themself to discontinue the opiate pain medication and the antibiotics even though the infectious disease specialist prescribed them. The only reason the patient had to go back for readmission was that the insurance company denied the prescribed antibiotic (they have a PICC line), resulting in returning symptoms.

Any recommendations on academic resources that consolidate up-and-coming medical research for medical students?,"Hey y'all! Long time lurker and medical student with some questions on finding modern medical research outcomes for pathologies that we learn about in medical school.

Context: yesterday in my genetics/development class our professor alluded to the recent-ish study on BACE1 inhibition in Alzheimer's beta amyloid pathology and it blew my mind. 

My question is two-fold.

1) Does anyone in the Meddit community know anything about the timeline of a BACE1 inhibitor being produced for Alzheimer's patients? Contraindications? Any information is more than welcome!

2) Aside from the occasional rant from passionate medical university professor, are there any resources that consolidate and/or heavily cite scientific journal entries that span across multiple scientific journals and organ systems? I ask this because something like the BACE1 enzyme target isn't something that is clinically proven (yet). Thus, it isn't an obligatory part of medical school curriculum. However, I think many of us would agree that keeping up to date with the research literature (especially for common-ish pathologies like Alzheimer's) is of paramount importance in providing the best care for patients. Any thoughts? Appreciate anything and everything!

I feel like this is a serious missed opportunity to start to treat Hep C, especially for a the homeless/almost homeless population I work with. 

I assume this is because the meds are expensive and not on the hospital formulary - but the government eventually eats the cost of treatment anyway because many people with Hep C have a drug benefit card. This doesn't save any money in the long run, and costs money if people never get treated.

Tort (liability) reform and protections for medical professionals I would support as an attorney,"Standing in line at the pharmacy and hearing an irate customer drop f-bombs like crazy prompted me to post this. And of course the rx was for hydrocodone and someone else used his name to get pick it up...

First off, I don't do medical malpractice so I have no personal stake in tort reform in that regard. After reading about the [Prince family filing suit against an ER physician](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/arts/music/prince-overdose-wrongful-death-lawsuit.html) who saved his life and speaking to some of my colleagues about it, we all came to the same conclusion. It's ridiculous and shit like that gives legitimate attorneys a bad reputation. Incidentally, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff is also a PharmD. Personally, I think the attorney should be sanctioned by the court and if anyone deserves compensation, it's the physician and pharmacist listed as defendants.

Here's what I'd suggest:

1. The current standard of proof for negligence cases is generally by a preponderance of the evidence, which is legal jargon for essentially more likely than not. For cases involving prescription abuse/misuse, the standard should be elevated to clear and convincing evidence (a much higher burden) the physician knew or should have known the patient is abusing medications. Frankly, unless the physician is running a pill mill for controlled medications (which sadly I've actually seen), I don't really think a physician should be liable at all or subject to DEA bullshit. We definitely should not be turning physicians and pharmacists into investigators for drug seekers as if you folks don't have enough to worry about. If a patient abuses the trust a physician gives them, that's the patient's problem and they should bear the consequences entirely. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd rather medical professionals spend their time treating legitimate patients.
2. For egregious cases like the Prince case, I would totally support the Plaintiff's attorney having to pay the attorney fees for the Defendant. It's embarrassing to me as a professional an attorney would even take that case and perpetuates the stereotype that attorneys are parasites that will sue for anything. 
3. Remove damage caps for suits against exploitative quacks, anti vaccine morons, etc. There's literally an ophthalmologist in Florida with a side practice treating MS with 100,000iu of vitamin D per day, charging a fortune for his services, and from my understanding that is dangerous, stupid, and unethical. 

Just some thoughts. I am intending to write an MD state legislator regarding this so if I'm off base or missing something, please feel free to educate me accordingly. ",medicine,1529699595,masteroflaw,55,230,True,2018-06-22

what is so wrong with a gap in my CV as a doctor?,"I went straight from high school to college to medical school to residency.  I am now 5 years out and somewhat burnt out at my current job.  Don't get me wrong, I still love psychiatry, but my current work environment is toxic, and where I was once inspired to tackle problems creatively, I now feel I am powerless to change anything.  I have little autonomy in my day-to-day, and am pressured to practice in a way I don't feel comfortable with.

What recommendations/experience do you have with eReaders (for reading academic material)?,"Hello everyone,

I am applying to medical school this cycle, and as the process goes on I'm starting to realize that I should be reading more medical/scientific journals in order to stay up-to-date and have a better understanding of medicine. 

I was wondering if anyone has had experience with using an eReader (Kindle, Onyx, anything), especially for reading scientific journals articles. If I can be picky, I'm looking for these qualities (priorities in this order):

1. Can access scientific journal articles easily. I would prefer not having to download pdfs and reading them, I want a more direct connection to them.

2. Can access scientific journal articles **for free** via my school library. I usually have to log into my account in order to view articles, but I'm not interested in purchasing an eReader if the only way to access NEJM/Nature is to buy a subscription independently.

3. Paperwhite (I don't like glare)

4. Affordable, if this cannot be met that's understandable, but I'm hesitant to shell out $300+ for something like this.

If you use an eReader in your profession/to read academic literature, I'm more than interested in hearing your experience. Any and all advice or opinions are more than welcomed! Thank you so much!

"Suturing wound, bone exposed","I'm working as a junior resident (or something like that, 5/6 years of med school done, qualified to work under supervision as a doctor).

Recently I sutured a 10cm cut wound which was just on the anteromedial side of the tibia. Wound was only two hours old and still fresh. Fascias overlying the bone were also cut, and so was the periostium. The white bone was visible. 
My solution was simple: I sutured every layer I found - resorbable sutures to periostium and fascia over it and madrass sutures on skin for two weeks. 1 week of prophylactic antibiotic as instructed (kephalexin) 

My question(s): is this correct? Should I have used hydrogen peroxide on the wound before closing? Is there another way to close in on a problem like this? I did all this not in OR but as sterile as I could in first aid clinics procedure room.

Wound was done by some sharp metal. I work in surgery dept and in first aid.

Most gangster physician you've ever encountered,"My working definition of a gangster is someone who makes their livelihood harming people, and affiliates with others who do the same. As fundamentally incompatible with the Hippocratic oath as this may be, let's face it, we've all encountered folks who are only in the trade to get paid, laid, and obeyed, including ones willing to do some very harmful things to certain people in order to make that happen.

I'll start by introducing a very bad-tempered chap I had the pleasure of learning under in medical school, who gave off a very dangerous gangster sort of vibe. He taught one of my outpatient rotations in third year of medical student. He hired only one clerical staff person. He made medical students run every other aspect of his practice, including tasks they were not qualified to do. He purposely started every new rotation of students by giving them some sort of impossible task and then viciously ripping them all a new asshole when they failed at it. He loved it when students cowered in fear of him. An attending at my residency who'd had him years ago when she was a medical student said he'd outright stated that he hated nice people, and thought that the nice had no place in medicine. If a student seemed too nice, he would do his best to try to make them cry in front of a patient. His final reviews for 99% of students were absolutely scathing, and he seemed to take a joy in delivering them. He required his ~~free labor~~ medical students to perform a certain procedure on each and every patient, medically necessary or not, so that he could bill for more money. My medical school eventually fired him from their teaching staff after too many complaints of abuse. This gentleman held the presidency of a powerful national physician organization the year I had him as a teacher, and was famously adversarial in his ""advocacy"" in this position. He also is in tightly with local government in the city where he practices -- he does civil servant preemployment physicals (and basically lets everyone pass), in exchange for a police emblem on his car that makes him pretty much untouchable. He also volunteers to be the staff physician for a nationally famous sporting event every year, and was caught up in a few conspiracy theories concerning this event when this event suffered a terrorist attack which made national news. A friend of mine from medical school was doing an elective rotation in my area on the day this doctor was delivering our weekly academic conference. She'd never met the man, but simply seeing him standing at the front of our classroom, she turned to me and said ""That man is positively *gangster*!"" I would tend to agree. I really would have a hard time feeling bad if something awful happened to this guy.",medicine,1529872090,hononononoh,42,6,True,2018-06-24

Writing about depression in my personal statements.,"Hello everyone, 

Im jotting down ideas for my personal statement and I wanted to hear your opinion about this topic. Ok so long story short, in undegrad, I had a tumor and had two surgeries sophomore year to remove it. It fucked me up, and i got smacked with post-op depression and then it became a long term thing. My grades suffered and my gpa tanked but they didnt suffer cuz I couldnt handle the stress. Even as depressed as I was, I did fine under stress. I didnt find premed courses to be that stressful. my grades sucked because my depressed ass was questioning my existence and meaning in life and simply didnt try hard enough to do well. it also made me question wanting to become a doctor. But, while being depressed and also going to check ups and biopsies at the cancer center, I kinda had en epiphany and realized that I actually wanna get my ass to medical school. Also found out I was depressed because my vitamin b12 levels were basically a zero and that caused a lot of health issues I wasn't aware of. Anyways, now I get shots of b12 and havent been depressed for while. I know that adcoms will be like ""oh she was depressed, what if she gets depressed again? lets take someone who wasnt depressed"" but also a question arises. can they guarantee that someone who wasnt depressed before med school will not get depressed during med school? I would say I know for sure I wont and even if I do get depressed again, I know how to deal with it and I wont let it affect my performance. Anyways, Ive read in a lot of posts that its best to stay away from mentioning it. But I just find it funny that they changed the MCAT to add psych to it to make people aware about psychological aspects of treating patients and yet themselves hold a stigma against mental illness. what im tryna say is that if it wasnt for my tumor and my depression I probably wouldnt want to be a doctor, so it did play a very important role in figuring out what the hell to do with my life.

Point of Care Ultrasound: The Next Physical Exam Tool,"So something I am very passionate about is point of care ultrasound. Long post ahead, but I just wanted to talk about what I have been working on: 

Perhaps the most important aspect of a physician’s role is our diagnostic capabilities.  Truly, if we cannot identify and diagnose a patient’s pathology, with reasonable accuracy, we cannot effectively treat them and may even cause greater harm.  On this topic let’s look back…. The year is 1816 and you are a physician evaluating a patient with shortness of breath.  The common practice of the time was direct auscultation by placement of the practitioner’s ear on the patient’s chest.  At the time, many criticized this technique as providing little insight in the patient’s condition as well being out of normal social standards.  Secondary to these pressures, that year, French physician, Dr. Rene Laennec, invented the stethoscope, which dramatically improved the clarity of the auscultation exam.  He spent the remainder of his career correlating how the stethoscope could detect various chest pathologies, and educating the utility of this technology on improving bedside assessment.  The accumulation of his works resides in his text *De l'Auscultation Médiate,* which is one of the most widely translated medical texts in history.

Now, just over two-hundred years later, it is incredible to think that this technology has not been *disrupted*, especially when you compare the advances mankind has made in other areas.  We have gone from the horse and carriage to cars that can practically drive themselves; from the notepad to the iPad, and can now communicate anywhere on the globe irrespective of language or distance.  In healthcare as well, we have drastically altered our ability to monitor as well as treat our patients.  

Yet despite all of our technologic advances, the stethoscope remains the primary tool used at the bedside for the physical exam.  This is in spite of the widely known inaccuracies produced by the stethoscope guided physical exam.  For example, studies have demonstrated dismal results regarding the ability of the stethoscope to detect common cardiac events with a reported accuracy of 20 to 40 percent.(1,2) Even amongst cardiologists the accuracy of the stethoscope is poor.(3) 

Acceptance of this concept is key for us to innovate. One simply needs to ask themselves: how do you tell the difference between rhonchi or rales? What section of the lung did you hear diminished breath sounds? Or, where is that heart murmur emitted from and what pathology does it represent to realize the severe limitations of the stethoscope?  Moreover, when you compare the scrutiny that we require all modern medical monitors to achieve for their accuracy (no one would use a pulse oximeter that had only a 40&amp;#37; percent accuracy rate), why do we not seek a similar level of accuracy when we discuss the tools we use for our physical exam?  Fortunately, technologic advances have recently allowed for a new technology to be evaluated as **an adjunct**for our physical ex**am, point of care ultrasound (POC**US).

Similar to the evolution of computers, ultrasound machines have become much more portable (some are even pocket size) with functionality similar to “high-end” units used in imaging laboratories.  New technologies even allow one’s smartphone to become an ultrasound device.  This innovation allows the physician to have access to ultrasound imaging during their physical exam at the point of care. 

The utility of POCUS has been demonstrated for nearly every type of physical exam including: cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, pulmonary, and abdominal.  How often have you wondered: what is the ventricular function, how severe is that aortic stenosis, how bad is the COPD, is there a pneumothorax, what is the amount gastric volume, or what is the patient’s volume status?  These are all questions that have proven to be answered “real-time” by POCUS.  

Sadly, the utility for POCUS to facilitate acute care management has mostly been shown in emergency medicine and critical care specialties.(4) This has been viewed with some criticism given the fact that patients have the same comorbidities and acute care events in the perioperative setting.(5) Truly, from a patient care standpoint, why should the skillset for bedside evaluation of the patient change simply because they transition from the emergency room or intensive care unit to the perioperative setting?  

Fortunately, the utility of POCUS to improve patient care in the hospital and ambulatory perioperative settings is starting to rapidly emerge.(6,7) Interest in perioperative point of care ultrasound (P-POCUS) has been reported by anesthesiology trainees along with integration of P-POCUS curriculums into residency training.(8) Moreover, implementation of a perioperative POCUS service has also demonstrated a positive clinical impact.(8) 

While it is encouraging to see the growth of P-POCUS there is much more that can be developed.  Other specialties have developed formalized educational and certification pathways.(5)  Emergency medicine has adopted POCUS training as a “core competency” for residency training. Currently, the certification and educational processes for the perioperative setting are limited, but the concept is growing.

A collaboration of academic programs including Loma Linda University Medical Center, UCI Medical Center, and UCLA Medical Center are working together to help address the need for education and training on this topic.  Every year, more academic programs are developing training curriculums on P-POCUS. 

One such curriculum, termed F.O.R.E.S.I.G.H.T. (Focused periOperative Risk Evaluation Sonography Involving Gastroabdominal Hemodynamic and Transthoracic ultrasound ) has been published as an effective strategy for education. This curriculum incorporates the topics of: 1) Cardiac, 2) Pulmonary, 3) Hemodynamic, 4) Gastro-Abdominal 5) Airway, 6) Vascular access, and 7) Intracranial pressure assessment and highlights their relevance for the perioperative setting.  To further P-POCUS education this curriculum is now online and is open access, under a Creative Commons license ([www.foresightultrasound.com](http://www.foresightultrasound.com/)).  Additionally, training workshops on this curriculum are now available as well at [www.pocuseducation.com](http://www.pocuseducation.com/).

Patient B:at -12 hours gets symptoms, seeks medical attention right away at -11 hours. Gets PCI within 120 minutes. Total time to get PCI was 3.0 hours.

Could use of vasodilators accelerate development of varicose veins?,"I saw a young athlete today (distance runner) who brought up that he had recently developed several varicose veins in his legs that weren't present before. He has been using L-citrulline, a vasodilator (and using VERY large doses, from what I later found online) prior to his workouts for around one year, and he reports that the veins started a few months after that. It seemed ridiculous to me at the time, but do you think the vasodilation from the l-citrulline could have significantly increased the venous pressures in his lower extremities, to the point of accelerating the varicosity? This kid regularly does 10+ mile runs, and it doesn't seem too far fetched that, in conjunction with the stress from the running, even a mild increase in compliance / venous pressure could affect his valves long-term. 

Thoughts?

"Open Letter from Dr. Bob Sears, Recently on Probation after Writing a Letter Recommending that Multiple Children be Medically Excused from Vaccinations","Patients, friends, and colleagues:

I want to update all of you on the status of the California medical board case against me which began in 2015. For those who don’t know, the board has been investigating me for writing a court opinion letter for a child who had an adverse reaction to vaccines. Recently, instead of proceeding to a trial, the board has offered me a settlement of 35 months probation, and I have accepted. I am at peace with this outcome. Probation means that I will choose a pediatric colleague in the area who will periodically review some of my charts to verify I am, as always, practicing within the standard of care. I will also have to take some extra continuing medical education classes and an ethics course. 

Why accept a settlement when I’ve done nothing wrong? The challenge with medical board cases is that even if I win on all aspects of a case, the medical board can still exercise its authority and put me on probation anyway. I win, or lose, a trial before a judge, then the medical board decides the punishment based on how they see the facts. Since it was likely that I’d get probation anyway, I accepted the offer. 



All this for a court opinion letter? Medical boards are normally tasked with protecting patients against doctors who do things like sell drugs, see patients while intoxicated, commit insurance fraud, prescribe a wrong drug that ends up hurting a patient. However, this investigation probably came from higher up the chain of command. I picked a fight with a California Legislator, and he has been very vocal about openly working with the medical board to prosecute doctors who excuse patients from their vaccines, regardless of the merits of a case. I signed up for this.

So what really happened, and why should the very existence of this case concern every American? A child and his mother came to me for help. The mom described how her baby had suffered a moderate to severe neurologic reaction to vaccines almost three years prior, and she was afraid a judge in her upcoming hearing was going to force her to resume vaccines now. Medical records of the reaction were not available yet, and I gave the patient a letter of opinion to show the judge that the reaction was severe enough to justify not doing any more vaccines. The board accusation against me states that such a judgement should not be made without medical records. But this patient needed a letter right away. Getting the patient’s medical records ended up taking over a year. Isn’t it my job to listen to my patients and believe what a parent says happened to her baby? Isn’t that what ALL doctors do with their patients? A patient’s word is often the only evidence we have - as doctors we must trust our patients, the same way our patients trust us to look out for their best interest. After all, I don’t want a child to receive a medical treatment that could cause more harm. I am going to first do no harm, every time. 

The second detail in this case, and the part which ultimately prompted me to agree to a settlement, is the medical board observed that I did not make complete medical notes of the neurological exam I performed on the child at a second visit. The child came in complaining that he had been hit on the head with a hammer. I checked him out thoroughly, performed a complete neurologic exam, but you know what? I didn’t write down all aspects of the exam. I documented everything else but that one detail. 

Is this fight over? No it is not. This was just case number one. The medical board is already lining up four more cases, and these will be about vaccine medical exemptions under the new vaccine law. It seems there is an attempt to keep me on probation for the rest of my medical career. But the one thing I’m going to do differently this time is that I’m going to be very open with all the proceedings. With case one, I was silent. Upon the recommendation of my lawyers I haven’t said a thing until now. But I’m tired of being quiet. 

So, case number two involves siblings who got vaccine medical exemptions from me because one of the children has a severe medical condition that research has shown can get worse with ongoing vaccination. The other child doesn’t have the condition, yet, but dad does. Exemption for reasons in a family’s medical history is an amendment guaranteed under SB277. We’ll see if the medical board agrees - probably about two years from now. These things take a long time.

Case number three is a child with a family member who had a severe permanent neurological injury after vaccines. 

Case number four is a teen who had a severe reaction to an infant vaccine, her own doctor told her to opt out of that vaccine after that, and I gave her an exemption from the teen booster dose. We’ll see if the board agrees. 

Case number five involves siblings to whom I did not give vaccine exemptions to, but a parent somehow reported me to the medical board anyway. I don’t know why yet. Should be interesting. 

It alarms me to see any medical board questioning exemptions that are given to families who have suffered severe vaccine reactions. It should alarm everybody. More doctors need to stand up for their patients, especially the ones who are the most vulnerable. I’m going to continue to stand for these children. 

Now that case one is settled, I can go back to being loud and proud about my belief that every single patient should receive complete informed consent prior to vaccinations. This two-year period of silence has been tough. I will not rest until every single family has been given access to full, complete, objective, and un-doctored information that makes every parent fully aware of the risks they accept if they don’t vaccinate their child, and all the risks they take if they do vaccinate their child. Period. And I will fight against mandatory vaccination laws until they are no more. When every single person on this planet has access to informed consent, and can make a free choice, I will then be able to say my work is done. 

Thank you all for the outpouring of love and support, and your continued prayers.

Frustrating encounters with outpatient docs who prescribe expensive meds without considering cost.,"I'll preface this with the fact that I'm a PICU NP. I don't do outpatient, and I could be better about considering costs when discussing medications or therapies, but often my patients are so sick there aren't really alternatives.  I know healthcare costs are a big point of discussion in this group. I got a phone call from my sister (26 years old, no PMH/PSH, very healthy), crying because she's had this mild persistent stomach pain with textbook GERD/chronic gastritis symptoms (very likely gastritis from NSAID/stress) for a while and finally went to a doc about it. 

This doc told her she needed an ultrasound, labs, *colonoscopy and endoscopy* to rule out stomach cancer (?!) and also here take this super fancy PPI (dexlansoprazole). She called me because she has basically no disposable income to pay for the copays on these things, and her PPI was going to cost her $200/mo out of pocket. 

In contrast, when I went to my own PCP with my stress induced chronic gastritis, he tested me for H pylori, did some routine labs, then put me on omeprazole for a month and tapered off. Boom, fixed. 

It was so frustrating that this doc had scared her into thinking that she needed all these invasive tests prior to even trialing any kind of medication. And prescribed her something expensive. If I hadn't been there to recommend something else she just wouldn't have been able to take the original one and would have continued to be in pain until her next doc appt in 4 weeks or so.

Neuro Case,"So I've really appreciated my interactions with other healthcare providers on social media. I legitimately learn stuff from other neurosurgeons and neurointerventionalists and neuroradiologists, on Instagram and Twitter and LinkedIn. 

I've started asking my patient's permission - although there's no identifying information on these postrs and the histories are often slightly changed - to share on social media. I thought sharing to Reddit as well would be interesting and perhaps allow educational discussion in more than 280 characters. So if this goes well, maybe every week or so I'll throw up a case.

\-------------------

Young guy, history of subacute headaches and ""blurry"" vision. Optometrist actually identified papilledema and in consultation with his primary care sends him to the ER.

Non focal exam.

Right handed.

No history.

&lt;1 ppw, social smoker. Social drinker. Social marijuana.

Initial thoughts on the MRI? Differential diagnoses?

&gt;!The mass is not bright on the non-con T1 which I didn't share. So this is about a 3cm avidly, homogenously enhancing mass right at the junction of the right temporal horn and the atrium. It results in a ""trapped"" temporal horn wherein CSF within the right temporal horn distally is obstructed and the right temporal horn is markedly dilated. In addition to this contributing to mass effect there is significant hyperintense FLAIR signal through the right temporal, frontal and parietal lobes which spares the cortex and likely represents vasogenic edema and results in significant brain compression and midline shift of approximately 1 cm.!&lt;

&gt;!This is avidly enhancing, he's relatively young and it is anatomically associated with the choroid plexus so a choroid plexus papilloma or maybe even carcinoma with that edema, was high on my list. Other strong differentials would be meningioma or ependymoma. Less likely would be metastatic disease considering his lack of history, systemic symptoms and his young age.!&lt;

Any other history? Any other work up? How to treat this?

&gt;!The treatment for this is, as even a layperson might deduce, surgical. Our goals here should be a gross total resection to relieve the trapped temporal horn and edema. There's essentially nothing in the differential that is treated better with non surgical modalities (such as radiation). In addition no other modality is likely to relieve the mass effect or trapped ventricle, which, if progressive, could certainly cause more serious symptoms. And so something like a biopsy is not appropriate. !&lt;

&gt;!I don't think we need more in terms of work up for a diagnosis before the operating room. A full body scan for a primary malignancy probably can be spared off the bat since metastatic disease is low on the list and we'll know the answer from pathology once the tumor is resected.!&lt;

Any major anatomic considerations during treatment?

There are a number of considerations on the approach to the surgical approach the lateral ventricle. The patient is right handed and almost certainly this is in the non-dominant hemisphere. But we should always be cognizant of the cortical speech areas although we should be well away from that even if this was on the left side. ",medicine,1530650942,txmed,0,1,True,2018-07-03
ID Rounds in Brief: Bacteriophage Therapy in the US,"Came across something interesting over the last couple days starting fellowship, and figured I'd share a brief review as I understand it after a couple hours of reading as there is a patient that is being considered for such therapy.  

Antibiotic resistance is a hot topic. One approach that has been considered is bacteriophage therapy, which traditionally has not been a part of Western medicine. A lot the research has, to my knowledge, largely been relegated to the Eastern Bloc and was thought to be ""Commie Medicine."" However, recently USCD has opened the \[Center for Innovative  Phage Applications and Therapeutics\]([https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/research/center-innovative-phage-applications-and-therapeutics/Pages/default.aspx](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/research/center-innovative-phage-applications-and-therapeutics/Pages/default.aspx)). They are working with a company called \[Adaptive Phage Therapeutics or APT\]([http://www.aphage.com/](http://www.aphage.com/)). Interestingly enough, a large number of the phages in their phage library have come from the US Navy, who apparently have a huge library of viruses (vira?) at Fort Detrick in Maryland. There is also a group of researchers at Texas A&amp;M working, as well as another company called Ampliphi Biosciences (where do they get these names?).   

At present, phage therapy is currently available! However, an Emergency Investigational New Drug application to the FDA is required for each use, along with evaluation from the IPATH researchers. Moreover, preparation takes 4-6 weeks. As such, this treatment is largely limited to chronic, multi-drug resistant infections with an indolent course most likely in immunosuppressed patients such as transplant recipients or those with cystic fibrosis. Bacterial samples are sent and tested with various phages, and then a cocktail (or multiple cocktails) of phages are given over a prolonged course - although the methodology remains experimental. In one paper regarding an immunocompetent patient, it was shown that the phages were cleared from the serum in minutes ([Open Forum Infect Dis.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29687015#) 2018 Mar 23;5(4):ofy064. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofy064. eCollection 2018 Apr.).  

As to whether it works, the ""N"" for UCSD appears to be 6, and from what I've gathered they count 5 as successes. The first patients was a professor of psychiatry who had a life-threatening abdominal infection with a resistant strain of *Acinetobacter baumanii* obtained from Egypt, and despite a nadir of 3 pressors in the ICU, has made a full recovery. There are thusfar no reported adverse effects of phage therapy. Case reports have tried to follow endotoxin levels released by lysing bacteria as the most likely source of toxicity, but it has not yet been identified as contributory.  

It is worth noting that phage therapy at this time is adjunctive to antibiotics, and not independent of it. Over time, the MDR bacteria do develop resistance to the phages, although this appears to come at a cost which improves the efficacy of antibiotics and reduces the overall fitness of the bacterium in question.",medicine,1530653728,ShamelesslyPlugged,10,56,True,2018-07-03
Neuro Case Tuesday," Social media in medicine has a mixed reputation but I've certainly learned some bits and networked with neurosurgeons, neurointerventionalists and neuroradiologists on Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram and really enjoy seeing other people's cases and their thoughts. There's no doubt there's a success bias and there's only so much you can communicate in 280 characters but I think online cases have a real educational value.

So I've started posting some to those platforms but I thought Reddit might be a good place as well to discuss some neuro cases. If things go well, maybe a couple times a month I'll post something new.

**What's the MRI show? What's your initial differential?**

&gt;!The non contrast T1 (which I didn't show) doesn't show the tumor as bright. So what we have is a homogenously, avidly enhancing about 2.5cm mass that appears to be intraventricular. Its at the junction of the atrium and the temporal horn on the right. It results in an outflow obstruction and ""traps"" the temporal horn as best seen on the T2 image (image #3). There's extensive FLAIR signal through the right frontal, parietal and temporal lobes reflecting probably mostly vasogenic edema and this results in significant brain compression and nearly 1 cm of right to left midline shift.!&lt;

&gt;!An enhancing intraventricular mass like this should give concern for a choroid plexus papilloma or (considering all the edema what I was worried about) a choroid plexus carcinoma.  Although his age doesn't fit. The differential also must include a meningioma, ependymoma or, less likely considering his lack of systemic disease and history, but not impossible, metastatic diseases.!&lt;

**What's the next step in management? Any other studies?**

&gt;!I'm not sure we need much more in terms of work up. The treatment for this, as even a layperson might deduce, is surgery. There's nothing amongst the differential diagnoses where gross total resection would not be a our goal. He has considerable associated edema and mass effect which he's tolerating well but could certainly cause issues if progressive and so something like a biopsy and then consideration for non surgical control treatment, like radiation, would not be appropriate. I'm not sure we need to subject him to, say, a metastatic work up, preoperatively. The pathology from the operative specimen will tell us the diagnosis and if it is metastatic we can go looking for the primary afterwards. !&lt;

**Any anatomic considerations during treatment?**

&gt;!This is almost certainly on the non-dominant side in this patient. Even if we were on the left side we will be safely away from major cortical structures of concern, namely the language areas. But it is good to be cognizant of them. More importantly will probably be the white matter tracts we're going to violate on our way to the lateral ventricle. Namely the optic radiations. You may be able to limit this disruption by splitting the sylvian fissure and coming from above. We went through the middle temporal gyrus and limited the size of our working corridor and used no fixed retraction in taking this out. Disruption of the pathway along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle may give you a superior quadrantanopia, in this case left. !&lt;",medicine,1530653897,txmed,48,279,True,2018-07-03

Neuro Case Tuesday Conclusion,"As a reminder we had [a 26 year old man with a right sided intraventricular tumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/8vw30g/neuro_case_tuesday/). 

We took the patient the day after admission and went via the middle temporal gyrus and resected the tumor.

*Processing img 2idz7askex711...*

*Processing img y1dhx3zlex711...*

It was a gross total resection. The patient did well. He probably has a left superior quadrantanopia on chairside testing. He has not been through formal visual field testing and like a lot of patient's with this he himself doesn't really appreciate it in everyday life. But otherwise he's recovered great. 

Now the important thing, the pathology turned out to be [meningioma, grade II, chordoid](http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/cnstumorchordoidmeningioma.html). There is [considerable variability in the behavior of these](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23617629).  This apparently, histologically, didn't look very aggressive. But there was considerable edema. Intraoperatively, grossly the tumor actually appeared to respect the ependyma but the edema may speak otherwise to that. The role of adjuvant radiation with gross total resection is unclear.

Stopping codes before they start,"I have a preceptor who says that just because a patient is not DNR/DNI does not mean you are obligated to try to code them. All it means, according to him, is that a nurse has to call a code. He says that when you enter the room, if you know the patient and the futility of the code, you can stop it before anything else happens.

I was reading through my old ACLS manually and came across this:
""The high-performance team must make a conscientious and competent effort to give patients 
""a trial of CPR and ACLS,"" provided the patient had not expressed a decision to forego 
resuscitative efforts and the victim is not obviously dead (eg, rigor mortis, decomposition, 
hemisection, decapitation) (see the DNAR discussion on the Student Website). The final 
decision to stop resuscitative efforts can never be as simple as an isolated time interval. ""

VTE Prophylaxis in cardiac patients on DAPT.,"I'm currently rotating through cardiology at a large tertiary hospital in Aus &amp; have come to notice that we very, very rarely put people on any kind of VTE prophylaxis. 

The typical STEMI patient comes in the door, goes to primary PCI &amp; then returns to our CCU to sit in a bed on telemetry for the next 24 hours &amp; then often moves up to our cardiology floor if they aren't immediately able to be discharged. 

Our NSTEMI patients are similar though usually get enoxaparin or a heparin infusion leading upto their angiogram, but after their PCI are usually started on DAPT with no VTE cover. 

In most cases the risk seems relatively to be mitigated by the short period of time spent in hospital - most NSTEMIs are discharged within 36 hours of admission &amp; STEMIs within 48hrs if they get timely PCI.

Our heart failure patients however often come in for more extended admissions &amp; there are always a proportion of STEMIs who end up with inotrope requirements / APO / staged PCI or are bedbound from their new onset heart failure post-STEMI while rehabilitating.

My question is.. shouldn't all these patients at least be on some kind of chemical thromboprophylaxis? My bosses don't put them on it because they consider the risk of bleeding too high with dual anti-platelets &amp; prophylactic heparin together but I've struggled to find any definite evidence for this.

Sure they won't be able to control the new bodies but since when has medicine been about quality of life? Modern medicine most often just extends life through artificial means anyway and can rarely if ever heal the disabled or disfigured.

What is something that a colleague from another specialty has said to you that left you speechless?,"I'm sure as doctors we have all come across occasions where one of your colleagues has said something that just leaves you completely flummoxed.

I have a couple of recent examples:

The first was a case where a patient unfortunately died and we had no idea for cause of death despite multiple imaging and laboratory studies. We duly requested a post-mortem but were informed by the Pathologist that
&gt;  ""the role of post-mortem is not to identify the cause of death""

This was received with general bemusement all around.

The second was a case of an elderly patient with hip pain, unable to mobilise but no clear fracture on x-ray. The orthopaedic team cheerfully stated that the patient should be under general medicine and when questioned about what they felt could possibly be the medical cause of this patient's symptoms simply replied 
&gt; ""no breaky no takey""

So meddit, what are some of your examples? ",medicine,1527011757,tranmear,660,614,True,2018-05-22

We have been completely lied to.,"I was reading a post on Sermo regarding physician burnout (no surprise), and came across this quote:

&gt;How we salivated at the idea of searchable records, of being able to graph fever trends, or white blood counts, or share records at a keystroke with another institution — “interoperability”! — and trash the fax machine. If every hospital were connected, we would have a monster database, Big Data that’s truly big and that would allow us to spot trends in disease so much earlier and determine best practice and predict complications. But we didn’t quite get that when, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, $35 billion was eventually steered toward making medicine paperless.

My A.T.M. card is amazing: I can get cash and account details all over America and beyond. Yet I can’t reliably get a patient record from across town, let alone from a hospital in the same state, even if both places use the same brand of E.H.R., for reasons that are only partly explained by software that has been customized for each site. This is not like sending around a standard Word file. And so, too often the record comes by fax.

I read that, and got angry.  Not because I disagreed, but because the author was completely correct.  I saw potential about 20 years ago, and was at least cautiously optimistic when large amounts of money and incentives were going to implement EHRs.  

Now, nearly 2 decades later, I see that we were sold a bill of goods.  It's all a bunch of garbage.  I am excited that I don't spend hours looking for a paper chart.  But beyond that, we haven't progressed much.  We were promised integration between health records.  I could see the clinic note from the PCM about the foot ulcer from 2 weeks ago, and get the culture results.  The echocardiogram from another hospital done 3 months ago would be a click away.  I wouldn't have to wonder what the discharge medications were from the pneumonia hospitalization last month.  I could even get the operative report from the washout of the failed total knee replacement done 2 years ago.

It's a bunch of crap.  We get none of it.  We are now chained to the computer, and in the name of ""quality"" spend hours adding phrases and codes to make sure that all ""core measures"" are met.  There is absolutely no interoperability to speak of.  Even EHRs of the same vendor aren't interoperable due to both differences in configuration and enforced segmentation which is done in the name of ""privacy and HIPAA"" but I suspect has more to do with limited patient mobility and keeping their information in their own house.

Data still comes and goes via fax machine.  Signatures are still on paper.  Interoperability, where it exists, is limited and expensive.  Want to integrate  your office EHR with Labcorp?  Sure.  You just gotta pay thousands (on top of the tens of thousands annually for the EHR) for the interface.  Same with Quest.  How do we get information for our own hospital system into our EHR?  Same way we did 20 years ago.  Print it out from the hospital EHR, scan it in, and then stick a name on it.  

And, to really put the cherry on top of this, an administrator very proudly rolled out a tool so physicians can track their own productivity!!   They spent thousands of man-hours on this thing.  1 hour of mandatory training (it's ok, I really didn't want to eat anyway).  And the module for automated outlier screening, promised &gt;2 years ago, is still nowhere to be found.

Questions about ER response time.,"Might be the wrong forum for this, but I wanted to ask for a couple reasons. 

Basically if an ER has a patient with a pretty torn up arm (home bandages with duct tape but her shirt clearly has fatty blood on it) how long would it take to get localized pain meds (Litacain) to the patient. At what point might the delay be considered ineptitude or negligence?.

Now with the actual question out of the way, some reasoning. I live in a small town with the only real hospital for 70+ miles in most directions. Our local college is even known for its nursing program. That being said, I have been hearing things lately about problems with our local healthcare. I even have a trustworthy acquaintance who is currently in litigation with several local services who likely caused his father's death. So with all this hearsay, I am worried about tonight's issue.
My little sister, 21 5'5""ish 133lbs was bitten by her husky/german shepard mix around 10, 10:15. I quickly bandaged her arm with what we had on hand, gathered the kids she was babysitting and rushed her to the ER. We got there by 10:45 or 11 roughly (sorry that I didn't keep good track) and when we checked in there was nobody in front of us. 
Around 11:40 they finally got her some anti-nausea medication and morphine. Last I had heard (12:20 local) she had still not recieved litacain.
 Although shortly after recieving the morphine shot she passed out. Nurse thought it was due to a needle fear. That being said I have never seen my sister in that much pain, and she has a history of getting injured and toughing it out.

Sorry if this came off rambling.

Tldr: my sister was injured and though she recieved morphine apx. 40 mins after getting to ER, she still has not gotten localized meds 90 mins after check-in.",medicine,1527226787,mcspaddin,1,1,True,2018-05-25

Friday Case,"I know I'm just a student, so I hope this is okay, but I got to be involved in a fairly cool diagnostic case a while back. After reading /u/h1k1's case from yesterday, I thought maybe this would be a good one to present here.

An early 40's white male presents to his PCP with a c/c of dysphagia over the last 6 months. He says the dysphagia has previously been mild, and has waxed and waned in severity over the years. In recent months it has become progressively more noticeable and bothersome. He can still tolerate both liquids and solids, but says that food just feels ""funny"" when he swallows, like it takes longer than it should to go down. What's worrying him most is that he has recently developed some shortness of breath in addition to the dysphagia. 

PMHx is significant only for mild, intermittent heartburn which is well controlled with Tums PRN. Family history is significant for CAD and lung cancer, though he cannot recall any details past that. The patient works in a local factory and has been a 2ppd smoker for the past 25 years. He drinks socially and does not use any illicit substances. 

He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, or any recent weight loss. ROS is negative except as previously stated. 

On exam, the patient is a well-appearing male in NAD. Vitals unremarkable. Auscultation reveals some crackles in bilateral lung bases, otherwise no abnormalities. Heart is regular and without murmurs, rubs, gallops, or heaves. Abdomen soft/nontender without distention. Extremities acyanotic, mild pitting edema in the lower extremities. Gross neuro exam normal. 

CBC/BMP is stone cold normal. You get a CXR in the office, which can be [seen here](https://imgur.com/a/wkcU3FV) (note: these aren't his actual films as I don't have access to that EMR anymore, but fairly representative).

Advice on shaky hands for UK Med Student considering the Military,"I'm a pre\-clinical med student and my hands shake when I'm nervous. I'd say that how often they shake isn't uncommon; it's only when I'm really stressed out, such as before public speaking. But I'm under the impression the size of the tremor is significantly above average; I think the oscillations were about 1\-2 cm at the peak of my nerves when I was testing for sensation with a cotton swab during my first ever OSCE station. I think that was about as bad as it could get, as I was holding a feather\-light object with no support while as nervous as can be. Once I calmed down after a couple of stations, my hands were steadier. Also, regardless of nerves, if I have to do really fine work with my hands for too long the fatigue induces the tremor.

Years ago I was prescribed propranolol as a performing pianist, they control my tremor nicely with tolerable side effects \(disrupted sleep for 2 nights\). I'd only take 3 or 4 before the box expired so I rarely used them, but they worked. In an ideal world I guess I'd get another prescription and just take one prior to doing scary new clinical things for the first time like drawing blood, my first sutures etc. The complication is I'd like to apply to join the army, and propranolol automatically bars you from entering.

The army say I can appeal if I don't need propranolol anymore but, while I know I don't need it right now, I have no idea if I'll need it for training in the coming years. I don't want to specialise in anything that will require prolonged intricate use of my hands, and I understand that ""everyone's hands shake when they first draw blood"" etc. But since the amplitude is about 1\-2 cm, I'm worried that I exceed whatever tolerance threshold my superiors will have for the normal shakiness. Best case scenario is that I endure the embarrassment of doing each fiddly technique a few times while appearing Parkinsonian \(presumably with no actual risk to the patient, since lots of people apparently shake at first\), but after not too long I'm not nervous anymore and the tremor's irrelevant. Does that sound reasonable? Also, have you guys found that you generally become comfortable with attempting new clinical skills over time, or are you nervous for every new technique?

Any input would be really appreciated. Thank you!",medicine,1527273484,AggressiveWeather7,0,1,True,2018-05-25

Dresscode for doctors in different countries,"Greetings fellow students and doctors. I'm currently in my 2nd year of medschool in Sweden and we've started going on clinical practice. Which means a lot of learning hygiene routines and such. 

In Sweden, the doctors coat has been removed from the dresscode because of hygiene, and doctors are required to wear scrubs all the time (same for nurses, physiotherapists, and so on) while in the hospital/healthcare center. If you are going into surgery, you change to another kind of scrubs with a different color. All scrubs are provided by the hospital/healthcare center, i've never heard of anyone bring their own scrubs. They cannot be worn outside of the hospital/healthcenter.

Now, to me this makes sence from a hygiene perspective, that when u are in contact with patients, you use appropiate clothing. But when watching documentaries from abroad, i see that in the UK, and also in the US, the doctors are usually using dress shirts and suit pants, sometimes a whole suit. I've also heard that in the US, nurses are supposed to bring their own scrubs, and sometimes wear them when traveling between home and work.

First of all, how does it work in your country/your place of work? And secondly, whats your take on this matter? Should doctors always wear scrubs when meeting the patients?",medicine,1527339644,allezerloot,152,231,True,2018-05-26

A felon walks into an emergency room...,"A felon walks into an emergency room unbeknownst to the staff.  He says ""I'm suicidal"" and earns himself a nice little certificate as well as a hot and a cots for a specific amount of time.  My job as a medical student on a psychiatry rotation is to obtain information on how the hell these guys can gtfo.  This means, calling any emergency contacts and or phone numbers that the patient gives us or doesn't (my state allows this because its an ""emergency situation"" and by god correct me if I'm wrong because this would severely lighten my work load and I'm quite fucking sick of playing telemarketer).

So during the psych interview this guy is typical antisocial.  Drug addicted and oblivious.  Its his world, and we're just living in it.  Manipulative and kind all at the same time.  Until I find a sore spot.

me: Who do you live with? 
     I live with a friend their name is X.
me: What's their last name?  
     Why does that even matter?
me: Because we want to make sure that you have not only a safe home to go to, but that you have a good support system.
     Oh okay.... (the awkward psych silence)
*me staring right through him*
So do you happen to remember a phone number or her last name or any way we can get into contact...
     None of that fucking matters, that has nothing to do with why I'm here.
me: fair enough, lets get back to some pertinent questions
...


After the interview is over I find out that X is listed as this guys emergency contact (he's been here before).  (unique first name)  bingo.  After that phone call I find out why this guy doesnt want us to know her last name or her phone number. He has restraining orders, prior felonies out on parole, beat the hell out of someone and has restraining orders, currently has warrants for felonies in a neighbor state.

Now I've fudged a few details and added in some so that this remains almost completely anonymous.  I'm not asking for advice because this event has come and past and I've already done what I thought was right.  My question to you is this:

Given that my institution doesn't ""allow"" us to contact police regarding this phone call information, What would you do?  I'm in the USA.  This is one of my throwaway accounts.",medicine,1527389100,swys,108,154,True,2018-05-26

Fetal radiation risk: where is my calculation going wrong?,"On the article in uptodate titled ""Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and nursing women"", the authors say:

From the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which this article also cites:

&gt;occupational radiation exposure of pregnant women not exceed **5 mSv** to the embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy 

Unless my calculation is wrong here, 1 rad = 10 mSV, so the maximum fetal exposure of 5 mSV = 0.5 rad. So I'm not understanding why this article says 5 rads is safe? Is it because NRC is just too conservative?",medicine,1527480970,princetonwu,16,12,True,2018-05-28

How do you calculate fluid/sodium replacement in a hyponatremic patient in the practice setting?,"Soon to be pharmacist with a question for you guys \- I tried asking this in r/pharmacy and got very little as a response.  
\-\-\-\-\-

We've had an unfortunate situation with an ODS patient secondary to inappropriate fluid bolusing. This has caused quite a discussion amongst the pharmacists I work with \(as an intern\) on the appropriate way to calculate this and it was found that people were doing it very differently. 

One report in the incident was that there was no weight recorded for the patient so it was not possible to calculate a safe rate. However some pharmacists feel like you don't need a weight at all and you can use a generally safe rate \(they did not elaborate on what this generally safe rate is or how to calculate it\).

The other issue is choosing a target sodium level. Most can agree upon 120 to 125 as a range to choose. However, they cannot decide upon a cut\-off for determining when you use 120 or 125.

We also realized that pharmacists were using different references for their calculations. Some were using old school notes while others were using MDcalc and global rph.

I have never actually had to calculate this yet in practice. Is there a generally agreed\-upon way to do it? How are you doing it in practice? You can use hypothetical numbers or generalize for different etiologies \(ETOH pt\) if it's easier to explain with an example.",medicine,1527553959,avaprolol,21,32,True,2018-05-28

"As a recently recently graduated physician, is it normal for your SO to not trust your medical advice?","My wife and I had an argument about children's Tylenol dosing the other day.   

Both our children are in the 95th percentile for height and weight. Our 3 (almost 4) year old girl was sick and had a fever of 102 degrees. Because our child is the size of most 5 year olds, I decided it was more appropriate to give her dose based on her weight and not by her age. My wife did not like this and refused to give her that much because the back of the bottle it said the amount I was giving was for 4-5 year olds. 

I decided it wasn't worth fighting over at the time and just gave her the normal 3 year old dose. 

This type of thing or something similar seems to happen about once a month. She will read something on a blog about ""detoxing"", or ""healing through essential oils"", and I try to kindly explain to her why that the advice is based on pseudo science, and she seems to disregard my opinion and believe whatever trendy thing she read on the internet.

I'm not really asking for how to deal with any of these specific examples I've mentioned, but I am wondering if this type of scenario is normal?

My only logical response is that I'm only 1 year removed from medical school and it's still wierd for her to think of me as a doctor. I'm not really sure how to gain her trust in regards to medicine related topics though.

I know I'm still a very young physician, and don't know everything. Heck, even a lot of the education and training I have had over the years may even be flawed. But I feel like a lot of the stuff we argue about is argue about is common sense type of stuff within the medical field.

Where did this come from? I mean I understand the point of articulating a normal physical exam - i.e. no JVD to show that you checked for JVD and there wasn't any. Perhaps you can call it a screening test in some cases. But I don't get the point of this. Atraumatic? To screen for an open skull fracture just if you were wondering? Making sure the COPD'er doesn't have brain tissue sloughing out of their head? Normocephalic? Yes, he's got a head and it looks to be oriented correctly.

I can understand this MAYBE being part of an ED physical exam assessment when you could be worried about some kind ""occult head injury"" in the alcoholic or someone presenting with a headache or whatever.

Random question about physician education,"Are there different levels of MD? I apologize for my ignorance, here is the context, and also, I could ask one of the docs I work with, but it seems like an unacceptable level of ignorance on my part, that I don't want everyone I work with to judge me for.

Context: an RN has a few ""levels"", especially if you count LPN/VPN. You can continue and get an NP, or other Advanced Practice degrees such as Clinical Nurse Specialist etc. Each ""level"" has an expanded scope, more knowledge etc.

Physicians (MD/DO) have residents and attendings, but that's not really the same. Is there really any equivalent between RN and MD?  My guess is that there is not. I've never encountered an MD or DO that can do more or less (in terms of scope) than another, particularly within a specialty. 

I'm just curious really. But I can't find anything (with a quick Google) that can clarify.

Help: My mother has been experiencing chronic pain for 9 years since she got her titanium hip replacement.,"My mother has been experiencing immune system problems and subsequent chronic pain, since getting her hip replacement approximately 9 years ago. Never had any chronic pain symptoms prior to replacement. Her quality of life is not very good right now, and despite all the medication her rheumatologist keeps chucking at her, nothing has improved.  


Her Plasma Cobalt/Chromium levels: 60 nmol/L (&lt;26) for dedicated trace element tubes. For other collection tubes up to 170 nmol/L have been observed. 


I believe that the titanium is acting like a pathogen and her immune system is constantly attacking her own body over nothing. She has visited many revision surgeons and none of them agree with her concerns that a high concentration of metallic compounds in direct contact with her blood stream would have any causal relationship with her chronic pain/immune system problems.  

Obviously I am just a layman and have no authority on the matter, but I find it very difficult to believe that there is no relationship here. Can someone help me understand how I am wrong on this matter, or or if there is anything she can do about her predicament?

How does surgery scheduling work?,"We've recently (also in the past, but the past few weeks have been worse than usual) been having a problem with surgery schedules and blood product availability- whoever makes the OR schedules has been putting people with complex antibody problems as first cases, and giving us 16 hours notice *at best* that they'll need ten units of rare blood with more on standby. We can't work miracles, and it's been a lot of frantic consulting with our residents and attendings to try and waive requirements, blowing up the ARC's phones, top speed crossmatching, and sometimes having to cancel surgeries (this makes the ORs mad.)

Ethics - Morbid Obesity and Emergency Equipment/Intervention Limitation.,"Hello /r/medicine,

Is there a standard of care or options for care in regards to patients that are morbidly obese that equipment or interventions cannot be used due to their size? 

Obviously, there are equipment limitations (E.g., CT circumference, US quality, etc.) but in the case of that information leading your ultimate treatment and intervention. What would be done in the alternative for morbidly obese patients in the emergent setting (traumatic injury)?

As far as intervention, in the elective intervention side, it is common to withhold certain things due to a patient's morbid obesity such as knee replacements, weight loss surgeries, etc.

The question posed is due to a patient I had recently: A 48yo male; morbidly obese. Motorcycle (he was on) versus car at a high rate of speed. Initially, decent blood pressure 130/80ish, declined to 70/40 after arriving at a level 2 trauma center. The decision was to transfer this patient from that level 2 trauma center, to another level 2 which had a bigger CT due to his size.  Ultimately it delayed surgical intervention by 2 hours, but in this situation what can be done?

Thank you for your time /r/medicine.",medicine,1524158310,Adealia,30,13,True,2018-04-19

Evidence based medical information resource,"Probably this is a long shot, but maybe a few people in this sub have an option on this. I’ll try to make my point as compact as possible:


We’re operating a large KOL written evidence based medical information resource \(not available in english yet\), which is highly frequented and valued by many physicians and medical professionals. In comparison to Uptodate it is much more vertical, but so far only covers five medical fields. In total we have 26,000 detailed articles allergology, dermatology, cosmetology, vascular medicine and naturopathy \(internal medicine to be released this later year\). Our users primarily use our resource during POC but also for education and research purposes. Soon we're opening up our content management system for verified physicians, who can earn credits and have their names appear in Google as author/co\-author/translator alongside with the name of the KOL. Of course, before publishing everything is being checked by our editorial board.


Access to all information is completely free of charge, because we believe this type of information does not belong behind a paywall, but should be available to any physicians for free. Not every physicians can afford to pay for Uptodate, Springer Med \(we licence some of our content to them\) and alike and it helps to improve general patient care. This is the way it should be.


However, we've already invested substantial amounts of our own funds and it is quite expensive to operate and maintain. So in the long run the site needs to be monetized to be able to compete against the large medical publishers. 

Currently we're offering marketing opportunities \(banner ads\) to Big Pharma, which goes well, but is difficult to scale and poses a perceived threat to our independence \(which we value very much\). This is why we are looking into other concepts that do not include physicians paying for medical content. We’re working on turning the site into an expert network similar to Sermo, Doximity or Figure1. There will be chargeable premium features such as usage free of ads, own bookmarks/notes, additional search filters, job market/posting job offers, follow authors/topics, view profile visitors and so on. 


So our questions are: 

* What are your thoughts on creating an expert network? Which aspects/features do you like on other networks \(sermo, doximity, figure1\), what are you missing? Please be as specific as possible.
* Would you think that letting authors participate in the earnings \(they help generate\) be an real incentive, or rather good will?
* To what level would you guesstimate participation from professional\-user\-generated content and how valuable do you think this content could be to the community?

Any helpful comments will be appreciated!

Please note that we prefer not to disclosure the name of our site at this point. But if you PM me and provide me your email address , I can inform you when we’re about to launch the english version. Also, I created a new username for this post, because I’d like to keep this separate from my other reddit activities :\)

"""My acupuncturist told me I have a lung chlamydia or mycoplasma, just give me my antibiotics""","*Some details have been changed so there is no way this could be linked to any real patient*

The situation happened some time back, I was helping out a GP, he had appointments in another room. He trusted me quite much, I usually saw patients by myself and asked for his help when I didn't know what to do.
So, there's a lady put into my appointment, GP had assigned an hour of appointment time with her. Oh well, nothing weird, happened all the time, usually with patients with lots of medication and comorbidities. Didn't ring any bells before the appointment. No previous information was also available about that patient, but that wasn't that uncommon either.
I called the patient in, asked what the problem was. Conversation was as follows:
Lady: I came from my acupuncturist, I have been coughing, they told me I have lung chlamydia or mycoplasma and I need antibiotics.
Me: Oh, alright, so we need to evaluate your condition for sure. How long have you been coughing.
Lady: About a year now.
I proceeded to take a detailed history and physical examination. Nothing too interesting. No history of fever, illnesses, only that cough got worse when she was lying down. I noticed though, that jugular veins on the neck were visible when she was standing up.
Me: ""So, we need to take an X-ray now and after that, some blood analyses""
Lady: ""No no no, I just want to take the antibiotics so I can get rid of my cough. I don't want an X ray or blood analyses.""
Me (internally 0.0): We can't prescribe you antibiotics when we are not sure that you really have that problem.
Lady: But my acupuncturist told me I have this! Also I'm so fed up with that cough, I want to start antibiotics today.
I spent the whole hour talking with her about the need of an X ray, and guess what: she did have one finally!

On the X ray there was a widened mediastinum, so she was promptly sent to CT (struma and some mass at right lung), and lung biopsy - she had tuberculosis!

Tl;dr - a patient demanded antibiotics for atypical pneumonia, I refused to write any without an X ray, via X ray it was possible to find out she had tuberculosis.

My favorite has to be [Beau’s lines](http://amjmed.org/optimal-systolic-blood-pressure-target-after-sprint-insights-from-a-network-meta-analysis-of-randomized-trials/) -- these are transverse ridges on the fingernails that are associated with MI, sepsis, chemotherapy -- really any major stressor to the body.  They were first described by [Joseph Honoré Simon Beau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Honor%C3%A9_Simon_Beau) in 1846 from his work on patients with cardiac disease (fun fact -- apparently Beau’s syndrome is also named after him, and I’d know more if I could read French, but Beau’s syndrome appears to be what we’d today call “asystole”). It’s related to Mee’s lines (white lines in the nails with NO indentation, classically seen in arsenic poisoning, but these days seen commonly in chemotherapy) and Muehrcke's nails (discoloration in the vascular bed of the nail, so they disappear with pressure and don’t grow with the nail; classically associated with nephrotic syndrome and severe hypoalbuminemia -- but of course, also chemotherapy).


I love Beau’s lines not because they’re incredibly clinically useful. I couldn’t find any data on them, but even in my own experience they’re not terribly sensitive, and they never tell you anything that the patient wouldn’t just tell you. The reason I love them is because nails grow at a pretty predictable rate -- about a millimeter a week. So when you ask your patient what happened four weeks ago, they think you’re some kind of wizard.


The best example that I ever saw was on a friend of mine who did wilderness trips -- two weeks in the high desert, followed by a week in civilization. They asked me what was going on with their fingernails -- and had the finest set of Beau’s lines I had ever seen. Naturally I didn’t take a picture.


Final reason I love them: Otzi the Iceman, the oldest mummy ever discovered, [also had Beau’s lines on exam](http://bedside-rounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/otzi-beaus.jpg), which has led researchers to assume he suffered repeated bouts of trauma 8, 13, and 16 weeks before death. [I even did a podcast about it](http://bedside-rounds.org/episode-17-the-iceman/).

- I’m trying to figure out the most effective ways of getting a referral base for new patients.



- What do FPs / GPs / other attending look for or like? 



- Is there anything that you’ve seen work really well?



- Some of my colleagues have done letter drops (minimal effect) and GP educational sessions (slightly more but still low effect) to try build a referral base.



- FWIW I’m in Australia and going to be doing pretty general plastic surgery (skin, hands, cosmetic). 

- Thanks for any advice given :)

Evaluating patients after hours,"I'm curious how everyone handles outpatient issues after hours while on call, particularly in outpatient specialties. For example, when a patient calls after hours with an issue that doesn't merit an ER visit, where do you see the patient?

At our academic facility, we are instructed to have the patient come in to the ER for all after-hours issues. This is for a number of reasons, including the risk of being alone with a patient in an empty clinic, the risk of the patient having a medical emergency without a code team immediately available, and the inability to document in a dedicated encounter, since the patient hasn't ""checked in"".

Of course, for very simple issues, this seems like overkill, and I'm curious about how everyone handles it. Do you have a system in place for seeing these patients without running up a big ER bill?

Edit: Thank you for your thoughtful responses so far. To clarify, I'm referring to medical issues that need to be seen overnight, but that are not in any way life-threatening. Ophthalmologic issues would be a good example.",medicine,1524610548,goingmadforyou,40,25,True,2018-04-24

What Differences Exist Between How A Podiatrist and Foot and Ankle Orthopedic Surgeon Can Practice?,"I hope this question is appropriate here but I'm legitimately curious and wasn't sure where to find a better answer. 

For the sake of discussion, the orthopedic surgeon is fellowship trained in foot and ankle surgery, and the podiatrist is residency trained in podiatric medicine and surgery residency.

Please also bear in mind for some of this I really have no idea what I'm talking about because I'm in my sophomore year of undergrad.

Some of my questions are:

1. What difference in scope of practice exists between these two professionals within the foot and ankle? Obviously the orthopedic surgeon has training outside of the foot and ankle so please don't list that as a major difference, it's implied.

2. Are there any notable differences in procedure success rates, patient outcome, patient satisfaction, etc.?

3. Are there significant differences in cost when the same procedure is performed by different professionals?

4. Can these professionals manage similarly complex cases?

5. What differences do these professionals exhibit outside of surgical practice? Do these professionals perform similar managament of long term foot and ankle problems?

6. Are there major differences in what kind of acute cases these professionals can manage (i.e. metatarsal fracture, fibula fracture)

7. What opinions do you have about the difference in treatment between a podiatrist and a foot and ankle surgeon?

NOTE: I'm not using this post as a way to determine what career I might like to follow. I shadowed a foot and ankle orthopedic surgeon for a little while and while doing research on procedures he performed I found many articles about them written in Podiatry journals by DPMs. An example of these procedures is 1st MTP arthrodesis.

MODS: Please remove this if it doesn't fit the rules. I think it does but I'm not sure. If you remove it I'd appreciate a suggestion of where else to post this because I am looking for answers.

Advice on dealing with malingering patients? (And their parents...long post warning my apologies),"I had a 7 y.o black female today present for an eye examination. Had a trauma to her right eye about 2-3 months ago (another child had hit her at after school care with some sort of ball). 

The patient complains of a dull pain and severely reduced vision in that eye ever since. Mother has taken her to 2 different eye doctors who told her everything was within normal limits and no deficits of any kind were noted. 

Medical history: patient was born premature at 32 weeks but without major complication. 

Ocular history: never worn glasses before and largely unremarkable with the exception being the trauma 

Family history is unremarkable 

My exam findings revealed count fingers acuity in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. 

Pupils were PERRLA with no afferent pupillary defect. 
Confrontation fields were restricted in the right eye and normal in the left. 

Refraction with cycloplegia yielded +0.25 in the right and left eyes with both eyes being corrected to 20/20 acuity. 
I had to convince my patient however the right eye was seeing through a “very strong lens”. For non eye people +0.25 is essentially no prescription. 

Anterior segment, dilated fundus examination and intraocular pressures were all normal and unremarkable. 

I explained to the mother my findings and that glasses were not indicated and that she is likely exaggerating her symptoms. The mother became slightly aggressive and stern in her tone and accused of me lying to her child by saying it was a “very strong lens”. I told the mother often times young children will exaggerate symptoms in order to seek attention or for some other emotional/psychological reason but that her daughters eyes were perfectly healthy. Mom was not happy with my explanations and told me they would seek a fourth opinion.

Hi Redditors! Here is the situation: My friend is a physician who has had the misfortune of being sued a number of times. I am not sure exactly how many times (he won't tell me), but it somewhere in the neighborhood of ten times. He is currently working but has been trying to switch to a role with more upward mobility. However, he keeps getting turned down from jobs due to his malpractice history. He is worried that he is essentially unemployable and will be in tough spot if his current job does not work out. Do any of you know what his options are if he wants to move/protect his liability? Can he work at a VA hospital? Or for the military? Any thoughts/insights would be appreciated.

Justification for the ongoing use of Greek and Latin root words for medical terminology?,[removed],medicine,1524948549,bad52292,1,1,True,2018-04-28
Justification for the ongoing use of Greek and Latin root words for medical terminology?,"I'm new to medicine, and by that I mean I have no medical training, but I am eager to learn and go on to a career in medicine. To that end I have been devouring everything related to it that I can get my hands on, A&amp;P on khan academy, audio books from the great courses while I'm at work, I've even started to go back to college part time for the basic sciences. 
Throughout this I have noticed a theme, there is a scientific language, and if you don't learn to speak it, and speak it well you're not going to have an easy time learning medicine. 

Many, if not most medical terms seem to have their roots in Greek or Latin. I can understand this for organs and old diseases dating back to the cultures they were identified in, but why are we continuing shouldn't new terms reflect the language of the person coining the phrase?

Why say Microcephaly when you could just say small head? 
Why mastectomy instead of breast removal? 
Subcutaneous instead of below the skin?

I feel like this practice creates an unnecessary barrier to entry to medicine for the masses. It reminds me of ancient priests reading sermons to their congregation in a language none of them could understand, it's not the same but reminiscent of that to me.

I understand the hesitancy to change, it's the reason we still have the inch in the US. There are a lot of practical reasons not to change an established norm, but how long is long enough? How many more thousands of years should almost all of our medical terminology be based on a long dead language? If the goal is wellness and a patient-doctor relationship is key to that, shouldn't we speak the same language? 

Also:
Is medical lingo truly universal? Does mastectomy mean the same thing all over the world? If not why are we holding onto it?

TEST PREP SESSIONS Offered By Former Standardized Patient from COMLEX Level 2-PE,"Hello!

As a standardized patient for four years as part of the COMLEX Level 2-PE, I saw and scored thousands of student doctors. I have also played a student doctor in various training sessions. Having recently been in conversation with other SPs and the individuals training them to score, I understand the behaviors and demeanors that will lead to a smooth testing experience and high scores. From my experience, I have intimate knowledge of the scoring tools; the rhythm of the 14-minute encounter; and the most effective strategies to be confident, calm, and effective.

Unlike other exams, in the COMLEX Level 2-PE you interact with individuals that hold the information you need write SOAP notes that help you pass the exam. I can tell you about how they are trained to test you, how they are taught to answer your questions, and what their experience is like in the room. With this knowledge, you will save time in encounters by getting the information you need.

I have reviewed the test prep that is available to student doctors and find it to be incomplete or misleading. For example, Mark Kauffman, DO places great importance on facets of the exam that are not considered in the scoring tool and glosses over important moments in the encounter. It's not hard to pass the test, but the most effective ways to do so are very specific.

My focus is on the Humanistic Domain. I can teach you:
Concrete Communication Skillls that will keep you on track, present and warm
Actionable Interpersonal Behaviors that receive high scores
Professional Conduct to keep you confident and endear you to SPs
I have created test prep materials based on my knowledge that I am offering to student doctors who will soon be taking the test. I am available over Skype or to meet in person. I am also available to answer questions you may have. Contact me at comlexpeconsultant@gmail.com to discuss your needs, what questions you have, and how I can offer my services.

I have information that is overwhelmingly unavailable in test prep. I care about training the future doctors, so I care about helping you! ",medicine,1525102370,comlexpeconsultant,0,1,True,2018-04-30

"Plant based diets, are they worth the hype?","I've read several articles lately purporting the benefits of various plant based diets, they are claiming significant improvements in weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and all cause death rates over the course of the study. 
When I took a closer look at some of these studies i found there was no control for weight. Maybe this is obvious considering tracked weight loss, but since a reduction in weight, (often times regardless of the method in which the weight is lost) results in similar effects is there actually any significant benefit to following a plant based diet if you are already reasonably healthy? 
I think these studies are trying to point a causal link from these benefits to a vegetarian diet. When it may just be that the diet results in weight loss and weight loss provides the benefits.

Are there any studies out there that show similar benefits when weightloss could not possibly be a factor? 
ie: Studies where patients weighed more or less the same before and after the intervention of this diet, but still showed the remarkable benefits in BP, diabetes, cholesterol, heart disease, &amp; death rate. ",medicine,1525128113,bad52292,50,15,True,2018-04-30

"Talking to a person with ""chronic Lyme""","This is sort of a personal situation, but I'm not asking for medical advice so I figured it was worth a try.

A friend of mine believes she has ""chronic Lyme disease"" and (because May is apparently Lyme Awareness Month) recently put a post about all of the ""treatment"" she's getting, complete with pictures. I haven't been in close touch with her over the past few years so I'm not sure when she got the ""diagnosis"" and started getting ""treatment"", but I'm not surprised--she'd been having a lot of vague symptoms for a while and her mom has been a long-term ""chronic Lyme"" patient. 

From everything I've read, ""chronic Lyme"" is a BS diagnosis and my friend is getting useless and possibly harmful ""treatment"" (not to mention how much money it's costing her). I'd love to convince her that she doesn't have chronic Lyme, but I'd settle for persuading her to stop the ""treatment"" she's getting. It seems like that'll be really tough, though; I'm guessing she has a lot invested (psychologically and financially) in this diagnosis and ""treatment"". It doesn't seem like talking to her will accomplish much, but I really want her to stop getting all this useless and invasive testing and ""treatment"". Does anyone have any tips about how to talk to her about this? Has anyone worked with a patient who's convinced they have chronic Lyme or a similar ""disease""?",medicine,1525370602,the_other_paul,53,63,True,2018-05-03

Despite having the same job for 10 years, I find myself getting further behind every day (often 20-40 minutes) and bringing more work home (5-20hrs depending on the week).  

Clearly this is a multifactorial problem, but I'd like suggestions in 2 specific areas of what has worked for you:

1) patient scheduling.  How do you set up your patient schedule? Do you build in time to catch up on charting and administrative work?  I'm thinking of trying 3 15-minute patient visit slots and 1 15 minute catch up slot per hour.  Anyone try this?

2) Epic efficiency.  What has been most helpful for you? Can you share templates or dot phrase ideas?  I use several of each, but think there's room to improve and expand on my current repertoire.

"From a supply and demand standpoint, why is it that FM, on average, is paid lower than other specialties?","We see on the news all the time how America is in need of more physicians. And not just any type of physician, but FM more often than others.

Yet, if you were to survey my entire medical school, I'd say about 20% actually WANT to do FM, even though since we are a DO school, more than likely a large portion of us will end up FM. (I'd say about 60%+ say they want surgery, EM, or Derm as M1s and M2s). 

This has a lot to do with money/lifestyle if you ask them. So I'm confused as to why FM is paid less on average if FM is technically the most in demand in the US. 

Edit: thanks to everyone who has taken some time to respond to me! I honestly had zero clue how medicine as a business works. I don’t have any immediate family members in medicine and I never really thought to ask questions about this aspect of it. I’ve just always been told “doctors make good money! You can be one if you work hard!” And then I just saw hospital salaries and that’s as far as I looked into it really. ",medicine,1521496836,redmaninjun,70,107,True,2018-03-19

ECG Case#2,"Hey medditors, here is another interesting ECG case I came across recently. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7zklhr/er_ecg_case_1/) is the first case I posted a few weeks back. 

Case scenario (sorry for the length):

You are working an overnight shift in your busy community ER. Although your location has an EMR, physicians still pick up physical charts in order to claim patients. You pick up the chart of a patient that is in bed 12. You see that on the physical chart she is a 66yo F that has presented for chest pain. The patient's triage vital signs are T: 98.4F, HR: 61, BP: 185/111, O2sat: 99%. Under the triage report the following is stated: ""The pt arrives via EMS for severe substernal chest pain. The pt is diaphoretic and has had multiple episodes of emesis. EMS gave pt 325mg ASA, 2 nitro sprays, and nitropaste was placed on the patient's chest without any improvement in pain."" (Despite my frequent objections, our triage nurses continue to write too much on the triage report). You quickly look through the physical chart and see that there is no ECG present from my facility or from EMS, and you have not signed any ECGs recently. The patient has been in the department for 30 minutes. 

You quickly go into the room to make sure the patient is okay and find her clutching her chest (positive Levine's sign) and in significant distress having difficulty cooperating with history taking due to pain, and the nurse is in there attempting to get a line. The patient states her pain started 1 hr prior to presentation and is a burning pain w/o radiation. She only has a history of poorly controlled hypertension stating her BP normally runs between 160-180 systolic. On exam, she has 2+ symmetrical pulses in all extremities, she has no murmurs, and lungs are clear to auscultation. You tell the nurse to give sublingual nitro and to keep giving it every 5 mins until the pain stops or she has received 3 doses, and then come let you know how she has responded. You also inform her that the next time she has a patient that has severe chest pain such as this, she needs to find the doctor to evaluate the patient ASAP.

You tell a tech to call the ECG tech overhead stating you need them immediately. They arrive and state they have already done that person's ECG, they have just been doing a few more before giving it to you for evaluation (the ECG is displayed below, there is no previous). You inform them that we are a chest pain center and that we are expected to have these ECGs performed and evaluated on all chest pain patients within 10 minutes of the patient's arrival to the ER. You then ask that they keep repeating ECGs every 20 minutes until they are told to stop. 

ECG #1:  https://i.imgur.com/56mmztR.jpg

The tech returns with the 2nd ECG (shown below), sighs, and states ""Do I really have to keep repeating ECGs every 20 minutes?"" You take a look at the ECG and state ""No, you need to do it every 15 minutes now until I tell you to stop."" (This was not punitive, the ECG was cause for significant concern). Meanwhile, the patient has had no relief with 3 sublingual nitroglycerins. You tell the nurse you are ordering 100mcg of fentanyl and starting the patient on a nitroglycerin drip with instructions to keep titrating up until either pain has completely resolved or the patient's SBP drops below 120 (current BP was 180/117). 

ECG #2: https://i.imgur.com/KSYmA5C.png

The tech then returns with the third ECG (shown below). 

ECG #3: https://i.imgur.com/ZltyCSn.png

[SERIOUS] Harrassment/Discrimination/Retaliation from Supervisor,"I have a supervisor who has a personal vendetta against me. I’m not sure why, but I know he has a reputation of going after people passive-aggressively for personal reasons. 

My manager ignored my attempt of meeting with her individually and I had a coworker come to me in private and tell me someone on day shift had brought up to our manager that this supervisor precipitated a hostile work environment during shift change. She then asked this coworker to come talk to her about it but this coworker is afraid of retaliation. 



I don’t know what to do but I know this supervisor has painted an inaccurate slanted picture of me to my manager and I know by how she ignored my request for a private meeting that she doesn’t much care to follow up on the topic. He created a laundry list of circumstantial things that I’ve done that’s unprofessional like cry at work and some of the things were completely untrue. I have only cried in his presence and alone after walking away to be private in which he has followed me and has made me feel more anxious, hence the crying from what was already a high stress situation.



I’m developing a case in my head but it relies so heavily on the support of people speaking up around me and I’m afraid they won’t. I also know I’ll have to go to Employee relations/Human resources since my manager has showed no sign of support which I know is a sticky move. I’m also afraid for my family because I am the only one working right now and people have told me to line up a job in case this goes south but I love where I work aside from this situation. I wanted this to be a career. Now I’m terrified and I don’t know what to do. I’m losing sleep, I’m scared to go to work for what environment I’ll walk into while he is there.

Ethics advice - severely disabled patient,"I am looking for some insight from some senior docs on this issue.

Recently on our ward, a young man (20's) was admitted with pneumonia. He is a spastic quadriplegic with microcephaly and cerebral palsy, non-verbal, feeding tube, incontinent with frequent seizures and requires 24hr care when at home. He cannot communicate in any meaningful way.

If we did not intervene with his medical issues that caused his admission he would have likely died. The family normally looks after him and he is for active treatment but not CPR/Intubation.

Introducing /r/JuniorDoctorsUK a sub for UK doctors to talk.,"Hello /r/Medicine

Medical training in the UK is different from most places on earth. It requires frequent relocations, applications, exams and interviews, multiple memberships with different bodies and it is much longer than other places with many of us being ""Junior Doctors"" sometimes for 15 years post-qualification.
The UK is also currently in massive political turmoil affecting many doctors, between the new Junior Doctor contract, the looming Brexit, progressive NHS privatization, and Junior Doctors being struck off.

For all those reasons and many others, Doctors in the UK need a place to talk.
Facebook used to be this place. But with lack of anonymity and frequent reports of GMC investigations over seemingly benign Facebook posts, we need a new home.

**Introducing /r/JuniorDoctorsUK**

A place where doctors can share:


* Their workplace experience.

* Career progression and applications advice.

* Opinions on policies that affect their working lives.

* Interesting research and audits.

* Opportunities.

* Funny and relatable posts.

* or anything else...

I also hope for/r/JuniorDoctorsUK to become a sort of crowd-sourced ultimate resource for people in our profession with our growing [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JuniorDoctorsUK/wiki/index) that is/will be covering aspects specific to our lives nowhere to be found online. 
I also expect that new opportunities will be created (nation-wide research/audits, multi-center collaborations, community projects/research/polls etc..), and that long lasting change will start here (policies, frameworks, ideas..).


This subreddit is brand new and mostly empty, and UK doctors are notoriously rare on reddit and shy online, for fear of repercussions. Please consider joining and spreading the word to your colleagues to help our community grow and make its way online to a place we can express ourselves freely, and turn it into something awesome.

Hey, if you’re not a doctor, or not from the UK you’re more than welcome to join us, share your opinions, or ask questions! 

PS: I have gotten Mod approval before posting here

tl;dr: UK doctors need a place to talk.

"Labwork recommended and done by pharmacy, wanted my interpretation","After seeing a new patient for an acute complaint I ask if there’s anything else I can help them with, they break out a print off of some lab results.

This is not something I routinely (or have ever) checked in a patient, but I asked why they were concerned with this lab work.

This was the first situation I’ve ever heard of like this, is this something anyone has dealt with?  


I advised the patient to be cautious with homeopathic remedies and told her the lab work recommended by the pharmacist was not something I would routinely check for a patient with a complaint of fatigue.

Question regarding what is typical of a practice,"This is from a throwaway account.

I'm a subspecialty ICU physician and started my first job in 8/2016.  I'm currently at the largest hospital in my state.  It's a private hospital.  It's on the east coast.

I'm frustrated because my colleagues are just lazy.  Physicians will typically leave the unit and likely the hospital after rounding very superficially.  APC's are frustrated as well as they're left to run an ICU.  I'm constantly playing clean-up...with families and with practicing medicine.  There is very little attempt to diagnose patients that require more than five minutes of thought, but more a push to support vital signs until they can be moved to our associate floor service.  Diltiazem gtt's are started because ""fast HR = dilt gtt"" rather than ever bothering to question what the rhythm is or if the pt is septic.  Relationships with pt's families are dismal and other physicians are generally annoyed by them - palliative care consults are usually placed to even have the discussion that a family member is going to die.  Other physicians would wait on the door from the parking lot into the hospital to tell me ""nothing new with anyone, goodbye!"" so they could leave faster and I would generally be greeted by frustrated nurses and chaos.

My concern is that I've spoken to multiple more experienced travel nurses and have been told that most private hospitals are some degree of this bad.  I went to a well-regarded residency and fellowship program and have options open...however, I don't want to get suckered into something again.  2/3rds of my shifts have been moved to the night shift - at first, I thought I was helping out because our unit director has meetings during the day, but later found it's because they're getting paid x2 for (poorly) covering our service #1 (primary) and #2 (stepdown, new pt's, outliers).  My spending habits haven't changed since fellowship.  Is this really true of other practices?  How do I spot poor places?  When I interviewed, where I'm at looked great.  Is there a way to fix the program I'm at?  I really like the rest of the hospital and am afraid I'll burn everyone else in my group by trying to fix this - which might be justified, but still I need to get a job somewhere else.  I love what I do, but it's getting hard to come into work because I get to start each shift with a couple hours of family updates after trying to fix what was missed during the day.  Our MD's are generally looked down upon by our surgical counterparts because others are not trustworthy.

I'm 35.  I want to plant myself somewhere that I and my family (I have kids) can grow and want to move as little as possible.  Does ""better"" than where I'm at exist?  How do I find out if it's really better?",medicine,1521970818,oground,14,51,True,2018-03-25

What do you think the most effective way physicians can advocate for change in society?,"As a medical student, this is something I struggle with. It seems to me that the most common ""attempt"" is posting on social media with an MD after your username.

Personally, I think both don't really do that much. I feel like physicians should be able to do much more.  

I am interested in people who have experience working in legislature, hospital administrations, etc. Any other ideas?

2) AED serum levels Yay or Nay?

4) Driving guidelines around the world? Do your epileptics have to notify driving authorities? How long do they have to stop driving with seizures?

"""direct"" speech after death of loved ones","a few weeks ago I had an interesting talk with the head of the icu (internal medicine) from my department about communication with relative after the death of a loved one.
the question comes  routinely from absolutely every relative every time
""did he/she have a peaceful death?"" or ""did he/she suffer?""
the attending who it seems is a big fan of buddhism and quotes buddha all the time and said that he is a big proponent of the concept of ""direct speech"", so more or less telling things how they are, bare of emotions and truthfully(no euphemisms etc.). but he said this is the only question where he says ""yes, he/she died peacfully in their sleep"" no matter how it really was.
this took me by surprise because like him or maybe even more, I always was unknowling a big proponent of direct speech and even took pride in being know for frank and authentic conversations with my patients.  but this conversation got me thinking. what good does it do especially in the described situation to tell them how it really was. it will change nothing for the dead patient who i want to be truthful for but everything for the relative.

Loop Diuretic Equivalencies,"I thought I understood the 1:20:40 ratio for loop diuretics (bumex,torsemide,furosemide), but after talking to my pharmacy I'm confused.

I would like to have a civil discussion about chiropractic care,"I am currently a student in a DC program. I do not attend a school that focuses on the ""philosophy"" aspect of chiropractic but rather backs up everything that is taught with evidence backed research. Of my current 11 classes, only one is concerned with manipulation technique. The others are basic sciences such as med micro, nutritional biochem, evaluation and management classes, neuroendocrinology, etc. We are taught CMTs in a very realistic fashion. We are taught the risks, the skepticism, etc. We are made aware that, although anecdotal, CMTs help with specific issues (MSK mainly) and do not restore immune function, mental clarity, increase various organ function, etc. And although it isn't specifically taught at school, I personally believe that, as with most treatment modalities, manipulations should be used in conjunction with other methods and only when necessary. They are not the be all end all. I am not against traditional Western medicine at all and in fact, the purpose of this post is to have an open, honest and civil discussion about how someone like me, once in practice, can have healthy relationships with the MDs, surgeons, etc in my area. 

Personally, I am interested in the treatment of MSK issues. I do not like the idea that chiropractors only treat LBP, only adjust, etc. I believe, assuming any major disease process is ruled out, that most MSK pain can be alleviated via a combination of different modalities such as soft tissue work, determining muscle imbalances, proprioceptive training, retraining neural-muscle patterns and other bio-mechanical work. Also, this is assuming that other options have been deemed unnecessary. If my patient has a herniated disc that is severely restricting their ADLs and it has been getting worse, I'm not against the idea of spinal surgery. Although this may be an unpopular opinion, I have personal experience with relief from these methods and would like to help others as well through these accessible and non-invasive methods. 

In your experience, how are ways in which I can create strong relationships with other medical professionals outside of my field? What is the general attitude towards the opinions I have shared above? My goal is to have a type of relationship with doctors where I can co-manage their patient if it is within my scope. I won't tell them to stop taking their medications, they won't show up at your office next time having a stroke or taking some foreign, not approved homeopathic supplement. I know it's an uphill battle but I am not looking for someone to tell me to change potential professions or to tell me what a mistake I've made. I am confident in my decision and am confident that, at least in my small circle, I can change the perception of what a chiropractor can be. I want to work with and learn from other medical professionals, not alienate myself. 

EDIT: Well from what I've gathered so far, it seems I need to discover a way to separate myself from a PT. Thanks for all of your input, good or bad. It helps me better myself.

EDIT: Another question I pose. All things being equal, a competent chiro vs a competent PT. We both deal with MSK issues. We both do movement/gait analysis, understand fascial chains, etc. Do you send to the PT just because it's what you're used to? That seems to be the only thing standing between me and the PT, the norm of sending to a PT.

Sternal rub in clinical practice - do we still use it?,"I recently completed an internal training course at my hospital on falls which covered how to correctly do a GCS; one of the biggest surprises I heard was that sternal rub has been strongly discouraged since the 1970s! Luckily for me I always opted for the trap squeeze in clinical practice.

The GCS website confirms this (http://www.glasgowcomascale.org/whats-new/), but not how long this recommendation has been in place.

Therefore I was hoping someone might know:

1. How long has this been the case? i.e. is it really a recommendation from the 1970s?
2. Is there another indication to use sternal rub? i.e. GCS is for assessing consciousness but is sternal rub for actively trying to wake someone from a reduced consciousness?

What prompted this question was a case of middle aged woman coming in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, wbc 27k, esr 109 and crp 340 with circumferential deep red/purple fairly well demarcated cellulitis of the distal LE associated with some small areas of blistering with id say mod-sev ttp in some areas on my exam. This seemed appropriate to me to image but i received some pushback. Ultimately was severe cellulitis with some superficial myofascial edema so great for the patient that wasn’t necrotizing, but made me question my judgement.

PSA: contaminated spice (synthetic cannabinoids) originating in Chicago,"In short, there's been an outbreak of contaminated spice originating in Chicago. It appears to have been adulterated with brodifacoum, which is a super-long-acting warfarin-like anticoagulant previously used as rat poison. As you might expect, it can cause severe, life-threatening bleeding and death if not treated promptly. It can be treated with vitamin K, though often requires between 40-100mg/day (or more) to keep INR &lt;2. There are 16 probable cases and one confirmed case in Chicago so far, as well as at least two related cases in central Indiana.

Unfortunately, we don't know the culprit product yet, how/where/when it got into the drug supply, or how widespread it is. Anyone who has used a synthetic cannabinoid in the past couple weeks or so is potentially at risk and needs an INR check to rule out exposure. If you happen to come across a patient who might have been exposed, please call Poison Control (800-222-1222) for recommendations and to help track the outbreak.",medicine,1522344392,taRxheel,73,465,True,2018-03-29

Best Practice Question Regarding Catholicism and Contraception,"Hi r/medicine

I am a registrar in my first year of family medicine training. For  training I am placed in a family/general practice clinic and learn by seeing patients on on my own. 

The clinic I have been placed in for my first run is owned by a group of Catholics. Catholicism is a minority group in my country and more than 50% of my country are non-Christians. These Catholics practice conscientious objection when it comes to terminations of pregnancy and contraception which essentially means they will not prescribe, provide or refer their patients for these things, but legally must provide a phone number address or name of somewhere that does to the patient.

On my first day I was told of these rules and that I am required to follow them. Ok I thought, their business, their rules. I will just keep my head down and try to learn as much as I can without complaining. However, a few weeks in I asked one of the owners who is also a clinician at the practice what I was to do for other illnesses where hormonal therapy was a treatment. I specifically referenced PCOS, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and acne. I was told that I cannot provide hormones for these illnesses and must use the alternative treatments that are available (eg. weight loss and metformin for PCOS.)

I was hoping to get some more perspective on this because it doesn't quite sit right with me. My usual thoughts with regards to treating illness is to use therapies based on the best evidence available and provided the patient is fully informed and accepting of the treatment.

What are your thoughts on this? I have tried asking my program supervisors and they had nothing to say on the matter so I would appreciate some perspective. Thanks!

My name is Emma, and I'm a reporter for Bloomberg News. I'm a part of a team here that's spending a year telling the stories of people who lack health insurance. We published a story on this today here: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-04-03/what-it-s-like-living-without-health-insurance-in-america

If you have an experience you'd like us to consider -- maybe you have health insurance but can't use it, were dropped from your plan or simply decided it was too expensive -- we'd like to hear from you. I'm posting here because we've already heard from a lot of people working in the medical profession who are either in contracted positions and weren't offered benefits or couldn't afford insurance because they're paying off loans. If you're interested, you can email me at eockerman@bloomberg.net or PM me and I'll explain more about the series.

- All IV Narcotics (Morphine, Dilaudid, Fentanyl): This one doesnt irritate me as much but some people really need IV opiates, i can get around it by giving through a PCA (that formulation isn't on shortage?) but that is clunky
- 1/2 Normal Saline and 500cc bags of NS
- Sodium Bicarb: we've gotten around this by using Sodium Acetate with the nephrologist's blessing 
- IV Zofran: we can only use ODT version now

Therapeutic milieu beyond psychiatry,"Unprompted musings.

Psychiatry has a long and not always fruitful relationship with the idea of the therapeutic milieu—that the environment and interactions with patients and staff can be part of treatment. I think in practice it's mostly given lip service and too many psych units are grim, hostile, frightening places, while patients face demands that they go out and interact and participate in sometimes stultifying group activities for no clear benefit.

That said, in better units, I think having things to do during the day, space to interact, and a chance (and expectation) to be out of your room helps maintain some kind of normalcy and humanity in the easily dehumanizing environment of the hospital.

Outside of psychiatry, in some ways there are fewer barriers. The patients are, in general, more likely to be able to interact appropriately. They're physically sicker, true, but for all the encouragement of OOB just going to the chair is not very stimulating; having some space for patients to go, just as a lounge or social space, would probably be comfortable and might also help maintain separation of day and night with reduction in delirium. And getting up and moving is also good DVT prophylaxis.

Of course there are obstacles. Practically, hospitals don't have this space available, nor is anyone likely to pay for it. Patients leaving their rooms, and potentially even their units, means that if the primary or consulting teams want to drop in they might have to figure out where the patient went. It's not obvious that patients would want to interact; wanting privacy and quiet for illness is common. Making hospitals too comfortable and friendly is, sadly, even more incentive for the already heavy burden of malingerers/overutilizers. But as a pipe dream, I think it might help hospitals be more hospitable.",medicine,1522801948,PokeTheVeil,10,12,True,2018-04-03

Does family medicine have a future in the US?,"As anything more than a niche luxury, similar to an attorney on retainer. I once had a highly successful ophthamologist whom I rotated with my senior year of residency, who named his clinic after himself, bark at me, ""Defend your chosen profession! I say technology is going to make the idea of one doctor who knows a little bit of everything absolutely laughable in 10-20y. I read journals from niche subspecialties of ophtho and can barely understand what they're talking about, for chrissakes.""

I actually wasn't fazed by this challenge and earned this bigshot's respect by not copping an attitude or crawling into a shell, but there are times if I wonder if he didn't have a point. I know that in many countries (Japan, for example) there are no outpatient primary care providers. One just goes directly to a specialist of the body system which is bothersome. In most of the developing world, a person only goes to see a doctor when something is so wrong that it can't be borne anymore. Isn't this *de facto* what the US is coming to have too? Will urgent care be the new primary care?

Edit: A few more details. Looking back on residency, I see now that the vast majority of my attendings were workaholics and bitterly unhappy, in their attempts to be all things to all people. I was regarded poorly by them for having the nerve to point out the elephant in the room that what they'd taken on for a workload was beyond what any sane and caring person should ever be asked to take on. Especially OB, which was a sacred cow in my program, and which my (again, sane) rejection of lost me a lot of points with the people evaluating me.",medicine,1522879171,hononononoh,90,67,True,2018-04-04

Is ASA necessary in Kawasaki?,"Per US medical school education and recommendations by AHA, AAFP etc....ASA should be used in Kawasaki.  However, I came across these (2 old, but 1 from 2013) articles that seemed well done, which suggest ASA is of no/limited benefit and ASA could potentially be more cost than benefit...or that IVG dosing is the thing that matters most.

If I'm understanding AHA recs (https://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1141.html) there is variation in US practice re: dosing of ASA....but no one eliminates it completely.  One article mentioned ASA being helpful for the fever...but if that's the only issue why not use acetaminophen?

What are your favorite medical blunders?,"I am consistently amused at how wrong medicine has been over the years. And not only how wrong we are, but how confident we are in our wrong-ness. Our hubris knows no bounds. 

My examples:

1. Tobacco smoke enemas of the 1700's. This is so ridiculous that it's almost hard to believe. Medical professionals of the time thought that blowing tobacco smoke into the rectum could resuscitate drowning victims.  They actually lined The River Thames in England with tobacco enema kits in the same way we line society with AEDs today. 

2. A more modern example - blood sugar control in the ICU. I vividly remember rotating through the surgical ICU as a medical student. It was terrifying. Malignant attendings and overworked, miserable residents gave me a sad glimpse into my immediate future. One memory that is burned into my brain is the daily tongue lashing the residents received because of the 'poor glucose control' of their patients. 

""Glucose needs to be below 110!!!""
""Increased mortality!!!""
""This is evidence based!!!""
(Van den Berghe Neurology 2005;64(8):1348)

Fast forward two years later. I, a young resident in the SICU, am fully prepared to be aggressive with my insulin. Only to find out....""oh yeah, we don't do that any more"".

""You mean... all that yelling during rounds two years ago was for nothing?""
""....pretty much""
(NICE SUGAR NEJM 360: 1283, 2009)

I often wonder what practices I currently have that will look absolutely incompetent 5, 10, or 100 years from now.

In the meantime.... Does anyone have any good examples of modern medicine getting in completely wrong? How have you seen medicine evolve throughout your careers?

I'm from the US. My aunt in Bombay is having medical treatment within my specialty. She does not understand her diagnosis and asked me to speak with her doctor by phone at her appointment.

Anyone regret choosing family over career?,"I'm an M2 trying to figure out what specialty to go into (we submit electives in a month or two), and I'm struggling to decide between surgery and a more lifestyle friendly/ geographically flexible specialty. 

I've spent a few months shadowing in the OR and I've really enjoyed it. I like the environment, I joking around with the attendings and staff, I like the cool tech and the anatomy. I also enjoy the idea of working with my hands, of mastering a skillset and of providing more definitive treatments. People have told me that I should really love surgery to go into it, but how am I supposed to know I love it if I won't be operating until deeper into residency?

I've always been a family oriented person and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer recently. The prognosis is fairly good, but this was still a wake up call as it got me thinking about my parents' mortality. Because of how competitive residency is, there's a good chance I'll have to move fairly far away. I know residency is only 5 years of my life (with a fellowship or two likely to follow due to job market in my country), but if you think about it, that could constitute a good part of the time I have left with my family. Complicating things is that my girlfriend of five years is geographically immobile, so if I do end up moving away that relationship may not work out. I know things get better as an attending, but I'm still not sure if the schedule would allow me to spend as much time with my loved ones as I would want. 

On the other hand there are specialties that are less competitive that have less intense residencies and a better lifestyle as attendings. I still find the work interesting, but it isn't as much fun, or as exciting as surgery is to me. Maybe the excitement fades over time, but I'm worried that I'll regret choosing 'the easier path'- seeing my friends doing something  they're really passionate about and having 'settled' myself.

Our Cardiologists are not telling Patients about Cardiac Rehab [Rant],"Hope everyone is doing well.  I apologize if I'm in the wrong subreddit-


Recent B.S Graduate here- moving Into exercise physiology and cardiac rehabilitation.  I posted something Similar in r/Cardiology, but had no luck.  I'm currently employed with an Outpatient therapy Center that is comprised of PT, OT, ATC, Fitness and Cardiac Rehab work.  I work primarily with the Cardiac Rehab dept.





Aside from Patient care, we are also in charge of receiving EMR orders, filing facesheets into the cardiac rehab database, etc.  After several weeks, we pull the patient information to call them to continue their care.





2 weeks after the recent cardiac event, we usually attempt to call the patient or family member to inform them that their cardiologist has faxed us a referral order for Cardiac Rehabilitation at our facility.  We just need to verify basic insurance, address, contact information, etc.  The majority of Insurance cover phase 2 at 85-100%






The problem I am facing is that the Cardiologists have not been informing these individuals about this referral to Cardiac Rehab.  No paperwork, no pamphlets, nothing. They are not informed upon discharge from the hospital or their two week follow up appt.  When we call them- we are often met with confusion(""My Dr. Never said anything..""), disinterest (""already had cath, i'm fine""), or simply hung up on.  Many potential patients have not heard a single word from their physician and believe we are random third party trying to solicit them for care (???).  We have a regular patient population coming in, but the amount of 'no responses' we receive is staggering.





This morning, speaking with a Cardiologist who comes to use our gym, stated that he does not have a clue about our cardiac program he is referring patients to because it is automated paperwork that goes thru to our dept upon  pt admission...




I have done my very best to inform individuals about the extreme value of Cardiac Rehab (statistics, prognosis, etc)  but it falls on deaf ears because it is coming from a stranger who has not met/treated them previously. I'm concerned about this disconnect between the doctor's office and our therapy clinic.   Is this common? Is this not the doctor's job? Maybe I just need to improve at it?



I'm wondering if anyone has had any prior experience with this, and how to improve this situation?  Part of me feels like it not the job of an Interventional Cardiology team to do this, but what we are doing now is simply not working..

Changing Perspectives on End of Life Care,"Currently on my ICU rotation in a regional academic center, and I would venture a guess that around 33% of patients who go to the ICU don't leave. 

My observation is that the majority of patient's families don't ever want to make the patient DNR DNI, as they do not understand the issues associated with that.

However, from seeing hundreds of patients here, I have realized that DNR should be utilized way more than DNI. Lots of people come back from being intubated, not so much from having CPR. 

Seeing a 100 year old lady get CPR is soul-crushing and makes me wish the family could see that happening. 

Maybe the USA should change its laws on end of life care? Can we automatically make people who are 80+ DNR, and then ask them about DNI separately at admission?

Financially speaking this would save billions as we have patients who sit in the ICU for months and months intubated and on tons of medicines because the family won't let them die, the ethicists won't let them die, and the lawyers won't let them die. 

In other countries, two physicians can determine if a patient's medical care is futile. Perhaps we need that in the USA?

Is this an accurate was to assess it? Most of the information out there about it is just how to tell a patient to position there hands, so I couldn't find a clear answer.

"Resident Physician Pay Increase to $100,000","I was wondering if it would be possible to get resident pay to the minimum of $100,000 a year per resident. 

My rationale is that nurse practitioners and physician assistants make around 120,000 salary every year. However the nurse practitioners and the physician assistants do not carry as many patients as a resident physician and oftentimes do not work as many hours. Resident Physicians work 80 hours minimum per week. In addition resident physicians have at least eight years of training prior to being resident Physicians. This includes four years of undergraduate work as well as four years of medical graduate work in addition to a gap year for a masters or a research year. 

NPs can get to the 120k NP salary within 4-5 years, 4 years if they get a BSN and 1 year for a masters-NP degree, many of which are now online programs that are completed while working and earning a nurses salary of around 60-80k. PAs go to school for 2 years and then are earning the 120k PA salary, however they often have a year of clinical volunteering prior to PA school. Physicians take at least 11 years minimum to get an attending level salary, 12 if they took a gap year for research.

Most Resident Physicians are paid around $50,000 a year and have significant educational loans that are averaging in the $300,000.

I firmly believe that Resident Physicians should at least make something comparable to a nurse practitioner or physician assistant.

This would also help to increase the amount of Physicians that would want to go into Primary Care as they could significantly pay off their debt while working as a resident physician. Other ideas include eliminating the bachelors degree requireme

"I need to get this off my chest, I feel like a terrible doctor","I am expecting damning replies because I did a terrible thing. I am posting this because I want to get it off my chest.

At 8pm, just outside my house, a person fell off their bike. A bystander knocked on the door, somehow knew that doctors live at my address and asked my housemate to ask me to see the person.

I was lying in bed, dozing off, having just eaten my dinner. The situation didn't sound grave (?sp) from my housemate's account and he asked me if he should tell them to call the ambulance. I agreed and told him to do that. 

He then told the person at our door that I (the doctor) told them to call the ambulance.

I have been a doctor for 18 months (25yo), so I am pretty junior (UK). At this moment, I felt a bit under pressure and panicked. I am currently working in a radiology rotation so there are no emergencies. I haven't had my emergency thinking hat on for a while. What if I have forgotten how to assess an acutely ill patient? What if I do something wrong? So I just thought it was best to get the paramedics along.

Almost immediately after the door closed, I asked my housemate if we knew if the person had hit his head or was even alive? He said he didn't know. So it was at that point that I did what I should've done to begin with - I left and tried my best to attend to the person.

At the moment, I'm very much filled with guilt. I feel so terrible that I didn't go out to see the person. What kind of doctor does that? Even if there is no good samaritan law, it's a basic human instinct to help someone else. 

I just really need to get this off my chest because it's making me feel really hateful towards myself.

ER ECG case #1,"Hey Meddit! I have browsed this reddit for awhile and generally keep to the comment section; however, today I have decided I would like to actually contribute to this sub more than just a drive-by comment. I found that I enjoy cases, and enjoy education; two things I find this sub to be frequently lacking. I specialize in emergency medicine, and if I had a subspecialty it would be in evaluating the emergent ECG. Being a simple guy who likes to stick to what he knows, I have decided to sporadically post interesting ECG cases I come across. As Ghandi said, ""Be the change you wish to see in your subreddit"". Please give me feedback, and let me know if this is something you all want me to continue.

CASE #1

You're working a very busy shift in your ER when you are asked by your Comm Tech to review an ECG that EMS is requesting cath lab activation for. They give a brief hx that the patient is a 40+ year old man with a hx of HTN who was found unresponsive at home. They state he was found to be hypotensive and demonstrating agonal respirations, so was intubated in the field and started on a dopamine drip. They request cath lab activation. ECG is linked below. What do you see? What do you do?

Is placebo effect as pervasive as we're taught?,"After looking at the Depression thread from yesterday, I was wondering about the effects of placebo. I read this paper a while ago, [Is the Placebo Powerless? — An Analysis of Clinical Trials Comparing Placebo with No Treatment](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200105243442106) which compared differences in 3-arm studies of experimental, placebo and no treatment and concluded that placebo had no powerful clinical effects after comparing response between placebo and no treatment in over 100 studies. 

I recently learned that this study was followed up by a [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15257721) and then a [cochrane review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554). The cochrane review found that in patient-reported outcomes, pain and nausea could be influenced by placebo. They wrote that depression was not significantly impacted by placebo which, I was surprised by. 

It seems from these studies that placebo does not matter, but I always hear about placebo in both layperson and medical lit. Am I missing something here?

"Filing taxes as a third year medical student, can I get some advice/help from newly graduated docs?","I'm not sure if this should be posted here or if it is more appropriate in another subreddit, but I remember reading a while back that it is worthwhile to file your taxes in third and fourth year to help take advantage of IBR plans for loans once you start residency. I can't find the post, but the logic was along the lines of since your previous year's income was $0, your loan payment was $0. The trouble is, I don't really know too much about filing my taxes, and when I tried last year, TurboTax wouldn't even let me because my income was technically $0. 

Do I need to file taxes this year to make sure I can take advantage of IBR once I start residency? Is this even a viable plan, or is it possible to just defer or make small payments? Do lenders expect me to start making payments once I start residency? Additionally, if I should file taxes this year to show that I have a $0 income, how do I do this?

31yo male with history of mild asthma and active tobacco use presented from OSH with 10d of worsening cough, fever, malaise, sob. Over the past 36hrs he developed pleurisy which prompted him to seek medical attention. He has never had these symptoms before, has no other known medical conditions, and does not take any medications. His CXR showed faint, hazy, nodular opacities throughout both lung fields.

Update, as I think u/brugada was on it.
Young guy worked housing construction, exposed to soil, dust. Has a healthy dog. No ther known exposures.

His serum blastomyces antigen was strongly positive and urine histo ag was weakly positive. I learned that the antigens cross react with the assays so simply based on these it is difficult to tease out which is which. He improved on ctx/azithro over his stay, which argues for acute histoplasmosis as this is a self limiting disease and usually improves on its own. He underwent CT head to screen for CNS disease if this were blasto, and this was normal. Histo and Blasto Igg and Igm are pending and ID plans to get serology ina  few months to hopefully confirm a diagnosis. He was started and sent home on po itraconazole.

"Dear Meddit, I am thinking of moving to another city for my career but my girlfriend is opposed to it- Really want some advice","Sorry if this comes off a bit like a /r/relationship post, but I wanted to get advice from other doctors who have been in similar positions as myself.

  I (26M) am currently finishing FY2 junior training in the UK, and I have applied for core medical training (CMT) (2 years long) with the intention of becoming an academic neurologist. Not sure if this is akin to the US system, but during 2 years of CMT, we rotate every 4-6 month to a different medical specialty so we get a diverse experience.

  Here's the thing, I reasoned that I needed to find a job that includes a neurology rotation if I were to specialise in it after CMT. where I am currently living in does not have a great deal of jobs with a neurology rotation ( I am living with my girlfriend right now), I will apply to them, but I expect they will be highly competitive because of their sparsity. This was when I realised, there is an abundance of neurology hospitals in London- every bloody hospital has a neurology department!! I can't help but thinking and wanting to work there, the heart of the UK and the centre of neurology, there will be plenty of research I could participate in as well, and the london universities and research facilities are one of the best in the world. I mean, who wouldn't be excited right?

  Anyways, heres the problem- my girlfriend is against moving to London at all costs, other places she may consider. This is the one place that she is 100% against, due to costs of living and her pre-conceived idea that she would not get along with any southeners. My gf is also a non-medic and she isn't career driven and she said that moving away from your partner for a career is an idea that is completely foreign to her. She is also v against LDR as she doesn't do well when we don't see each other regularly. Not only this, but she said if I were to move, she would not want to be with someone who does not prioritise their relationship above everything else.

Negative ROS/exam findings without doing them?,"Hi /r/medicine. I'm a bedside nurse and soon-to-be FNP. Over my time at the bedside and during clinical rotations with preceptors I have come upon a trend I'm trying to understand. Frequently I have seen physicians, NPs and PAs document negative ROS complaints without actually asking the patient, and negative physical exam findings that were clearly not assessed.

The obvious answer I have gotten my entire time in healthcare is to never document something I did not do, and I have stayed true to that so far. Yet this practice seems common. I have witnessed multiple people document normal TMs, benign abdomens, and nontender lymph nodes without touching the patient. I have seen many variations of, ""denies cough, fever, chills, SOB, CP, palpitations"" without asking the patient any of those questions. I am not trying to act holier than thou or question the ways of others, I just want to know what you all think about this practice.

SALT-ED and SMART Trials published today possibly ending the debate on balanced fluids vs saline,"The NEJM published both studies online today. 

[SMART Trial- Balanced Fluids versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711584?query=featured_home)

[SALT-ED Trial- Balanced Fluids versus Saline in Noncritically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711586?query=featured_home)

These are sister studies performed at Vanderbilt over a 16 month period. Patients were randomized based on the month they arrived to the ER. The SMART trial had a primary outcome of a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥200% of baseline). This composite outcome will undoubtedly be a point of contention from detractors, and I have to agree that I really do not like composite outcomes, especially when each individual component of the composite fails to meet statistical significance. Interestingly, however, the statistical significance of the SMART trials composite outcome seemed to primarily be driven by mortality. 

The SALT-ED trial strangely chose hospital free days as their primary outcome with major adverse kidney events being a secondary outcome. The trial failed at demonstrating a difference in primary outcome, but there was a significant difference in major adverse kidney events. 

Although I despise composite outcomes, I have to say that, for me, this is the final straw in the debate of saline vs balanced fluids. While some might argue that an NNT of something like 96, may not be clinically significant, the amount of fluids that are given in our ERs on a daily basis is enough for that NNT to be significant IMO.

"Those with close family in LTC, do you involve yourself in your their care?","I'm 25 now, and when I was 14 my father had a stroke that rendered his left side fully paralyzed. He's bedbound and has been in long-term care for the past 10 years.

As I grew up, our family was never quite involved in his care. Even as I studied pharmacy (with multiple LTC rotations and one palliative) and began practicing, I never thought to start involving myself. It was only yesterday that I found out he is in chronic pain which is managed by fentanyl patches. My dad is kind of a stoic, so I can see why he never voiced discomfort to our family during visits.

Being a pharmacist entails the presumption of competence in the HCPs around us, because we usually start our work without the full picture. If a patient is taking a drug without obvious indication, it means that *we the pharmacy* are probably not aware of the indication. Unusual drug choices are likely due to a specialist's expertise and particular minutia in the patient's specific case, rather than an incorrect choice.

I guess that's carried through with my father's case in that I have always assumed competence in his care team, and that it would be intrusive for me to involve myself. I've had experiences with families that like to direct care, so I know what's that like. However, I see now that the lack of involvement *also* means that I am probably missing a lot of information that is pertinent to me as his family, too. I've decided that I will attend his next care conference, where I will try my best to remain a spectator.

Whilst I understand that distributive shock is systemic and that the issue of distributive shock is the leaky blood vessels leading to reduced systemic vascular resistance and then reduced blood pressure and subsequent tissue perfusion, I was wondering how the body would actually be able to deal with that.

How do you keep going when you're just spent?,"I'm a fellow now eight months into my first year.  I had always planned to do this fellowship and was fortunate to match at a great institution.  However, I'm not really sure I can do this anymore.  This year is entirely clinical and I am essentially the only contact person for our service.  Which means I have to be constantly available and tied to my phone.  Additionally, they made changes in the fellowship after the first of the year that took away almost all of my admin time.  I still have the same responsibilities, just no time to do it--and thanks to an ancient EMR at one of our hospitals, these things can only be accomplished while on campus, yet I now spend most of my time at the other hospital.  Not to mention I'm the one that has to cover everyone's clinics when they're on vacation or at conferences, while still doing all the prep and follow-up for mine even the rare times I am away.  Etc., etc.

Not to mention I moved over 1000 miles away from all my family and friends to do this fellowship.

When I was in med school I was suspended for two weeks for what was deemed to be an unprofessional social media post. I am now finishing up intern year and filling out FCVS with the intention of applying for my state medical licensure come July (I intend on moonlighting). 

There is one question in FCVS that I feel I must answer “yes” to.  “Were you ever disciplined or placed under investigation?” The other questions are less relevant and if I stated yes it would be to disclose the same story. Once you click yes it asks for a reason. I am wondering if I would need to disclose more than the information I have given in this post. I’m also wondering what I should expect to happen as a result of disclosing this. 

As far as I know, the only place my school disclosed my disciplinary action was in my MMSE (it was a simple one liner, more simple than what I have disclosed in this post). So, I doubt anyone would know about my disciplinary action beyond what I choose to disclose. 

Would appreciate any help I can get. Thanks !",medicine,1520027494,debki,15,8,True,2018-03-02

"Tramadol, Tapentadol and Buprenorphine for acute pain","Hi Meddit,
Following on from this week's recent post about tramadol for chronic pain what is everyone's opinion on the use synthetic opioids in the treatment of acute pain especially post surgical pain? I've recently moved health systems and I'm finding that my current district uses the above drugs heavily often as first line agents in the place of other opiates such as morphine and Oxycodone (after regular paracetamol etc).

I feel like it is an unnecessary precaution. Your average attendee to the hospital isn't going to become addicted to prescription opioids from several days of Oxycodone post trauma or surgery. The seniors who I have spoken to attribute their choice as a decrease in undesirable side effects from morphine derivates.

To clarify I am referring to patients with no past history of opioid addiction, dependence, abuse etc.",medicine,1520067185,Fightmilk_inc,29,13,True,2018-03-03

Return of bowel function post open AAA repair,"I’m a nurse in a CVICU in the U.S. We have had a patient on our unit for almost 3 weeks now. She had an open AAA repair 2 weeks ago emergently and I have been instructed by the surgeon to keep the NGT to low continuous suction. She has bowel sounds (hypoactive) and is passing gas but the MD said we cannot remove the NGT or feed her until she has a bowel movement. 

This may be a stupid question but my fellow nurses and I are stumped on how the patient is supposed to have a BM if we are suctioning everything out of her stomach? I asked the surgeon myself but he gave me a lecture on how the bowel’s circulation gets cut off during the operation. I understand that.

Citing Resources like Dynamed or BMJ Best Practice vs Primary Literature?,"Curious to see what other healthcare providers thoughts are on this. I know my preceptors get mad (and for good reason) when you cite UpToDate as your main resource since it’s expert opinion and not always evidence-based.

But for tools like Dynamed and BMJ, the content is thoroughly vetted through a systematic process so that only high quality information makes its way into their articles/monographs.

I know for Dynamed specifically, they take the guidelines and condenses it down into bullet points. So I feel confident that if I cited Dynamed I know I’m essentially citing the guideline. I’m still becoming familiar with BMJ but it appears to be a refined version of UpToDate where it has a narrative, but the content is still sound (to my knowledge).

It seems to me that the easiest thing to do is to cite these resources as it has everything in one convenient spot. The only downside I perceive is that if you don’t have a subscription to the service, it doesn’t do you any good.

What is it that I’m missing about citing? Thank you for any insights!

EDIT: I didn’t make it clear but I am referring to presentations. Obviously in practice settings the guidelines should be your go to and these resources can be useful for quick reference. Primary resource is where you go most of the time though. ",medicine,1520200148,8RulesOfFightClub,16,6,True,2018-03-04

Alternative to Language Lines?,"Hi all,

I'm currently interning at my city's health department, and I have been tasked with the special project of finding an alternative to the language line we currently use. Here's the problem: Language Lines are pretty cost effective up-front, but they come at the price of time the provider (nurse/physician/medical professional) must spend dialing in, and we tend to see that patients are less likely to open up and truly share about their health problems with someone over the phone (I'm specifically thinking of our women's health and prenatal clinics). 

Obviously it would be ideal to hire someone full-time/part-time which would allow for a more holistic solution, but I was curious if anyone on here has come across any other potential alternatives.
