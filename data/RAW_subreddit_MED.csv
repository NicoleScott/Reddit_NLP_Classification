Two skinny, sunburnt legs stick out from a pair of much too large, frayed, hand-me-down cutoffs. Green grass stains cover the skin of both knees. His bare feet are filthy, farm boy filthy. The kind of filthy that comes from playing in the cool dirt of an old barn floor, from running through uncut fields of wheat alongside the combines, and from climbing the giant hay bales that dot the rolling hills this time of year.

Two hours ago he was just another shirtless boy in a cowboy hat playing in the wheat.

His mother stands across from me. She is perhaps thirty-two. She has sandy blonde hair, just like the boy on the gurney. I can’t see her face because it is buried in her husband’s chest. She is completely silent but her whole body shakes, trembling like an old John Deere combine with something stuck in its blades. Her husband pulls her tight, his arms wrapping around her, trying to protect her from this place, this moment.

The two of them clutch to each other, here, in my emergency room.

At the head of the bed the ventilator chimes and puffs and clicks along as it pushes air into the boy. It pushes air into lungs that collapsed and now have chest tubes draining them. Lungs that cried out just loud enough to stop thirty thousand pounds of combine from turning the boy into chaff with the wheat.

The boy’s arm twitches. The nurse next to me blinks back tears and adjusts his IV.

A case like this is a bomb that detonates in our ER, in our town, in our lives. The shockwaves right now are spreading as neighbors call neighbors, as friends call friends, as family reaches out for family and parents run to check on their children. I know I will not be the only one unable to sleep tonight.

The father stares at his son on the gurney. His face is filled with questions for which I have no answers. How can this happen? How can something we love, something so full of life, be so fragile, so vulnerable, so easily cut down and taken from us in the blink of an eye?

He does not know it yet but he is now standing in a new life. A life that will always be different from the one he woke up to this morning.

I step over to the computer to order some more sedation for the boy while we wait for the helicopter. Taped above the screen is a brand new sign. It is a decal of five gold stars. It seems so out of place at a moment like this. The last few weeks the hospital has been putting them up everywhere. They are there to remind us to give ‘five-star’ service- to tell our patients how much we appreciate their business and hope they will choose us for their future healthcare needs.

They are to be called customers now, not patients, we are told.

Customers.

I tear it off the screen and wrinkle it in my hand into a ball, squeezing it tight. I shove it in the pocket of my white coat.

Twenty-two minutes later the whine of the helicopter engine fills the air as it prepares for takeoff. I stand outside with the father, watching the big blades spin up to speed in the late August light. Inside the helicopter there is room enough for only one parent to go with the boy. One hundred and three miles away a pediatric ICU bed is waiting.

The helicopter lifts off and a cloud of late summer dust fills the air. The father does not move as the debris cloud swirls about his head. Instead, he stares at the window on the side of the helicopter, the dark outline of his son just visible to us both.

We watch the helicopter rise above the pad and rotate slowly. It climbs a little further, hesitates in the air, and then races off above the wheat fields, the grains below bowing from the thrust of its blades.

I take out the five-star decal from my pocket, unfolding it carefully. I tear it in two and press the larger half against the brick wall behind us. I scribble my home phone number on the back.

“Let me know,” I say.

The father takes the paper and nods, still staring at the shrinking outline of the helicopter. At last it disappears over the mountains in the distance. He turns to me but his eyes are empty now. He is already departing, already arriving at the next place. We shake hands and he walks slowly off to his truck. He’s got a long, quiet drive to the city ahead of him.

I look down at what’s left of the ripped up decal in my hand.

The image of the boy burns bright in my mind. I know I will carry this day with me for a very long time.

I make a fist, crumpling the decal.

I respectfully disagree with those who want us to call them customers, healthcare consumers, or business opportunities.

The people we care for are sons and daughters. Mothers and fathers. Husbands and wives. They are neighbors, friends, and sometimes even colleagues.

They are people like you and me in a moment of need.

They are patients.

*Addendum:*

When I wrote this I thought maybe a couple dozen people would want to discuss it. I had no idea it would blow up like this. A couple short points:

1. I really appreciate everyone's comments and insights- from the administrators, to the patients, to others in healthcare. I have learned a great deal just from reading your posts and I hope others have too. Those of you who share your insights and experiences with others are truly the best of reddit.

2. To those determined to find and dox the boy in the story I say this: You are welcome to keep trying but you won't find him. Out of respect for my patients and because of HIPAA I always change enough details of anything I write in a way that makes it impossible to find the individual while staying true to what happened. I will say the original patient who inspired this story several years ago ended up fine.

3. To those of you who asked if I have written anything else I wrote a book of short stories about being an ER doc in a small town. It's here if you are interested. http://goo.gl/7mzn2P

I fly frequently and last week I faced a very scary situation that I would like to share here. My actions helped save a life, I think.

The plane had started moving on runaway and we were just about to take off, when a kid started screaming 3 rows behind me. I assumed he was cranky about flying until suddenly I noticed the flight crew rushing past. She grabbed the child and started shouting, ""Is there a doctor on this flight?"" I stood up reflexively without even thinking ( part of me screaming this was a very bad idea) and she immediately dumped the kid in my lap. 

He was about 1 year old. I don't have much experience with such an young age. Actively seizing. Grand mal. Frothing secretions from his mouth. Chest not rising. My mind went perfectly blank for a couple of seconds. This was bad, very bad. In the background I could hear the mother screaming her head off about her baby dying.

Training kicked in fast. A crowd was rapidly building up, someone slapping him, someone else trying to open his mouth. I shouted at everyone to back off and told the air hostess to bring the medical kit and oxygen asap. We created a empty space for him and I put him in recovery position, removing any big objects in vicinity.

Now the problem arose. The air crew had no medical training and did not know the contents of their kit. There was no drug to stop his fits, no anti epileptics, no benzos or any sedative. Nothing to establish i.v. access with or anything I could give nasally or rectally. I had no means to stop his seizure. I briefly asked mother about any recent history of fever, any prior history of fits, any medical problem. Everything was normal so far. This was his first fit apparently. He had eaten 2 hours prior.

By this time they had brought oxygen cylinder and a mask which was useless as he wasn't breathing anyways. I had to take control of his airway as his fits were continuous and I was worried about hypoxia, aspiration or a cardiac arrest. There was nothing to control airway either. There was a neonatal ETT but no pediatric size laryngoscopes. A small miracle happened and someone brought a AMBU and mask, all adult sizes. They actually had nothing pediatric with them.

I stuffed gauze around the mask and started ventilating with AMBU. They had no suction or monitors either, not even a pulse ox. He had started developing peripheral cyanosis although it could be me imagining things in panic. I was trembling head to toe. He thankfully had a good pulse so far. I asked for a big roll of gauze and in between breaths, tried to mope up as much of his secretions as I could. They found a steth in the meanwhile. 

He stopped seizing after 5 mins. He still wasn't breathing. Not responding to pain either. I continued ventilation, trying to avoid hyperventilation, checking pulse intermittently. On auscultation I could tell he had aspirated a bit. I kept on mopping excess secretions. His cyanosis disappeared. After 10-15 mins he started breathing. Chest was rising again. I put a mask on him, covered him with a blanket and kept on rubbing his back to stimulate him. He still hadn't opened his eyes and wasn't responding to painful stimuli either.

In the meanwhile, another issue had arrived. This was a flight on way to USA. The cabin crew wanted to take off. The pilot came to speak with me, emphasizing how important it was to start on time as delay would cause a massive financial loss. I told him not to continue, in my professional opinion. I couldn't release an unconscious kid to them as I was scared of another fit and cardiac arrest. The family involved agreed to let me decide the plan of action.

30 mins after it started, he opened his eyes and started crying. I can't tell how relieved I was to hear that cry. The on ground pediatrician came after 45 mins. They attached monitors and his saturation was 96%. The pediatricrian agreed that my decision to stop the flight was the correct one. They took him in an ambulance to a nearby hospital. I was afraid they would come after me for stopping the flight and I was very relieved when he agreed with my decision. The family couldn't thank me enough.

I struggle with imposter syndrome a lot. I make mistakes often and I don't know everything. But when I left that flight as we landed eventually, I knew I had helped save that kid so apparently I am not entirely useless.

Thank you for reading this super long story. I have hid some details for the sake of anonymity. 😊 

Edit:  Couple of things. I look young. I am a female. I forgot my registration ID when they asked me( got registered 2 months ago). This happened in a developing country. Lastly, they didn't realize the danger that kid was in, until I explained how rapidly he could desaturate. This all could be why they were reluctant to stop initially.

P.S. - Shout out to /u/beansterkins for gilding me. Thank you. You rock 😍 ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a young doctor, recently graduated.

I couldn&amp;#39;t release an unconscious kid to them as I was scared of another fit and cardiac arrest. The family involved agreed to let me decide the plan of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30 mins after it started, he opened his eyes and started crying. I can&amp;#39;t tell how relieved I was to hear that cry. The on ground pediatrician came after 45 mins. They attached monitors and his saturation was 96%. The pediatricrian agreed that my decision to stop the flight was the correct one. They took him in an ambulance to a nearby hospital. I was afraid they would come after me for stopping the flight and I was very relieved when he agreed with my decision. The family couldn&amp;#39;t thank me enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with imposter syndrome a lot. I make mistakes often and I don&amp;#39;t know everything. But when I left that flight as we landed eventually, I knew I had helped save that kid so apparently I am not entirely useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this super long story. I have hid some details for the sake of anonymity. 😊 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:  Couple of things. I look young. I am a female. I forgot my registration ID when they asked me( got registered 2 months ago). This happened in a developing country. Lastly, they didn&amp;#39;t realize the danger that kid was in, until I explained how rapidly he could desaturate. This all could be why they were reluctant to stop initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. - Shout out to &lt;a href=""/u/beansterkins""&gt;/u/beansterkins&lt;/a&gt; for gilding me. Thank you. You rock 😍 &lt;/p&gt;

I don't normally post for stuff like this, but my overnight shift last night shook me up a little bit, and still trying to process the couple of near-misses that I had.  First a little background.  I work at a medium-sized community hospital in a pretty large health system.  I'm on a little stretch of overnights right now.  They're really hit or miss at our hospital, since you have single physician coverage for most of the night.  You can have absolutely terrible ones where you start off bad and never catch up (as in you might not clear the waiting room until like 5 AM), or you might never really have more than like 4 or 5 patients in the ED after midnight.  So I guess that isn't too unusual for overnight shifts in the ED, but it just seemed like in residency there wasn't quite as much variation.

I'm a smidge over 2.5 years out of residency.  I firmly believe that an EM physician who thinks that they have it ""figured out"" is dangerously close to missing something, given the random crap that we see and deal with on a daily basis, but at the same time, I've seen quite a bit in my short career, and I think that I can handle the vast majority of what comes through the door without too much trouble.  Anyways, on to last night.My  last shift started out beautiful.  The first couple of hours were pretty light.  People to see, but nothing too bad to deal with, and we had empty beds in both the ED and the hospital.  It slowed down as the night went on, as it normally will do, and I was looking forward to a pretty decent shift overall.  Then I had two patients that kind of shook me.

The first one was an older guy who came in for chest pain.  Nothing too unusual, see it all the time.  Within like a minute I knew I was going to be admitting him.  The pain was in the chest, went up to his neck.  No dyspnea, some on/off nausea, no diaphoresis.  EKG looked completely normal.  Something just felt a smidge off, but I didn't think too much of it.  He had come in on oxygen from EMS, though it wasn't immediately obvious why.  I took it off of him, and his oxygen right after was like 95%, so I didn't think too much of it.  A couple of minutes later he was 93% on room air, and something still just felt weird.  I couldn't quite tell what it was, and I didn't really know why, but I thought heck, maybe he has a PE.  Worked a somewhat sedentary job, pulse ox a little lower than I'd expect.  I actually hate d-dimers, and think they're over-ordered.  If you're worried about a PE in someone who isn't young, I've always thought just scan them (criticize if you want, but that's not the purpose of the post).  So I scan him.  Blood pressure drifts down a little beforehand, but nothing too low.  On a whim I go over like a minute after he did to CT.  I walk in the room as he's getting the contrast for his CTA chest to rule out PE.  And boom, right there is a huge dissection.  CT tech and I just look at each other like holy crap.  Call the flagship hospital (my shop doesn't have CT surgery), fly him up there for emergency surgery.  His vitals got a little worse prior to flying out, so I probably would have scanned him eventually, but I didn't have a great reason to do it earlier.  Shook me a little bit how lucky I got.

While I'm arranging transport for that patient, a trauma patient came in.  Young guy, single-vehicle MVC rollover.  Complaining of a headache and not much else.  I evaluate him, order CT head, c-spine, and chest/abdomen/pelvis.  The only reason for the chest/abdomen/pelvis was the mechanism.  Has a small laceration to the scalp, bleeding a little but not that much.  CT scans show only a facial fracture.  He hadn't really complained of facial pain or tenderness, so I think that's a little weird.  I'm about to go suture his lac when I think to myself ""you know, maybe just scan his facial bones to make sure there isn't another fracture, the CT head doesn't get the whole face"".  So I send him back to CT.  He comes back, and I go in the room to suture the lac.  My phone goes off while I'm gloved up and about to suture, so I have a tech come in to get the phone out of my pocket.  It had actually gone off three times, the first two there was nobody in the room, and they got it for the third call.  They held the phone up to my ear, and radiology is now telling me that there is an epidural hematoma that they picked up on the facial bones CT.  I call the flagship hospital - we don't have neurosurgery at my shop - and fly him up there.  Fortunately GCS 15 and neuro exam normal upon transfer.

Basically radiology missed the epidural on the CT head.  It wasn't big, but it was there when you go back and look.  I hadn't looked at the images yet - I usually do before discharge - but I could have easily missed it scrolling through fast.  My CT tech - who is VERY good about picking up stuff like that in real time...unofficially of course - didn't see it.  It was the same radiologist that read both the CT head and then the later CT facial bones.  I'm shaking a little thinking that if I hadn't ordered that second CT, this kid would have gone home, fallen asleep, and died.  I know that I've missed stuff.  We all do.  But damn did that one hit home, and I'm not entirely sure why.  I think it was just how close I was to sending that kid home.

Anyways, I apologize for the long post.  Like I said, I don't normally post like this, but I'm just trying to process this.

Edit: As I'm reading through this again, I should give some credit to my nurse for the first patient.  They're the first one who mentioned PE.  In my mind, I initially downplayed it, then came around as I thought about it over the next minute in the room.  Apologies for making it seem like I originally had the idea before.  Not intentional, just tired.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance here.

It was the third week of my PGY2 year, so the term ""neurologist"" applied to me only loosely at best. So I barely knew what to do when I got the call that this gentleman and his wife had shown up on our floor, at 3am, with ""like 5 lbs of documentation (1).""

This is known to happen at this particular hospital from time to time. We're a tertiary referral facility, and there's often a backlog of weird cases awaiting transport once some logistical issues or other gets ironed out. I only learned this later, though; when I asked him what had changed or compelled the transfer, he just shrugged and said ""Nothing. Nothing's changed. That's the problem, man."" 

Fair enough.

Between what he and his wife told me, and also the forest-killing amount of paperwork he'd arrived with, I gathered that Jim had been having an increasingly rough time for the last 2 years. He showed me pictures of himself on his phone: he'd been tall, with close cropped, grey hair and softail Harley. His first symptom had been a bit of foot weakness, which he'd happily ignored until he wasn't able to upshift anymore. His last ride had been a puzzled, pissed off, 50 yard idle. His wife hadn't minded much, as she'd been a lukewarm fan of the bike at best, even before they got married. But his problems progressed, and since then, he'd been sliding slowly downhill despite regular IVIG infusions for his ""refractory CIDP.""

You know where this is going: when I met him, he was a flaccid mess of mixed reflexes and twitches you could spot from the doorway. His voice was only a little slurred and he wasn't having too much trouble with chewing or swallowing. Limb-onset ALS is like that. Luckily, his left arm was still working fairly well at the time, and so he used it to put on a pair of sunglasses at the end of the exam.

""Is it, um, too bright in here?"" I asked. 

""Yeah."" So I flicked off the lights for him. When I turned around, though, he was still wearing them. 

""Is it *still* too bright?"" I asked. It was the wee hours of the am, and his blinds were shut to boot.


After a long beat, he replied, ""Nah, man. I just like to look cool."" He was grinning his ass off. 

Maybe he caught me by surprise, or it was his delivery, or it was just the 4 am giggles, but I laughed long and hard. I couldn't help it, I liked him - which clinched the diagnosis, of course. I'd learned early in my intern year that niceness is something of a risk factor. In fact, I was reasonably sure that it was ALS at the end of our first encounter, but I didn't say anything. I was just starting my training, after all, and barely knew what the hell I was talking about half the time (2). It didn't seem appropriate to give him a diagnosis like that, on my own, in the middle of the night. There were lots of good reasons not to say anything right then. But if I'm being honest now, part of my hesitation also stemmed just a bit from fear of telling *that* on my own - which is understandable, but it's not something I'm especially proud of. 

We told him the next morning, my attending and I. Or, rather, my attending did an excellent job of laying everything out, while I stood behind and slightly to the right, still floating in that peculiar, nigh-hungover, post-call limbo that all younger residents live in for a little while before they get the hang of things. Towards the end of the conversation, Jim asked me directly, ""Is that what you think, too? ALS?""

""That's what I think,"" I told him, which just made him sigh heavily. 

Out of all the ways he could have handled the news - screaming, wailing, a stoic ""I see,"" - his response was to look at his wife, and to tell her that he loved her. I still remember it. I'd find out later that they'd been married for 18 years at the time of his diagnosis. We did the only useful thing you can do at a time like that, and quietly stepped out.

****

He wasn't a patient that I followed regularly. He wasn't in my clinic or anything, and so it was a little surprising how often we ran into one another. I caught up with him perhaps half a year later, while doing a neuromuscular clinic rotation. Right off the bat, he asked me how I was doing and whether I'd cried after diagnosing him. He had his son with him that time, and they had a good laugh about it/me.

""He looked like a girl after watching one of that guy's movies. You know, that guy?"" he asked.

""Nick Sparks,"" his son said, a little too quickly.

""Yeah, like a Nick Sparks movie!""

I tried to interject here, but nobody wanted to hear that I hadn't cried. He did, however, want me to help him appeal to insurance to cover a hand-controlled, electric shifter so that he could ride again. Which I couldn't, of course. Shifter or not, he wouldn't have been able to balance to save his life, and he only had one working arm. 

After hearing me out, he gave me that same, heavy sigh.""All right then, Nick. What else you got for me?"" 

Obviously, I didn't have much. With a diagnosis like ALS, nobody does. And I can tell you, going from handicapped motorcycle aids to talking about advanced directives is.... not the easiest transition. But he was very reasonable, and answered all my questions. He let my medical students examine him, to see what relatively advanced ALS looked like.

But he very gleefully called me Nick the whole time. Which isn't my name, as it turns out. It doesn't even share any of the same letters. So as you can imagine, he kept it up for the next few years, and it never failed to confuse the hell out of any students or attendings I happened to be with.

****

It carried on like that: random, unscheduled encounters as his symptoms slowly progressed. 

I'd see him again in our multidisciplinary ALS clinic from time to time. I saw him once in the hospital, when he came in for a wound on his leg that had become infected; his primary team consulted us and we didn't have much to offer. 

Towards the beginning of my PGY4 year, I actually ran into him and his wife in our hospital's cafeteria. His voice was much more slurred by that point. He had a PEG in place, and he was reclining in a powerchair. His wife and I split a turkey burger while he slowly worked on a massive milkshake ""with a doubleshot of Boost."" At one point, I stole his sunglasses out of his shirt pocket, which left him mildly outraged.

Putting them on, I asked him ""Who's cool now, Jim? *I'm* cool. I'm David Bowie. I'm Freddie Mercury when he had a mustache (3).""

He laughed. He told me they looked terrible, and that I deserved to get run over by his wheelchair. He asked me when I - Nick Sparks, mind you - was going to produce my next chick flick. But I didn't take them off until I had to, when my pager sounded a stroke alert, and I had to leave in a rush.

****

That's the last time I saw Jim, but it wasn't the last time we were in touch. The front desk at our clinic got in touch with me a little while ago, and told me that I had a package. In my fellowship, I float between a few different sites. I don't have a dedicated clinic of my own, so there's no single place to keep things addressed to me. Unfortunately, in this case, it meant that my package had floated around for a few weeks, until a) somebody remembered/rediscovered it and b) I was back on service.

The note, which he'd dictated, read:

*Dear Nick,*

*I hope you're doing well. I heard you had a little girl, which is great news! This is for her. If you don't have a name yet, name her Jim. Not James, that's too formal.*

*I'm off to hospice like we talked about. I think it's time. It's going to be ok so don't worry about me. Thanks for everything!*

*Best of luck,*

*Jim*

Included was a small bear, with a pink ribbon around it's neck and a paisely pattern on all four paws. My daughter hadn't even been born the last time I'd seen him. I think he knew my wife was pregnant, but that was about it. He must have asked around about me.

Maybe this time I *did* cry, though I really tried not to. I found a quiet corner, and I probably looked very ugly, which I think Jim would have liked (4). 

****

I called his wife a few days ago, who's doing well enough, and who I think was happy to hear from me. He hadn't lasted very long after going to hospice. I guess he knew. I gave the bear to my daughter, and it's just another one of her stuffed animals now. She's 19 months, after all. 

I know patients die, but this one's different. This wasn't a medical mystery, or a cautionary tale. I didn't lose him. And it's not neccessarily tragic - it's just the story of this funny, great guy who managed to stay funny and stay great, even after he was handed a death sentence. He loved his wife and he missed the road. From the beginning of my PGY2 year, he saw me grow up, in a way. He became part of my personal history and we shared some laughs.

He was the patient that did at least as much for me as I did for him. Sometimes, people are amazing.

I struggled with whether or not to write this, if it's not appropriate please let me know. 

I've been an RN for 5 years, medical/oncology as a charge nurse and a travel nurse for the last 1.5. As a result I've interacted with many residents and many many nurses. I know that dealing with nursing is a fairly small part of your day to day, but I thought I'd share some tips and tricks that might help things go smoother and maybe make your lives a little easier. This is likely going to be quite long. 

Quick primer for those with minimal hospital experience:

**CNA/nurse assistant/nurse aide**: can get vital signs, can record I/O, has very minimal to no medical training, though this varies some by state. Are the ones who typically walk patients, take them to the bathroom, turn and change them, etc. are very likely afraid of you and can be as young as 16.  


**unit clerk** sits at the front desk,  smiles at you, probably in business casual. Can get ahold of anyone at any time, and knows which nurse has which patient. Good ones know which doctors from which service are on that day, what time everyone goes home, after hours pagers, when other docs typically round. A good clerk could get you on a conference call with the derm attending on Christmas Eve and Jesus.  


**floor nurse** either an LPN, or an associates/bachelors prepared RN.  Important note, hospitals have pretty much phased out hiring LPNs and grandfathered in the ones who were working when the switch was made. Consequently most LPNs are 170 years old and phenomenal nurses. Don't let the lesser education fool you. They also tend to be sassy in a Laverne from scrubs way. 


**charge nurse** almost always an RN with a couple of years experience at a minimum.  Typically has a specialty certification related to the unit they are on. Typically don't have patients of their own, though sometimes they do. Charge nurses handle emergencies, know a little bit about all of the floor's patients, act as a resource, handle all the weird stuff that comes up etc. this nurse is undoubtedly money under pressure and you can likely count on him or her to be competent and know their stuff. 

**everyone says to suck up to nurses or they will make my life miserable** I can honestly say I have never seen this in my time as a nurse all over the country. I'm sure it happens, my apologies if it does, and you should pursue the proper channels if nurses are doing something to hinder patient care. The truth is we tend to get a little grumpy when a new team takes over because our jobs are really really busy. Administration has cut our staffing to the ragged edge and so any changes disrupt our flow. Just a couple weeks ago I had a patient where a resident ordered a CTA to r/o PE and wrote in her note that it was really important to get the results asap. Unfortunately she put it in for routine instead of stat because while she was putting in the orders someone had gotten ahold of CT and they said they could do it right then. At our facility this means that a radiologist won't read it until the morning because it was put in after 7pm and as routine. I didn't catch this until 10pm when I was reading the note so I had to call her at 10pm and get it all sorted out which took multiple phone calls and time. It's not her fault, it's an idiosyncrasy of the hospital, and impossible to know unless it's come up before, or you spend your down time reading policy and procedure. It's all little things like this that make life busier and can make us cranky. In 5 years of nursing there has only been one resident I've truly despised, and it's because she is a dick. Not a bad doctor or anything, just a genuinely unpleasant person.  I doubt she knows or cares I dislike her, and I've never done anything to cause her difficulty out of spite. If I like you however, I'll go out of my way to make your life easier. When I was a charge nurse for a 39 bed unit my favorite resident of all time was making small talk at the elevator and told me he was exhausted.  Knowing that I asked the 8 nurses I was in charge of to page me prior to paging him unless it was an emergency. I had a lot of new nurses on the floor at the time and I saved him a couple of 2am colace calls and other such nonsense, and managed to group pages so he wouldn't get bugged multiple times from my unit. That's not our policy or anything, but he went truly above and beyond for me once, so I was happy to try and help out (hope you got some sleep buddy).  If I disliked him, I wouldn't have told everyone to page him maliciously, I just wouldn't go though that extra effort for him.  That's the sort of thing nurses can do for you, but I'm not going to skip blood sugar checks because you're an asshole. 

**enough already! How do I make my life easier?** 
1.when you admit a patient, please try to put in basic prn's.  If it's appropriate, Tylenol, melatonin, zofran and colace will go a long way towards letting you sleep. I can do a lot of tap dancing with basic prns. 

2. Try to touch base with the nurse before you take off. I know this sometimes isn't doable, but it saves you time in the long run. I can tell you before you leave that the pt is super concerned about her discontinued multivitamin, or that she's not going to be able to stand for the X-ray or whatever and not have to page you later about something stupid when your brain is already 2 patients past her. If you can't find the nurse touching base with the charge nurse is a decent alternative. Otherwise don't worry about it, we get it if you have to run. 

3. If I call with something abnormal, give me parameters for when you want me to call back. If I call with a BP of 190/100 and you order 10mg if hydralazine, I'm going to have to call you back when it's 168/92. If you take the time to tell me ""if he drops below 170 systolic then You don't need to call me, day team can address better control in the morning. Keep an eye on it and let me know if he creeps over 170 again"" then you don't have to get woken up in an hour. Or if the pt has a 2.8s pause on tele and you say ""ok"" and hang up, you're really putting me in a tough spot. I can guess you don't care, but what if the next one is 3.7s? What if I don't call and he tanks? Good nurses are acutely aware that they are expenditures to the hospital while providers are revenue generating assets. We live in constant fear of being fired because we missed something important. Also our knowledge of medicine is largely algorithmic. We are a house built on stilts so to speak. So we may just be calling because we genuinely don't know how big a deal something novel is. A little background and parameters makes us breathe easier.  (My apologies to the resident I called 3 times when I was a new grad because he was running insulin and d5 at the same time. I figured it must have been an oversite). 

4. We don't expect you to know every nurses name on the floor, but it would be extra credit for you if you learned the charge nurses name on the floors you are on a lot. Saying ""hey Jeff, who has 340 today?"" Comes across so much better than standing on a chair in the nurses station and yelling ""who has 340?""  Plus knowing who the charge nurse is means you have a reliable nurse you know. There is a big gap in skill between the best and the worst nurses. If Jeff the charge nurse is very concerned about one of your patients, it would be wise to pay attention. I may not know the neurogenesis of vasovagal syncope but I've seen a lot of people get real sweaty and poop themselves unconscious, and I can kind of feel it coming now. Also just getting to know one familiar face can help. I was the only male on my last floor so I was the point of contact for many docs, we don't mind.

5. Ask us stuff! We know our floor inside and out. I can show you where the exam light switches are, how to move the bed around, how to make the IV stop screaming. I've got pockets full of stuff you can borrow, granola bars you can have, I picked a career that is all helping other people, I enjoy it.  Plus I enjoy the dichotomy of showing a brilliant neurosurgery resident how to use the automatic blood pressure cuff.  I know you aren't going to want my opinion on what antibiotic to use, but I can find you the only otoscope in the hospital.  Side note, if you take my stethoscope off of the unit I will find you and murder you. 

Finally, please don't assume I'm stupid because I'm not as educated as you are. I chose a career that lets me be in medicine, work 36 hours a week, that ends the second I walk out the door, and that lets me get paid to travel all over the country with my wonderful wife and really enjoy our 20s.  Yea I clean up poopies and I've shaved a couple dicks but I've got 4 years of reasonably difficult education and 5 years of significant clinical experience. If I call you gravely concerned about something at least hear me out.  Nurses are trained to not directly challenge physicians but to sort of supplicant around problems. ""Hey dumbass we can't give potassium IV push unless the electric chair is on the fritz"" becomes "" you know typically the pharmacy likes us to bolus potassium over a couple hours, it's their policy sorry but I wonder if we could change it from IV push?""  This needs to change, but nurses, especially old school ones or frightened new grads, are likely to rely on it.  

THANK YOU for taking the long hard road of physician training. The world needs you, and we are lucky to have you.  There are very few people who can do what you are doing.   Relax and breathe, it'll be ok. We are here to help however we can.  And remember your attendings and senior residents goof up all the time, like the one who ordered scd's on a bilateral BKA recently. Everyone's human. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=""/r/medicine""&gt;r/medicine&lt;/a&gt;. I struggled with whether or not to write this, if it&amp;#39;s not appropriate please let me know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been an RN for 5 years, medical/oncology as a charge nurse and a travel nurse for the last 1.5. As a result I&amp;#39;ve interacted with many residents and many many nurses. I know that dealing with nursing is a fairly small part of your day to day, but I thought I&amp;#39;d share some tips and tricks that might help things go smoother and maybe make your lives a little easier. This is likely going to be quite long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick primer for those with minimal hospital experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNA/nurse assistant/nurse aide&lt;/strong&gt;: can get vital signs, can record I/O, has very minimal to no medical training, though this varies some by state. Are the ones who typically walk patients, take them to the bathroom, turn and change them, etc. are very likely afraid of you and can be as young as 16.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unit clerk&lt;/strong&gt; sits at the front desk,  smiles at you, probably in business casual. Can get ahold of anyone at any time, and knows which nurse has which patient. Good ones know which doctors from which service are on that day, what time everyone goes home, after hours pagers, when other docs typically round. A good clerk could get you on a conference call with the derm attending on Christmas Eve and Jesus.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;floor nurse&lt;/strong&gt; either an LPN, or an associates/bachelors prepared RN.  Important note, hospitals have pretty much phased out hiring LPNs and grandfathered in the ones who were working when the switch was made. Consequently most LPNs are 170 years old and phenomenal nurses. Don&amp;#39;t let the lesser education fool you. They also tend to be sassy in a Laverne from scrubs way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;charge nurse&lt;/strong&gt; almost always an RN with a couple of years experience at a minimum.  Typically has a specialty certification related to the unit they are on. Typically don&amp;#39;t have patients of their own, though sometimes they do. Charge nurses handle emergencies, know a little bit about all of the floor&amp;#39;s patients, act as a resource, handle all the weird stuff that comes up etc. this nurse is undoubtedly money under pressure and you can likely count on him or her to be competent and know their stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;everyone says to suck up to nurses or they will make my life miserable&lt;/strong&gt; I can honestly say I have never seen this in my time as a nurse all over the country. I&amp;#39;m sure it happens, my apologies if it does, and you should pursue the proper channels if nurses are doing something to hinder patient care. The truth is we tend to get a little grumpy when a new team takes over because our jobs are really really busy. Administration has cut our staffing to the ragged edge and so any changes disrupt our flow. Just a couple weeks ago I had a patient where a resident ordered a CTA to r/o PE and wrote in her note that it was really important to get the results asap. Unfortunately she put it in for routine instead of stat because while she was putting in the orders someone had gotten ahold of CT and they said they could do it right then. At our facility this means that a radiologist won&amp;#39;t read it until the morning because it was put in after 7pm and as routine. I didn&amp;#39;t catch this until 10pm when I was reading the note so I had to call her at 10pm and get it all sorted out which took multiple phone calls and time. It&amp;#39;s not her fault, it&amp;#39;s an idiosyncrasy of the hospital, and impossible to know unless it&amp;#39;s come up before, or you spend your down time reading policy and procedure. It&amp;#39;s all little things like this that make life busier and can make us cranky. In 5 years of nursing there has only been one resident I&amp;#39;ve truly despised, and it&amp;#39;s because she is a dick. Not a bad doctor or anything, just a genuinely unpleasant person.  I doubt she knows or cares I dislike her, and I&amp;#39;ve never done anything to cause her difficulty out of spite. If I like you however, I&amp;#39;ll go out of my way to make your life easier.

Essentially, homeopathy is based on the belief that **like cures like**. In practice, this would mean that different symptoms would be treated using small amounts of substances that in bigger doses would cause them.

I do acknowledge that this ""like cures like"" principle has been scientifically researched, with the name **hormesis**. Because of these studies, it's widely accepted that a small amount of a substance can in some cases have a different effect on a cell than a higher dose. However, we don't know how rare this phenomenon is, and the alternate effect it causes isn't necessarily positive or desired at all. 

Practicioners of homeopathy generalize this very unclear and controversial theory by thinking anything that causes a symptom can cure it in low doses. For example, in 2018, naturopath and homeopathic practicioner Anke Zimmermann gave a 4-year-old boy a remedy containing the saliva of a rabid dog, to treat the boy's supposed anger management issues (which, by the way, are perfectly natural for children that age), aggression and poor sleep, claiming that the solution ""cured"" him. If the remedy actually contained the virus, this woman was literally endangering a child's life for some crazy pseudoscientific experiment, while probably charging the parents a significant sum of money for it.

Additionally, there is another, arguably even bigger problem with homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is produced using a method called ""potentization."" This means mixing 1 part of the desired ingredient with 9 parts of water, then shaking the solution, then mixing 1 part of the mixture with 9 parts of water again, and repeating this process over and over again. Homeopaths claim that the less of the ingredient the final solution contains, the more effective it is. This leads to the ingredients being diluted into nonexistence: in almost all homeopathic remedies, not a single molecule remains of the original ingredient. And even remedies that do have something else than water or alcohol in them only contain a couple of molecules of it: not enough to cause any effect. Again, none of this has been scientifically proven to work, but to be honest, homeopathic ""doctors"" don't seem to care about science anyway.


#Research on homeopathy

Most medical institutions around the world have rejected homeopathy as pseudoscientific nonsense, and rightfully so. In 2015, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council, one of the world's biggest and most respected health institutions, conducted a massive study on homeopathy, with over 1800 different studies systematically analyzing papers and documents related to the topic. They concluded that there was ""no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions.""
The NHMRC had already come to the same conclusion earlier, in 2014, when they found homeopathy to have no effect in treating any of the 68 different health conditions included in the study.
In 2010, BMJ (earlier known as the British Medical Journal) wrote an article proving that complementary medicines, such as homeopathy, are absolutely useless as substitutes for conventional medicine.
Even back in 2002, the British Pharmacological Society debunked homeopathy as completely ineffective.

These were only a few examples of the overwhelming majority of evidence clearly showing that homeopathy has no real curative powers. It's a fact at this point.

Most of, if not all of the ""evidence"" supporting homeopathy, however, is based on people's personal experiences. The problem with this is that these experiences originate from the subjective viewpoints of people who might be biased towards homeopathy, thinking it cured them for sure, when in reality there are tons of other possible reasons to someone recovering from a health condition. It could have been another treatment that was used alongside homeopathy that did the trick. It could have been a change of lifestyle. It could have simply been time: the human body fights for its health by itself. We all have powerful immune systems designed for keeping us alive and well.
Besides, what about all the people who didn't experience any help from homeopathy? We never see the homeopaths talk about them.

There is only one way homeopathic treatment could possibly help a human win over a disease or health condition: placebo. But it's an effect that applies to literally everything. You could eat a piece of candy, and believing in it enough, it could make you feel less ill. Funnily enough, that's basically what homeopathy is all about.


#Why it's unethical

Homeopathic doctors act like kind-hearted and helpful people, who embrace the idea of ""natural"" medicine as a way of healing for everyone. Some of them, I'm sure, truly believe their own lies. But this empathy is also a way to attract customers. Homeopathy is a big business, and a very greedy one.

These mixtures of water and alcohol are being sold to unsuspecting people as a risk-free, non-invasive cure to a plethora of different diseases/symptoms, usually as a liquid or in the form of small sugar pills. The problem with this is that even though they have no effect whatsoever, they are highly expensive, disguise themselves as real medicine and deceive people who often have chronic, painful, difficult, crippling diseases or conditions that they are desperately looking for relief for. The homeopathic industry not only lies to people and takes their money, it can even worsen public health by discouraging people from seeking help from proven, conventional medicine, guiding them towards homeopathy and other nonsensical alternative treatments instead. This is a true problem.


Lastly, I want to link you to a video about homeopathy made by a brilliant knowledge-spreading Youtube channel that some of you may have heard of: Kurzgesagt (In a nutshell). This video is what made me aware of the many flaws of homeopathy in the first place, and for that I'm endlessly thankful to the creators of it!

In 2015, Australia&amp;#39;s National Health and Medical Research Council, one of the world&amp;#39;s biggest and most respected health institutions, conducted a massive study on homeopathy, with over 1800 different studies systematically analyzing papers and documents related to the topic. They concluded that there was &amp;quot;no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions.&amp;quot;
The NHMRC had already come to the same conclusion earlier, in 2014, when they found homeopathy to have no effect in treating any of the 68 different health conditions included in the study.
In 2010, BMJ (earlier known as the British Medical Journal) wrote an article proving that complementary medicines, such as homeopathy, are absolutely useless as substitutes for conventional medicine.
Even back in 2002, the British Pharmacological Society debunked homeopathy as completely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BPS article 2002:
&lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874503/""&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874503/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were only a few examples of the overwhelming majority of evidence clearly showing that homeopathy has no real curative powers. It&amp;#39;s a fact at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of, if not all of the &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot; supporting homeopathy, however, is based on people&amp;#39;s personal experiences. The problem with this is that these experiences originate from the subjective viewpoints of people who might be biased towards homeopathy, thinking it cured them for sure, when in reality there are tons of other possible reasons to someone recovering from a health condition. It could have been another treatment that was used alongside homeopathy that did the trick. It could have been a change of lifestyle. It could have simply been time: the human body fights for its health by itself. We all have powerful immune systems designed for keeping us alive and well.
Besides, what about all the people who didn&amp;#39;t experience any help from homeopathy? We never see the homeopaths talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is only one way homeopathic treatment could possibly help a human win over a disease or health condition: placebo. But it&amp;#39;s an effect that applies to literally everything. You could eat a piece of candy, and believing in it enough, it could make you feel less ill. Funnily enough, that&amp;#39;s basically what homeopathy is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Why it&amp;#39;s unethical&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homeopathic doctors act like kind-hearted and helpful people, who embrace the idea of &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; medicine as a way of healing for everyone. Some of them, I&amp;#39;m sure, truly believe their own lies. But this empathy is also a way to attract customers. Homeopathy is a big business, and a very greedy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mixtures of water and alcohol are being sold to unsuspecting people as a risk-free, non-invasive cure to a plethora of different diseases/symptoms, usually as a liquid or in the form of small sugar pills. The problem with this is that even though they have no effect whatsoever, they are highly expensive, disguise themselves as real medicine and deceive people who often have chronic, painful, difficult, crippling diseases or conditions that they are desperately looking for relief for. The homeopathic industry not only lies to people and takes their money, it can even worsen public health by discouraging people from seeking help from proven, conventional medicine, guiding them towards homeopathy and other nonsensical alternative treatments instead. This is a true problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I want to link you to a video about homeopathy made by a brilliant knowledge-spreading Youtube channel that some of you may have heard of: Kurzgesagt (In a nutshell). This video is what made me aware of the many flaws of homeopathy in the first place, and for that I&amp;#39;m endlessly thankful to the creators of it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: just wanted to thank the strangers who gave me silver! Never expected anything like that from a post like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: wow, huge thanks to the redditor who gave me gold, I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier!&lt;/p&gt;

This young patient was one whom I held dear - I had seen them in the ED a few weeks ago, and inherited them when I got to the MICU.

To my patient who died today - I know you didn’t want to come into the hospital and you wanted to be able to go home if you could. I had hoped we could fix you up a bit so you could peacefully spend as much time as you could with your young spouse and kids. But we just couldn’t fix you enough; you were too sick.

Here you were, in the ICU when I got there, weeks after I had first met you. Each day was a battle of trying to titrate drips, interpreting new scans, trying to fix the vent settings, postulating what new test or procedure to do to maybe help you get better. Yet, nothing helped. We had some “good” days, where you’d get to be more awake, but there were so many more bad days than the good.

At the end of the day, I don’t think what we did medically really helped much at all. It ultimately just prolonged your suffering.

Honestly, I think the most healing I got to do was to know more about you, your life, your accomplishments, your dreams. Getting to celebrate you with your spouse was the most healing that was happening in that room. Letting you die comfortably with dignity was the best medicine I ultimately could give. 

Thank you for healing me. Thank you for trying to know more about me as well. It’s incredible that even while you were intubated, while you were in pain, you made the effort to write to ask about me. Thank you for lighting up when I told you I was a foodie and that I’d love to try your food one day. Thank you for blessing me with your friendship. Thank you for forgiving me for convincing you to come into the hospital.

For about two years I've been suffering from myalgia, anxiety, thirst, memory loss, confusion, dizziness and insomnia. This year I really struggled to stay awake during the day and when I started forgetting to feed my dogs, I decided it was time for a blood panel. There is was: hypercalcemia and a high PTH. I sent myself for a sestamibi scan and my colleague found two localized points.

After that I asked my ENT friend to see me and he said sure. He said he'd like me to go see his general surgery friend to confirm the diagnosis. The surgeon was a pleasant guy but he told me that he wasn't prepared to operate this. He did an ultrasound on me in his rooms and said he saw nothing. He also said my vitamin D was low and that was the cause. He then said he's turned down two patients in the same week with the same problem and that I must come back in 6 months. He said the nuclear scan is too vague and there's no good localization. 

Frustrated, I went back to my friend who then decided to side with the surgeon... saying that we should wait to see if it 'matures'. I understood that they didn't want to operate and find nothing, but I knew it was there. I had symptoms. I had hypercalcemia. He outright told me maybe I'm working too hard and it's depression.

I then went off to my other friend, a general surgeon who decided he would operate me. He repeated the blood tests and found them to be markedly elevated. I had an outpatient parathyroid exploration the next day and they removed a 1g adenoma from the right inferior pole behind the thyroid gland. Three weeks later and I'm a new man. I can remember things, and I no longer need to force myself to stay awake from midday. It's like a thick cloud has lifted from me.

I understand the first surgeon was wrong about a few things, but I have since learned that many of his answers are common opinions among specialists (like blaming Vit D for a high PTH, even though a high calcium will never be found in these cases). It's easy to tell someone to come back in 6 months for a re-check, but it's not you that is suffering from crippling insomnia and pseudodementia. I can't imagine what it must be like to be a lay person and to feel completely helpless in this situation - I was at least enabled in a way and could partially steer my treatment.

But rather than say you are screwed, if you folks want, I'll help you unite and start fighting back.

If you're wondering why a JD gives a shit or wtf I know about getting this done, I'll explain. I was a member of a non-profit for an orphan condition that provided support for patients. One pharmaceutical company, whose sole source of income depends on this condition, well over a billion dollars, donated half of the entire budget for the nonprofit and basically took control of the organization. Said pharmaceutical company, sent letters threatening to take the medication away from the patients unless they signed a HIPAA waiver allowing the company to use protected information for marketing purposes. I've seen some sketchy shit but I couldn't believe it. Naturally I suggested we fight back and I would look into suing the fuckers.

Shortly after, the nonprofit, with almost no notice, terminated the support group, which had existed for close to a decade and had tens of thousands of posts and thousands of members. Apparently the pharmaceutical company  wasn't pleased with the criticism. The member begged them to keep it functioning and we couldn't even get a response. It devastated the community. No one knew what to do and felt helpless. So I did something crazy, I suggested we start our own. Naysayers were vocal, saying it was hopeless. No one else stepped up to lead, so I did. We reached our funding goal in less than a day and we were up and running in two weeks. A year later we were the largest group for the condition and page one on Google.

An insider MD I've been friends with for years confirmed it was the pharmaceutical company behind the shutdown. The MD was terrified regarding retaliation and was worried I'd face their wrath if I caused trouble. Pretty sure the MD thought I was nuts when I said they could bring it on. After chatting with them later, the MD expressed their frustration with the current state of medicine, namely administration. The MD loves medicine and is one of the kindest people I've ever known, but seemed to be miserable for the same reasons you folks mention. It pissed me off so here I am.

So I know a thing or two about starting an organization and rallying people to a common cause, not to mention the legal bullshit that entails. It's a lot of work but despite not making a dime, saving that group was unquestionably the most rewarding thing I've ever done.

After living half my life with an undiagnosed condition and one physician that broke the time limit rules and went way beyond adequate care, diagnosed it and changed my life forever, I am physician advocate to the end. My wife is also an MD.

I can't lead the charge on this one. One of you folks commented months ago suggesting, I organize physicians but the letters at the end of my name sort of preclude that. But I can help and participate if just a handful of you are passionate, willing to take action and able devote your time to change.

With or without me, stop just talking. It's getting worse and it's going to become harder to change the more time passes. Take action. Physicians and their patients deserve better.

Apologies for the personal story. I figured the post wouldn't make sense without some background. I'm happy to provide more information on how to get this going if you folks are interested.

Don't get hung up on the word union. An association might be a better option. I just used union because that's what most people talk about. The key is to identify the best organizational structure for the objective. I can explain in greater detail later.

Edit:

Thank you all for commenting. I was hoping, and still hope, one of you will take charge of this mess. My intent was not to lead but to inspire and assist the doctors who would take the helm. It's an interesting world we live in when a attorney ends up advocating for medical professionals. I am happy to do as much as I can if need be. My apologies if I haven't replied to messages. My inbox died but I'll try to reply later. I haven't had any resilience training so I need sleep /s

Edit:

For the skeptics, I scored in the 90th percentile on the lsat, went to the best law school in the state, had the highest score on one or two sections of the bar in my state, have been a partner at two firms and started my own 5 years ago. This is my bookshelf. The paper says masteroflaw but imgur ruined the resolution so it's hard to read.

[https://imgur.com/a/QP21RA6](https://imgur.com/a/QP21RA6)

Also to the folks saying I don't know what I'm talking about regarding unions because they read it on Google, you might consider how it feels when a patient does that to you regarding medicine. Let's please be respectful. I have not asked anyone for their personal information or money. I'm just trying to help. I sent the mods the link to my nonprofit in the story. Defrauding people is a felony and I'd get disbarred. I'd rather spend my time working for you, not defending myself. Wouldn't you? I understand skepticism and don't find it offensive but I would ask to be treated with the same professional respect I show to physicians and other medical professionals.

I am really inspired and motivated by the vast number of supportive comments. I'm a little overwhelmed with the sheer number of replies so for those wanting to help and have the time, please let me know how much time you can devote. I'm happy to guide you if you don't know what to do.

&gt;How we salivated at the idea of searchable records, of being able to graph fever trends, or white blood counts, or share records at a keystroke with another institution — “interoperability”! — and trash the fax machine. If every hospital were connected, we would have a monster database, Big Data that’s truly big and that would allow us to spot trends in disease so much earlier and determine best practice and predict complications. But we didn’t quite get that when, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, $35 billion was eventually steered toward making medicine paperless.

&gt;My A.T.M. card is amazing: I can get cash and account details all over America and beyond. Yet I can’t reliably get a patient record from across town, let alone from a hospital in the same state, even if both places use the same brand of E.H.R., for reasons that are only partly explained by software that has been customized for each site. This is not like sending around a standard Word file. And so, too often the record comes by fax.

I read that, and got angry.  Not because I disagreed, but because the author was completely correct.  I saw potential about 20 years ago, and was at least cautiously optimistic when large amounts of money and incentives were going to implement EHRs.  

Now, nearly 2 decades later, I see that we were sold a bill of goods.  It's all a bunch of garbage.  I am excited that I don't spend hours looking for a paper chart.  But beyond that, we haven't progressed much.  We were promised integration between health records.  I could see the clinic note from the PCM about the foot ulcer from 2 weeks ago, and get the culture results.  The echocardiogram from another hospital done 3 months ago would be a click away.  I wouldn't have to wonder what the discharge medications were from the pneumonia hospitalization last month.  I could even get the operative report from the washout of the failed total knee replacement done 2 years ago.

It's a bunch of crap.  We get none of it.  We are now chained to the computer, and in the name of ""quality"" spend hours adding phrases and codes to make sure that all ""core measures"" are met.  There is absolutely no interoperability to speak of.  Even EHRs of the same vendor aren't interoperable due to both differences in configuration and enforced segmentation which is done in the name of ""privacy and HIPAA"" but I suspect has more to do with limited patient mobility and keeping their information in their own house.

Data still comes and goes via fax machine.  Signatures are still on paper.  Interoperability, where it exists, is limited and expensive.  Want to integrate  your office EHR with Labcorp?  Sure.  You just gotta pay thousands (on top of the tens of thousands annually for the EHR) for the interface.  Same with Quest.  How do we get information for our own hospital system into our EHR?  Same way we did 20 years ago.  Print it out from the hospital EHR, scan it in, and then stick a name on it.  

And, to really put the cherry on top of this, an administrator very proudly rolled out a tool so physicians can track their own productivity!!   They spent thousands of man-hours on this thing.  1 hour of mandatory training (it's ok, I really didn't want to eat anyway).  And the module for automated outlier screening, promised &gt;2 years ago, is still nowhere to be found.

Anybody have the number for that truck driving school, Truckmaster?  I think I may need that.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was reading a post on Sermo regarding physician burnout (no surprise), and came across this quote:&lt;/p&gt;

I could see the clinic note from the PCM about the foot ulcer from 2 weeks ago, and get the culture results.  The echocardiogram from another hospital done 3 months ago would be a click away.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to wonder what the discharge medications were from the pneumonia hospitalization last month.  I could even get the operative report from the washout of the failed total knee replacement done 2 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bunch of crap.  We get none of it.  We are now chained to the computer, and in the name of &amp;quot;quality&amp;quot; spend hours adding phrases and codes to make sure that all &amp;quot;core measures&amp;quot; are met.  There is absolutely no interoperability to speak of.  Even EHRs of the same vendor aren&amp;#39;t interoperable due to both differences in configuration and enforced segmentation which is done in the name of &amp;quot;privacy and HIPAA&amp;quot; but I suspect has more to do with limited patient mobility and keeping their information in their own house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data still comes and goes via fax machine.  Signatures are still on paper.  Interoperability, where it exists, is limited and expensive.  Want to integrate  your office EHR with Labcorp?  Sure.  You just gotta pay thousands (on top of the tens of thousands annually for the EHR) for the interface.  Same with Quest.  How do we get information for our own hospital system into our EHR?  Same way we did 20 years ago.  Print it out from the hospital EHR, scan it in, and then stick a name on it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, to really put the cherry on top of this, an administrator very proudly rolled out a tool so physicians can track their own productivity!!   They spent thousands of man-hours on this thing.  1 hour of mandatory training (it&amp;#39;s ok, I really didn&amp;#39;t want to eat anyway).  And the module for automated outlier screening, promised &amp;gt;2 years ago, is still nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody have the number for that truck driving school, Truckmaster?  I think I may need that.&lt;/p&gt;

I'd like to share my approach to these cases.  I'm a primary care pediatrician in a suburban/semi-rural facility (USA) with an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population.  I see \~4,000 patients per year.  In a typical year, I will prescribe antibiotics to treat AOM maybe 6-7 times (yes, it's \*that\* rare since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).  I have never had a case in which a child had a poor outcome due to a missed diagnosis.

Parental awareness of acute otitis media is very high.  In the United States, I think that most American parents have a cultural bias towards suspicion of AOM.  I frequently hear complaints such as: ""She's been touching her ear for a month.  I think she might have an ear infection,"" or ""My mother-in-law said that he tugged his ears yesterday and said I should get him checked for an ear infection.""  Obviously, children do not have untreated AOM for a month and AOM is a very uncomfortable condition for the child.

It's important to understand the diagnosis.  The information that I am going to give comes mostly from the 2013 AAP Guidelines on AOM and it \*only applies to children over 60 days of age.\*  Going back to our first year of medical school, we recall that acute focal infections present with four signs: CALOR, RUBOR, TUMOR, and (most importantly) DOLOR.  If the child has no ear complaint, then the child does not have AOM.  I frequently see completely healthy children being put on antibiotics for an ""incidental finding"" of AOM on presentation for an unrelated complaint (examination after motor vehicle accident, for example).  AOM is never an occult process.  There will be a history of ear pain or discomfort.  Sometimes the pain resolves if the TM ruptures, but then there will be a complaint of drainage.

If a child screams loudly enough, the TM will become erythematous.  This hyperemia is not inflammation.  The TM with AOM is OPAQUE, DULL, and has EFFACED LANDMARKS.  Sometimes, it's more white than red.  If pneumatic otoscopy is available, you will see decreased mobility of the TM.  A red TM or an air/fluid level alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis.

Before I even look in the ear of a child with a complaint of otalgia (ear pain), I first *get the history* and then I review the AAP guidelines for treatment with the parents.  This is what I call ""expectation management.""  I explain it to them very much like I explain it to my medical students.

""Before I look in your child's ear, I want to discuss ear infections and what the American Academy of Pediatrics has to say about them.  First, between 90 and 95% of ear infections are caused by viruses, and those won't respond to antibiotics and usually go away in less than two days.  So if I were to give antibiotics to every kid with an ear infection, I'd have to give 10-20 kids antibiotics to make one kid better, which isn't a very good number.  (note: most parents are aware that antibiotics are not without their risks).

""In order to bring that number down to somewhere between 2 and 4, I follow a set of rules laid out by the AAP.  I'll start your child on antibiotics if:

1. The ear pain has been present for more than 48 hours.\*
2. The ear pain is not responding to appropriate doses of Tylenol or Motrin (*note: parents usually under-dose because they follow the instructions on the box.  The manufacturers of these medications very responsibly tend to guess low on their dosing recommendations so as to avoid overdoses.  Ask the parents what dose they are using*).
3. The child is under 6mo.
4. The ear drum has ruptured and there is pus leaking out.
5. There is a temperature of 102.2F or higher.
6. Your child has special risk factors, such as being an organ transplant patient or having ear tubes or something like that.

""So let me have a look...""

\*Note: if the pain has not been present for 48 hours, then I say: ""And in your case, it hasn't been 48 hours, so if there is an ear infection, I'll give you a kind of prescription called a 'wait-and-see' prescription for antibiotics that can't be filled until (48 hours after they said the pain began).  That way, you don't have to come back if he doesn't improve.  In the mean time, if the pain should get worse and stop responding to pain medication, you can call us and we'll approve an earlier fill on the antibiotic.""

For wait-and-see prescriptions, I put ""WAIT-AND-SEE RX.  PLEASE DO NOT FILL BEFORE 5PM ON 1/25/19"" in the instructions.  I set the expiration date for the prescription for one week after the visit date.

In the vast majority of cases, there either isn't AOM present or there is a resolving viral AOM.  But if there is an AOM, I've already explained what I'm going to do and so now I've set the parents' expectations in line with my action.

I find that parents usually appreciate this explanation and also understand that I am not going to leave them high-and-dry with a screaming child in pain and no way to address it.

&amp;#x200B;

That's how I do it.

I was called to do a C-section for a 16 year old, father of baby also 16. She asked if both her boyfriend and her mother could be in the OR with us and I of course said yes. I met her and she seemed spunky, fun, sassy, but in pain due to her preeclampsia. Her boyfriend was....wide eyed and extremely quiet. In my experience these young fathers-to-be are often silent and anxious and very prone to freaking out, obviously not ready for the challenges ahead and kind of wrapped up in their own meltdown, often to the point where they can't really engage fully in what's going on. That's the initial impression I got.

We go to the OR, I place the spinal, and now she's feeling good, very happy and her full, delightful personality comes out. Her mom and boyfriend join us. I notice her mother is excited and very supportive, and I notice she is also paying extra special attention to calming down her daughter's boyfriend and reassuring him, which I thought was very sweet and a sign that good support systems would hopefully be in place for this young couple. That said, he was still quiet and like a deer in headlights. I assumed he'd be like other teen dads I'd met, who were kind of detached and obviously freaking out about what's going on. He stayed quiet as the procedure got under way.

To my surprise, baby is about to be delivered, and he's gripping mom's hand so tight...When we hear the baby cry, I'm focused on plugging in oxytocin etc. when I hear a sound next to me...I look over and see that he is smiling and sobbing, tears of joy streaming down his face.

He was invited over to the warmer while NICU evaluated the baby (premature but doing very well), and he holds out a finger, which the baby grabs, and he just keeps sobbing and sobbing and smiling, unable to control this rush of emotions as he meets his child for the first time, while still honestly being a child himself.

This doesn't happen to me often. Most of my patients are asleep, most are getting something routine and/or unpleasant done in the OR. I love OB and spend a lot of time on L&amp;D, and I love the reactions of the new dads. But even so....this young man was so overcome by his emotions he couldn't hold them in. It touched me in a way I don't often experience in medicine, and I nearly cried myself. 

These two new parents have a lot of struggles and challenges ahead, but the patient smiled and told me, ""I wasn't expecting that of him."" Combined with how loving and supporting her mother was of the two of them, it gave me hope, and it was such a genuine, emotional, happy moment, I don't think I'll ever forget it.

It's nice to get a reminder sometimes that people can surprise you, and that life can really, sometimes, be truly joyful, even if only for a short time before the drudgery of day-to-day comes back to hit us over the head.

I’m reporting it accurately but surprise, no changes. I’m off on sundays usually. We have a night float so no post call days. I get two weeks of vacation, my first is in February.    

My depression has been worsening significantly. I need help. But I can’t get any.

I go home and cry myself to sleep before waking up and doing it all over again.   

I called around. No psych places within a 50 mile radius are open on sundays or past 7 pm.

It took a while to figure out what was going on. He wouldn't sit still long enough for imaging, and sedatives weren't working. He was getting close to buying a tube.

Doc ordered the reversal agent, physostigmine, which he hadn't given in 10 years, he said. Charge nurse of 25 years said she has only seen it once. I was fascinated. It was to be given over 5 mins and I watched the monitor the entire time. Heart rate started dropping slowly from 115 and eventually evened out at 98. At about 4:30, he sat straight up in bed and started talking normal and was lucid. Hole-lee shit.


Sorry, y'all. I really enjoy learning about stuff like that and wanted to share it with you. Apparently this doesn't happen very often and I was excited to learn. The kid ended up being completely fine after a couple hours and relocated the next morning. He admitted taking a large quantity of benadryl. 


Has anyone else experienced this, or something like it? What kind of medical mysteries have you run in to?

I wrote my physician a thank you letter. I went to a sleep doctor when I was 17 because I was falling asleep standing in the shower every morning. I was tested with an overnight study and was told it was relatively normal. There was no follow up or treatment. 13 years later, I was at the end of my rope. I was sent to another sleep physician. He had terrible online reviews. He listened to my history and said, he thought he knew the problem after spending an hour with me going over my history. He didn't say what but he did another overnight study and a multiple sleep latency test. My follow-up was the following week. 

Again he sat down with me for about an hour to explain I had narcolepsy without cataplexy and how the original test when I was 17 wasn't sufficient. My quality of life has improved so much, words cannot express my gratitude to this physician. I later learned, he was the first physician in my area to have a sleep lab that was able to properly diagnose all known sleep disorders. He frequently gives talks on raising awareness of rare sleep disorders. 

He's considered the best in the area by physicians, but still has poor patient reviews. There's no way this guy makes a dime treating me because he spends too much time with me at each follow up. I also learned he turned down over a quarter million dollars from a pharmaceutical company. He profoundly changed my life. It's been over five years I've been a patient.

The day after sending my letter to him, I received a call from him thanking me for the letter. He said with all the frustration dealing with insurance, unreasonable patients, etc, he really appreciated the letter. It made medicine worthwhile. I could tell it meant more to him than any amount of money I could ever give him. 

I figured, I'd share my story. I'm an attorney and I understand how awful the service industry can be. Thank you to all the physicians that go the extra mile. Thank you for putting up with the daily frustrations and still doing your best. Some of us really do appreciate your work. 

Edit: I will add that he's been practicing a long time. If you're a sleep medicine specialist in the US that treats narcolepsy, you've probably heard of him or read one of his publications. He doesn't seem to be retiring anytime soon but I noticed he's never been awarded any achievement award I could find so I was looking for some way to at least nominate him for his work.

&lt;p&gt;But what I&amp;#39;ll remember most was earlier in the week when the husband was proudly telling us that they&amp;#39;d been married for 60 years. He turned to her and added &amp;quot;and she&amp;#39;s loved me for every second of that, right?&amp;quot; In that brief moment, she was lucid. She just smiled and shook her head no.&lt;/p&gt;

“Let’s start off by clarifying what I tell all of you, you’re just a medical student, you’re not going to impress me”
“Get out of medicine while you still can!”

There’s no doubt you could take each of the comments above and chalk it up to that or even make a reasonable argument that they’re right.

I was right out of residency, and had inherited a patient population who had been prescribed opioids, benzodiazepines, and stimulants very liberally. Those classes of medications are written in prolific volumes throughout this entire region. Between the patients I inherited, and patients coming from as far as hundreds of miles away to test a new physician’s narcotic prescribing habits, literally 75% of the appointments being scheduled were patients specifically requesting narcotics of one form or another. 

It was at a crisis level. My staff and I were overwhelmed, and I was unable to get my diabetics, hypertensives, or any other patients seen as often as they should be. The non-narcotic patients who did get in to see me found considerable wait times, as the narcotic patients would haggle, threaten, and/or beg, consuming disproportionate amounts of time from my other patients. Verbal abuse was a daily problem. Attempts at intimidation were common. My nurses would cry. There were death threats and calls to administration. To make matters worse, the closest pain management specialist was 45-60 minutes away.

For other young physicians coming out of residency and finding themselves in this situation, know that you can get through it. I have a thriving and healthy practice only a year later, seeing enough patients that I will be adding a mid-level to assist me. 

I started sending a letter to every single new patient scheduled, notifying them that I do not prescribe chronic opioids, benzodiazepines, or stimulants. I would be happy to care for their other medical conditions, but they would be referred to specialists for those medications. This single step all but solved the problem. 

All new patients requesting an appointment were ran through the prescriber’s database. Records were reviewed prior to scheduling. Those who did come in on chronic narcotics were evaluated. I counseled them on non-narcotic therapies, which were almost universally rejected. I would then refer when testing or records indicated it was appropriate - many came in on opioids without even basic testing to verify diagnoses! There were some appropriately-diagnosed patients who were in too poor of a condition to make the trip to pain management. When appropriate, I placed these patients on pain contracts, documented copiously, and treated them according to guidelines. 

I was able to convince several patients to enter rehab, or to allow me to help them taper off of inappropriate medications. These have proven to be some of my most thankful patients.

If you find yourself in this situation, don’t give up on rural medicine. You are needed out here, and you can have a happy and beneficial practice. Just take control, develop some solid policies, and as one of the best pieces of advice on this reddit said last year, “be fair, be kind, and be appropriate.”

I was raised by a mother who was a nurse for something close to 40 years, and one things bothers me to this day… actually almost every day: why a lot of people working in healthcare have a tendency to dismiss other professions and make themselves look better?

Let me explain, starting from the bottom:  

- **CPR instructors:** when I was doing a CPR training the instructors were describing how neither EMTs nor nurses can provide a good CPR and how much they’re better at this.
- **Phlebotomists:** I had an occasion to audit parts of the course as well as encounter phlebotomists both in the field and also drawing me. Due to limited SoP the main point of contention is how nursers are unable to draw, don’t know the order of draw, use too big of a needle etc.
- **EMT-Bs:** I went throughout the program and I currently teach it. I see a tendency of saying how paramedics or (especially) nurses are incompetent and how EMT-B will do a much better job at e.g. CPR or assessment. 
- **EMT-Ps/Paramedics:** Here I could write an essay but in short it’s a daily occurrence to complain at the nursing personnel. I constantly hear how capno, FAST, or intubation are some sort of black magic which paramedics excel at. Additionally there’s a constant finger-pointing about nurses being tethered to a physician with everything while paramedics are free to do almost anything (?!).
- **Nurses:** Here the complains are both downward facing (EMS) and upward facing to PAs and MDs/DOs. I constantly hear how the process of diagnosing patients is so much better while performed by a nurses, since they are able to spend more time with the pt. Additionally the drug dosing and tests results interpretation seems to be the biggest advantage of NPs over PAs/MDs/DOs.
- **PAs:** I don’t have a big exposure to that group, but a number of times (sometimes publicly and/or on social media) I’ve encounter Physician Assistants presenting doctors as money-grabbing machines with just „slightly more wasted years“ (an actual quote).


I deliberately left MDs/DOs out of the list, since the issue there seems to be way more complicated (e.g. fights between specialties, trying to prove that one residency is better than the other etc).  

### Why, just why we s**t into our own bed?!
I just wonder what’s your opinion on that? I personally think this is really inappropriate and simply selfish - we **are a team**, when even one of the preciously crafted gear of the medical machine is missing the work becomes harder and patients suffer as the result. Not to mention such behaviors simply look bad in the eyes of patients.  
While I can agree on some points looking at some HCPs most of the time it’s a typical BS IMHO.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m in the healthcare personally for more than six years.

The Indian population has extremely mixed feelings towards doctors. Doctors are venerated like gods, and miracles are expected of them; however when those miracles fail to happen (owing to the limitations of biology and medical sciences) people are quick to turn on the very same person they initially looked to for help.

Treatments are expected, not hoped for - and miracles are demanded.

Patients who have spent all their lives abusing their bodies come to hospitals far too late for medical science to be of any help; they arrive en masse with truckloads of family, friends, neighbors and local goons. If, unfortunately, satisfactory outcomes aren't achieved, the crowd is quick to turn into a mob, baying for the blood of anyone in a white coat. The doctor does not necessarily need to be the one treating the patient - anyone with a stethoscope will do.

There is a widespread mistrust of doctors, with doctors being painted as money-hungry good-for-nothings who profit off the misery of others.

There are several problems with the healthcare system within India, and yet the steps being taken by the government to improve the state of affairs are either wholly misguided, or non existent.

This is just another one in a long list of attacks on Indian doctors. The story, every time, is similar - old patient who could have been saved only if the family would've brought him to a hospital many months earlier is brought in in a critical condition; patient dies despite the best efforts of the team; patient's family and friends blame the doctor for the death and proceed to cause bodily injury to whoever they see in a white coat. After every attack, junior doctors go on strike, asking for better security, however, no steps are taken (neither to increase hospital security nor to prosecute the aggressors). Eventually, doctors are forced to resume working in substandard conditions, often under threat of losing their jobs (last time this happened in Maharashtra, the residents who went on strike were told by the government that they would be fired if they didn't return to work).

India supplies a large number of doctors to other countries. Perhaps this is why.

I was an intern in a government hospital in an Indian city. One day as I performed CPR in the ER on a lady with an MI, a man threatened to hurt me because I wasn't paying enough attention to his (stable) stroke patient. I was threatened for not providing free antipyretics to a child who was not feverish (I wanted to keep the medicines for an acutely ill child since resources are scarce). I once ran away from the ER when a large mob gathered since as a 5'2"" girl, I would be pretty much dominated in a physical fight and I did not want to be another news story.

Sometimes I feel like being a doctor in India is breaking my spirit.

Edit - Update on the situation in India. The protest is still on. The Chief Minister of the state has threatened the protesting doctors, telling them to go back to work else they will be forced to vacate the hostels. A boys' hostel has been burned by the mob. Mobs have gathered around medical colleges in Calcutta, with hooligans threatening to kill and rape doctors. Several medical students and doctors have been injured. There have been attempts to throw acid of female doctors. The worst part is, the chief minister ordered the police to attack the protesting doctors with batons. And the whole nation is silent.

I am currently a PGY1 in OBGYN. Excuse this post, but I feel like I need to share this quick story and brag on myself just a little bit. Long story short, I’ve been liking residency so far and I’m certain I went into the right field. However since starting, I’ve always felt like I was just “fitting in.” I was able to take care of floor patients, write orders, give prescriptions, deliver babies, and even be primary on c-sections. I know that I was able to help patients, but it almost felt routine.

Today though, I was in our eval (kind of like a women’s ED). As the intern, I was the first to see everyone and come up with a plan before going over it with my upper levels. A woman came in with mild cramping at 30 WGA. She had good baby movement, no vaginal bleeding, no loss of fluid. I thought it was a routine maternal discomfort complaint but as soon as I saw her strip, I knew something was up. She had been on the monitor for a few minutes, but I think I saw some prolonged decels and mild, short interval contractions. I told my chief, but we weren’t sure as we didn’t have a good baseline yet. He just told me to keep an eye on it.

So anyways I kept routinely triaging folks. 15 minutes later, she started gushing blood and felt severe abdominal pain. She had abrupted and had a stat C. This was the first time I had seen an abruption.  It’s true what they say: you’ll never forget the presentation once you see an abruption. Luckily she did ok but the chief and attending told me that normally, they’d wait a few minutes to see a “maternal discomfort” patient as they generally aren’t as severe as laboring or bleeding patients. However since I noticed the decels and the contractions, we were able to atleast make the OR aware of a possible stat. It was a great compliment to hear the chief and attending say “good job, you helped save her and her baby.”

So all of this happened ~5 days ago. Today, I went up to the ICU to check on this kid, because so many people were affected by her death, not only at the ER, but also here, on Reddit. And I cleared up a few things, namely, when I said the girl was expected to survive, I meant that her chance of survival was about 40%, miraculously high compared to earlier. 

Unfortunately, like so many others like her, that little girl joined the majority of that statistic.

First up, I just want to say that we tried to save her, all of us. The paramedics raced to the scene, and even before the police came there, they picked up the little girl, breaking the rules and pushing the parents aside. In the ambulance, they performed CPR, intubated her, and started an IV line. In the ER, we did our best. We brought her back from an asystolic state to VF. We shocked her back to a sinus rhythm. We staunched as much blood flow as we could.

The surgeons operated on this little girl right there in the ER. They took her to the ICU, where she received round-the-clock care and assistance. She was given morphine in order for everything to be as painless as possible.

Sadly, that wasn't enough. The damage her bastard parents did to her was too great, and late last night, she succumbed to her injuries. In the moments before she died, she was minimally conscious. One of the nurses in the ICU held her hand as she became unconscious.

I'm typing this at 3am just because this is how I vent out my frustrations. This is how I hold myself together. This is how I stay in my job, striving through each day. Writing is how I do these things.

I'm going to her funeral on Thursday. I'll pay my respects, along with other members of the hospital staff, EMS crew, police officers, total strangers to this girl, and CPS workers. Nobody else will be there, not even an auntie, or a grandma. This just shows you how much this little girl was neglected. Not many people cared for her. And it was only in her last moments that anyone showed some sympathy towards her.

But I shouldn't be going to her funeral. I shouldn't be lighting a candle in her memory, or keeping vigil around her coffin. I should not even know her at all. If someone told authorities what was going on in this little girl's home, her life would have been saved. And people noticed, but they didn't tell. And none of them are or should be going to her funeral.

That's what makes me mad about society.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an update on &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/35ghgl/after_witnessing_this_i_want_to_personally/""&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;.

In the ambulance, they performed CPR, intubated her, and started an IV line. In the ER, we did our best. We brought her back from an asystolic state to VF. We shocked her back to a sinus rhythm. We staunched as much blood flow as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surgeons operated on this little girl right there in the ER. They took her to the ICU, where she received round-the-clock care and assistance. She was given morphine in order for everything to be as painless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, that wasn&amp;#39;t enough. The damage her bastard parents did to her was too great, and late last night, she succumbed to her injuries. In the moments before she died, she was minimally conscious. One of the nurses in the ICU held her hand as she became unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m typing this at 3am just because this is how I vent out my frustrations. This is how I hold myself together. This is how I stay in my job, striving through each day. Writing is how I do these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to her funeral on Thursday. I&amp;#39;ll pay my respects, along with other members of the hospital staff, EMS crew, police officers, total strangers to this girl, and CPS workers. Nobody else will be there, not even an auntie, or a grandma. This just shows you how much this little girl was neglected. Not many people cared for her. And it was only in her last moments that anyone showed some sympathy towards her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I shouldn&amp;#39;t be going to her funeral. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be lighting a candle in her memory, or keeping vigil around her coffin. I should not even know her at all. If someone told authorities what was going on in this little girl&amp;#39;s home, her life would have been saved. And people noticed, but they didn&amp;#39;t tell. And none of them are or should be going to her funeral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what makes me mad about society.&lt;/p&gt;

Feel free to agree or disagree, or to add your own.

(For the record, I certainly don’t claim to deliver perfect patient care, and have been guilty of committing more than a few of these myself!  Categorization into fields isn’t meant to imply that specialists in each field are the primary culprits.)



**Cardiology**

* Admitting a patient for “r/o MI”, and not mentioning their ECG in the admission H&amp;P (bonus annoyance points for instead documenting “ECG: NSR”).

* Reflexively checking BID electrolytes in every patient on diuretics (sometimes appropriate, but often not necessary)

* Reflexively repleting every patient’s K&gt;4 and Mg&gt;2. (How did this practice become ubiquitous?)

* Reflexively checking a troponin in response to a brief episode of asymptomatic NSVT (bonus annoyance points if the ordering doc doesn’t bother with a follow-up troponin)

* CT surgeons, anesthesiologists, or emergency med docs who cannot reliably interpret an ECG.

* Fluid restricting patients with heart failure exacerbations. (it’s sodium restriction that’s helpful)

* Placing a patient on two hemodynamic drugs simultaneously which have directly antagonizing effects. (e.g. midodrine and hydralazine, dopamine and metoprolol, etc…)

* Describing a patient as “preload-dependent” because of [aortic stenosis/pulmonary hypertension/ diastolic dysfunction/etc…] (all patients are preload-dependent!)

* Micromanaging the blood pressure in a patient with no other cardiovascular disease (e.g. orders for prn hydralazine for SBP&gt;160).

* Continuing statins in hospice patients.

* Placing a patient on a low fat “cardiac diet” because of a history of CAD. (hospital food is already bad tasting enough!)

* Assuming a patient with an irregular pulse has a-fib without checking an ECG.

* Stating that a patient can’t have tamponade because he/she isn’t hypotensive.



**Pulmonology**

* Admitting a patient for pneumonia, and not mentioning the CXR in the admission H&amp;P.

* Admitting a patient for any pulmonary complaint, and relying on the formal interpretation of the CXR without even looking at it oneself.

* Assuming that a patient with a chronic cough and strong smoking history must have COPD.

* Diagnosing pneumonia based solely on CXR findings, irrespective of the presence or absence of consistent symptoms/signs/lab tests.

* Stating that a patient can’t have a PE because he/she isn’t hypoxemic.



**Critical Care**

* “Renal dose dopamine” (yes, our hospital still has docs who insist on this!)

* Using the heart rate as a primary indicator of volume status.

* Reflexively giving Lasix to every patient with pulmonary edema.

* When there is no room for your sick medicine patient to move to the ICU because the CT surgeons refuse to transfer out their post-op CABG patients who have been stable for days.

* When your patient codes, and no one gets around to informing you until hours later.



**Renal/Fluids**

* When a patient with mild hyperkalemia and no ECG changes is given the full smorgasbord of hyperkalemia treatment - calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb, albuterol, and tons and tons of kayexalate. (bonus annoyance points if no one even checked for ECG changes before ordering all of that)

* Conflation of “prerenal AKI” with dehydration. (AKI from heart failure is “prerenal” too!)

* Not checking a UA in patients with AKI.

* Giving sodium bicarb for a moderate metabolic acidosis.

* Reporting the results of a UA as “dirty”.

* Placing a patient on overnight IVF when they are NPO from midnight for a procedure scheduled for 8am.



**GI**

* Ordering a stool guauic for a patient whose stool is visibly bloody or melenic. (bonus annoyance points if the intern is only checking it because the GI fellow insisted).

* Ordering a PPI for a soft reason, which will likely be continued for years before another doctor reexamines whether it’s appropriate.



**Endocrine**

* Placing an insulin-dependent diabetic on only a sliding scale.

* Continuing qid finger sticks for weeks in chronic patients whose diabetes is controlled well enough to never require insulin.

* Deciding against the use of metformin in a patient solely because his/her creatinine is 1.6 - and above a traditional, arbitrary, and evidence-free cutoff of 1.5. (bonus annoyance points if the doc actually wants to prescribe it, but the pharmacist declines to approve the order.)

* Checking TSHs in critically ill patients (exception: the very rare patients whose critical illness could be predominantly due to thyroid disease)

* Seeing a diabetic food tray full of non-diabetic-friendly food. (bonus annoyance points if it includes an Oreo brownie)



**Rheum**

* Confirming or refuting a diagnosis of gout in a patient with a hot, swollen joint using a serum uric acid level instead of arthrocentesis.

* Ordering 25 different autoantibodies in a patient presenting with a vague, multisystem disease “just to be sure it’s not autoimmune”. (bonus annoyance points if a 1:40 ANA then prompts a formal rheum consult)



**Hematology/Oncology**

* When an oncologist declines to consult on a patient with suspected malignancy until the malignancy is confirmed via pathology.

* When a proceduralist/surgeon requires a patient’s INR to be below some low and arbitrary threshold prior to a procedure (bonus annoyance points when they express no interest in the patient’s bleeding history – a much better predictor of bleeding risk).

* Reflexively transfusing at an arbitrary hemoglobin, irrespective of symptoms or other medical problems.

* Using a higher-than-normal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion simply because a patient has a history of CAD. (it’s *active* ischemia that should be a reason to transfuse to higher Hb goals)

* Diuresing an anemic patient for the primary purpose of hemoconcentration.



**ID**

* Daily ESRs or CRPs

* Feeling obligated to switch to PO antibiotics for 1 day prior to discharge, to make sure the patient’s infection doesn’t worsen due to narrowed coverage or poor absorption. (It will take longer than a day for the infection to worsen to a point that you’ll be able to observe.)

* Insistence on always using the same temperature cutoff as constituting a “fever”, and reacting to every “fever” in the same way. (i.e. sending blood cultures on every patient whose temp is &gt;=101.0, and on no patients whose temp is &lt;101.0)

* Being excessively dogmatic with antibiotic courses in situations of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. a patient with known Staph bacteremia who is estimated to have a ~10% chance of endocarditis must be treated with 6 weeks of IV antibiotics because endocarditis wasn’t “ruled out”).

* When infection control won’t let us take a patient off respiratory isolation for TB until they have been formally ruled out, despite the order having been placed accidentally. (yes, this really happened!)



**Pain management**

* Dosing narcotics less frequently than their duration of action. (i.e. oxycodone bid)

* Ordering acetaminophen as the only prn pain med in a patient whose chief complaint is pain.

* Refusing to give narcotics to an inpatient with a history of substance abuse, irrespective of how severe their acute pain is.



**Neuro**

* Documenting a patient’s neuro exam as “non-focal”. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was a neurologic symptom)

* Not assessing the gait of a patient on admission. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was “weakness” or “falls”)

* The use of a stethoscope head as a reflex hammer.

* Reflexively ordering a vitamin B12, TSH, and RPR in every patient presenting with altered mental status.

* When the reason for a patient’s admission and/or their documented chief complaint is “altered mental status” without any further description (e.g. excessive drowsiness, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, etc…)

* Reporting the results of a head CT as “negative”.



**Psych**

* Calling a psych consult on a medicine inpatient with stable depression. (bonus annoyance points if the patient will be discharged within a day and already has a close relationship with an outpatient psychiatrist)

* Overreliance on antipsychotics for delirium before first attempting non-pharmacologic strategies.



**Orthopedics**

* When a ortho resident attempts to turf an admission to medicine because the patient is “too medically complex”, despite the fact that the ortho service is comanaged by a dedicated hospitalist 24/7.



**Urology**

* When a medicine resident calls a urology resident for help placing a urinary catheter that the nurses couldn’t place, and the urologist requests that the medicine residents try to place it first. (bonus annoyance points when the urologist then becomes irate when informed that the med resident subsequently caused urethral trauma)



**Emergency Medicine**

* When the ED calls to admit a patient for “r/o chest pain” without first getting an ECG.

* When the ED gives antibiotics without first acquiring relevant cultures.

* When the ED tells the only family member who can provide critical collateral information that they can go home before the admitting doc has had a chance to speak with them. 

* When a medicine R2 debates with a ED attending of 25 years’ experience about the need for a patient to be admitted without consideration of their unequal years of experience.



**Radiology**

* When a radiologist determines whether a patient with impaired renal function can receive contrast for either CT or MRI based only on the serum creatinine, without considering age, muscle mass, comorbid conditions, indication for scan, or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the scan.

* When the interpreting radiologist for a scan doesn’t address the stated indication for the scan within the interpretation.

* When the primary team orders a radiology study and doesn’t include an accurate indication in the request.

* When a radiologist won’t approve a seasoned hospitalist’s request for an MRI brain until a neurology R2 concurs (bonus annoyance points if it’s July).



**Communication/Charting**

* Charting “Code Status: DNR/DNI” in an admission H&amp;P without any indication as to how that decision was made.

* When a consultant stops seeing a patient without communicating that they are signing off.

* When a consultant conveys to an intern on the primary team that they feel really strongly about a particular course of action, but then don’t speak with the hospitalist directly, and don’t convey the strength of that recommendation in the chart.

* When a consultant conveys to a patient that they will/will not be discharged that day, without first discussing it with the primary team.

* Referring to a family member as “the wife” or “the son”. (it’s his/her wife, his/her son)

* Referring to the patient as “Mr.” or “Mrs.” so-and-so when speaking to a family member. (much better to say “*your* father/mother/brother/sister/etc…”)

* Ignoring the nurse during walk rounds, despite he/she standing right there at the bedside.

* When housestaff signout to the on-call team and spend 30 seconds on each of 10 patients, rather than handing over a list of 9 patients, and spending 5 minutes discussing the one patient who is particularly sick/complicated.

* Documenting a chief complaint that consists of a laundry list of 15 unrelated medical problems (“Ms. Smith is a 60 year old woman with a past history significant for hypertension, smoking, homelessness, osteoarthritis, CKD, COPD, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer s/p mastectomy and chemo, DVT in 2010, onychomycosis, and chronic low grade transaminitis, now presenting with LLE cellulitis”)

* Documenting an assessment in an H&amp;P that’s word-for-word identical to its chief complaint.

* Failing to look at the reason for presentation as documented by the ED triage nurse (it’s amazing how often the ED triage nurse, ED doc, and admitting medicine resident’s chief complaints are inconsistent)

* When the med list in the discharge instructions, med list in the discharge summary, and the official outpatient medication list in the EMR all disagree.

* When the respiratory rate of every patient on the ward is documented as either 18 or 20.

* When I/Os are fastidiously recorded on patients for whom it’s irrelevant, and patients with renal failure are recorded as having “bathroom privileges”.

* Stating “the patient *failed* such-and-such chemo regimen”. (Patients don’t fail chemo regimens; it’s the chemo regimens that fail patients)

* Stating “the patient *refused* their 3am lab draw”. (Better to say “the patient *declined* their 3am lab draw”.)

* Getting worked up over the difference between “historian” and “informant”. (This is one word choice on the wards that does actually seems trivial.)

* When a doc talks disparagingly about NAs, RNs, NPs, and/or PAs as an entire profession.

* When a non-doc talks disparagingly about docs as an entire profession (bonus annoyance points if it’s an NP wearing a “heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor” shirt)



**General**

* Referring to professional society guidelines as if they were laws that must be followed.

* Lean

* Referring to patients as “customers”. (bonus annoyance points if it’s during a daily huddle to discuss lean management techniques)

* When someone cancels a lab order and doesn’t inform the ordering doc. (bonus annoyance points if it’s a phlebotomist who felt that a delirious, semi-comatose patient “refused” the blood draw)

* When an outside hospital transfers a patient and fails to include a discharge summary. (bonus annoyance points if they include 100+ pages of nursing notes)

* Attempting to discharge a patient without first assessing how the patient is going to get home.

* Citing a study in a progress note that doesn’t actually support whatever point the writer was implying it supported.

* Failing to question an unexpected, bizarre lab value as possibly being “bad data”. (“Sure, I suppose this person recovering from a hip fracture, whose sodium yesterday was normal, could have a sodium of 90 today, but maybe we should recheck it first before starting the 3% saline…”)

* When a PMD insists that the patient they are trying to directly admit to a particular medicine ward is appropriate for that level of care, despite the doc never having stepped foot on the ward in question.

* Making a medical decision primarily based on metrics or patient satisfaction ratings.

* Failing to adequately incorporate a patient’s personal preferences and social situation in crafting a treatment plan.

* When one runs to the coffee shop to make it just before closing, only to find that they decided to close 5 minutes early.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling a little crispy after 6 straight weeks on inpatient wards, I decided to share my top 100 pet peeves, almost all of which came up during this month and a half.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the reason for a patient’s admission and/or their documented chief complaint is “altered mental status” without any further description (e.g. excessive drowsiness, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, etc…)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reporting the results of a head CT as “negative”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psych&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling a psych consult on a medicine inpatient with stable depression. (bonus annoyance points if the patient will be discharged within a day and already has a close relationship with an outpatient psychiatrist)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overreliance on antipsychotics for delirium before first attempting non-pharmacologic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orthopedics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a ortho resident attempts to turf an admission to medicine because the patient is “too medically complex”, despite the fact that the ortho service is comanaged by a dedicated hospitalist 24/7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a medicine resident calls a urology resident for help placing a urinary catheter that the nurses couldn’t place, and the urologist requests that the medicine residents try to place it first. (bonus annoyance points when the urologist then becomes irate when informed that the med resident subsequently caused urethral trauma)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ED calls to admit a patient for “r/o chest pain” without first getting an ECG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ED gives antibiotics without first acquiring relevant cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ED tells the only family member who can provide critical collateral information that they can go home before the admitting doc has had a chance to speak with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a medicine R2 debates with a ED attending of 25 years’ experience about the need for a patient to be admitted without consideration of their unequal years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a radiologist determines whether a patient with impaired renal function can receive contrast for either CT or MRI based only on the serum creatinine, without considering age, muscle mass, comorbid conditions, indication for scan, or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the interpreting radiologist for a scan doesn’t address the stated indication for the scan within the interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the primary team orders a radiology study and doesn’t include an accurate indication in the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a radiologist won’t approve a seasoned hospitalist’s request for an MRI brain until a neurology R2 concurs (bonus annoyance points if it’s July).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication/Charting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charting “Code Status: DNR/DNI” in an admission H&amp;amp;P without any indication as to how that decision was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a consultant stops seeing a patient without communicating that they are signing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a consultant conveys to an intern on the primary team that they feel really strongly about a particular course of action, but then don’t speak with the hospitalist directly, and don’t convey the strength of that recommendation in the chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a consultant conveys to a patient that they will/will not be discharged that day, without first discussing it with the primary team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to a family member as “the wife” or “the son”. (it’s his/her wife, his/her son)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the patient as “Mr.” or “Mrs.” so-and-so when speaking to a family member. (much better to say “&lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; father/mother/brother/sister/etc…”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the nurse during walk rounds, despite he/she standing right there at the bedside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When housestaff signout to the on-call team and spend 30 seconds on each of 10 patients, rather than handing over a list of 9 patients, and spending 5 minutes discussing the one patient who is particularly sick/complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documenting a chief complaint that consists of a laundry list of 15 unrelated medical problems (“Ms. Smith is a 60 year old woman with a past history significant for hypertension, smoking, homelessness, osteoarthritis, CKD, COPD, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer s/p mastectomy and chemo, DVT in 2010, onychomycosis, and chronic low grade transaminitis, now presenting with LLE cellulitis”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documenting an assessment in an H&amp;amp;P that’s word-for-word identical to its chief complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to look at the reason for presentation as documented by the ED triage nurse (it’s amazing how often the ED triage nurse, ED doc, and admitting medicine resident’s chief complaints are inconsistent)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the med list in the discharge instructions, med list in the discharge summary, and the official outpatient medication list in the EMR all disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the respiratory rate of every patient on the ward is documented as either 18 or 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I/Os are fastidiously recorded on patients for whom it’s irrelevant, and patients with renal failure are recorded as having “bathroom privileges”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating “the patient &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt; such-and-such chemo regimen”. (Patients don’t fail chemo regimens; it’s the chemo regimens that fail patients)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating “the patient &lt;em&gt;refused&lt;/em&gt; their 3am lab draw”. (Better to say “the patient &lt;em&gt;declined&lt;/em&gt; their 3am lab draw”.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting worked up over the difference between “historian” and “informant”. (This is one word choice on the wards that does actually seems trivial.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a doc talks disparagingly about NAs, RNs, NPs, and/or PAs as an entire profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a non-doc talks disparagingly about docs as an entire profession (bonus annoyance points if it’s an NP wearing a “heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor” shirt)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to professional society guidelines as if they were laws that must be followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to patients as “customers”. (bonus annoyance points if it’s during a daily huddle to discuss lean management techniques)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone cancels a lab order and doesn’t inform the ordering doc. (bonus annoyance points if it’s a phlebotomist who felt that a delirious, semi-comatose patient “refused” the blood draw)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an outside hospital transfers a patient and fails to include a discharge summary. (bonus annoyance points if they include 100+ pages of nursing notes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempting to discharge a patient without first assessing how the patient is going to get home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a study in a progress note that doesn’t actually support whatever point the writer was implying it supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to question an unexpected, bizarre lab value as possibly being “bad data”. (“Sure, I suppose this person recovering from a hip fracture, whose sodium yesterday was normal, could have a sodium of 90 today, but maybe we should recheck it first before starting the 3% saline…”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a PMD insists that the patient they are trying to directly admit to a particular medicine ward is appropriate for that level of care, despite the doc never having stepped foot on the ward in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a medical decision primarily based on metrics or patient satisfaction ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Failing to adequately incorporate a patient’s personal preferences and social situation in crafting a treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one runs to the coffee shop to make it just before closing, only to find that they decided to close 5 minutes early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

A 56yo male physician comes to the ED complaining of dizziness, fatigue, and some subjective left leg weakness which appears real, but subtle on neurologic exam. His only other history of note is that he recently returned from Haiti, where he performs an annual medical mission trip to treat Haitians who have little access to medical care. He is admitted to the medicine service for workup.

Physical Exam: Normal except as noted above. Heart and lungs sound good, perhaps some bibasilar crackles but nothing outrageous.

Blood Work: Basic labs are unremarkable except for a serum sodium of 132.

CXR: Normal.

They practiced based on at best limited evidence which was only available if you went to the library before every case. I still can't figure out what they were doing working 120+ hours, but I definitely hear about it even as an attending. What the hell were you doing with all that time because you obviously stopped working that hard now.
2. Their pay - They are still paid much higher than I am as a starting physician, and also started higher. Additionally many have pensions that none of the younger physicians will see.
3. Resistant to change - The EMR is bad, someone else needs to do this for me. The new rules are bad, someone stop them. They literally are non-functional without an APP or resident. It's embarrassing. I don't NEED a resident to start a case. They are there to learn. Why do you NEED someone to type three lines in the computer for me.
4. Implications younger surgeons don't work hard enough to be good - this one is self explanatory. I look at the way they practice and think about 50% need to remediate or read more. I am however in no position to say this and usually experience trumps evidence where I work.

His GP was mainly appalled (or at least to his face), but later said ""That's ingenious, but what an idiot."" The dude got his treatments covered and goes to a proper facility now last I heard.

The situation happened some time back, I was helping out a GP, he had appointments in another room. He trusted me quite much, I usually saw patients by myself and asked for his help when I didn't know what to do.

So, there's a lady put into my appointment, GP had assigned an hour of appointment time with her. Oh well, nothing weird, happened all the time, usually with patients with lots of medication and comorbidities. Didn't ring any bells before the appointment. No previous information was also available about that patient, but that wasn't that uncommon either.

I called the patient in, asked what the problem was. Conversation was as follows:

Lady: I came from my acupuncturist, I have been coughing, they told me I have lung chlamydia or mycoplasma and I need antibiotics.

Me: Oh, alright, so we need to evaluate your condition for sure. How long have you been coughing.

Lady: About a year now.

I proceeded to take a detailed history and physical examination. Nothing too interesting. No history of fever, illnesses, only that cough got worse when she was lying down. I noticed though, that jugular veins on the neck were visible when she was standing up.

Me: ""So, we need to take an X-ray now and after that, some blood analyses""

Lady: ""No no no, I just want to take the antibiotics so I can get rid of my cough. I don't want an X ray or blood analyses.""

Me (internally 0.0): We can't prescribe you antibiotics when we are not sure that you really have that problem.

Lady: But my acupuncturist told me I have this! Also I'm so fed up with that cough, I want to start antibiotics today.


I spent the whole hour talking with her about the need of an X ray, and guess what: she did have one finally!

On the X ray there was a widened mediastinum, so she was promptly sent to CT (struma and some mass at right lung), and lung biopsy - she had tuberculosis!


Tl;dr - a patient demanded antibiotics for atypical pneumonia, I refused to write any without an X ray, via X ray it was possible to find out she had tuberculosis.

""I want to thank those of you who alerted us to a document recently released by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) called “CRNAs: We are the Answer.”

I was disappointed to read this malicious statement. However, there is little that’s new here. This is the same recycled, reformatted misinformation the organization has spread for years. We saw it during our campaign to preserve high-quality care in the VA. We saw it in New York last year. We have seen it this year in the seven states where the AANA and its state societies attempted to dismantle existing patient safety standards that ensured patient access to physician-led, team-based models of anesthesia. It didn’t persuade anyone at the VA or in New York or in states like Oklahoma or Arkansas. In each case, physician-delivered and physician-led care was preserved. I commend our members in those states who worked so hard for their patients.

In debate after debate, ASA has successfully responded to the misinformation the AANA foists upon state and federal policymakers. We point out that “nurse anesthesiologist” is a shameless term created to confuse patients. We explain the vast difference in education, skills and training between our medical specialty and nurse anesthetists. We present the fact that the data cited by the AANA to suggest equivalency in care is from brazen, self-funded advocacy studies paid for by the AANA itself. We give policymakers the independent studies that show superior outcomes with the involvement of anesthesiologists. And we are now highlighting that team-based anesthesia is a World Health Organization standard. The AANA and its state societies throw a lot of contempt at our medical specialty. But the good news is that with professionalism and facts, we are winning. And when we win, our patients win.

This AANA document is little more than vitriol. It is about appropriating the name of our medical specialty, disrupting successful team-based models, and ridiculous accusations of “fraud,” “overcompensation” and “barriers.” For ASA and our members, it is all about our patients and what is best for them.

The AANA document simply does not reflect reality. Throughout the country, our members continue to work successfully with nurse anesthetists in a team-based model that frequently also includes anesthesiologist assistants. We are grateful to work with all members of the care team. ASA is committed to preserving and strengthening physician-delivered and physician-led team-based models because that is what is best for our patients. We won’t be distracted from this mission, and I ask that you continue to work with me to preserve our victories and build upon them.

I also want to note that it appears this document is at the center of a larger campaign that the AANA will be unveiling soon. We will have a more detailed response to share with you here and in other member communications as events unfold.

You can read the AANA’s motivation for the document on their website.""

So far, this is a specialty-wide communication, and no ""official statement"" has been made. Of particular concern is the impending ""larger campaign"" from the AANA, and we will have to wait and see exactly what it is.

This week has been a rollercoaster. I started my very first job as a doctor this Monday morning. I got a pager, a phone and a key card and was basically let go to roam free in a hospital I've never been in before, working with a computer system I've never used before and more importantly making decisions about things I've never made before.

I've been stressed, swamped with patients I didn't know what to do with and confused by the system and by how the hospital was organised. All week long a steady stream of nurses have been asking me questions I haven't been able to answer with confidence, at best only mildly annoyed by how slowly I process my patients. Me getting lost on my way to whatever ward or department I'm paged to hasn't helped.

I left the hospital this Friday afternoon, having the luxury of the weekend off, and for the first time this week I've been able to take a step back and process the experience. I've had a large grin on my face since. Despite all the stress, anxiety and self doubt I've experienced this week,  I can't wait to go back on Monday. I love that I'm no longer a med student, with no real responsibility. I love that I get to make decisions and stand by them.

I hadn't gotten any sleep on shift, so I was pretty much a zombie. All I wanted to do was to sneak into the ICU, and sleep on the floor next to some coma patient who wouldn't notice me.

I was just about to finish my shift when EMS radioed in saying that they were transporting an arresting, asystolic 3/yo female, no known medical conditions/disorders, to the ER. CPR was underway, and we were going to need a surgery team ASAP. This was a little weird to me, because usually, if they don't have any medical issues, three-year-olds' hearts don't just stop out of the blue.

So anyway, EMS raced this little kid in on a stretcher into the ER. She was *tiny,* smaller than most normal kids her age. She was unmoving, and the medics were performing CPR one-handed on her. She was completely in the nude, and when I came a little closer, what I saw was horrific.

The kid was COVERED in bruises and long open stab wounds. EMS had tried to bandage them, but they were leaking blood so much that it hadn't helped much. The scene was so horrific that one of our med students actually raced out of the room in panic.

A nurse took over CPR, and I called out for a couple units of blood, and for a team of surgeons to race down here. By this point in time, the kid was asystolic. We gave her some epi, though we didn't think it would do much.

Then, I swear to God, a miracle happened. The heart monitor changed from a flatline to a VF rhythm. We were all going WTF just happened here, because this shit doesn't happen all the time. 

A nurse shocked the kid twice, bringing back the heart rhythm. This in itself was a miracle, but there was little time to celebrate. The surgery team arrived, and they clamped a few bleeding arteries, inserted a chest tube after her lung collapsed in front of them, and stitched her up.

The kid, it turns out, was being raised by her crackhead parents who honestly didn't give a shit about her. The night she was brought in to us, she had wet the bed, and her parents decided to punish her BY BEATING AND STABBING HER UNTIL HER HEART STOPPED. Then, the dad, feeling guilty, called 911, and EMS got her to us.

The girl is currently in the ICU, and is expected to survive (yay!). The demon spawn that are her parents have been arrested, and rumor has it that they are victims of police brutality. I don't blame the cops for that. Hell, if I'd met them personally, I'd probably have killed them myself for what they did to their daughter. People like that don't deserve to be parents.

[UPDATE] (http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/35klrv/why_did_this_have_to_happen/) : So all of this happened ~5 days ago. Today, I went up to the ICU to check on this kid, because so many people were affected by her death, not only at the ER, but also here, on Reddit. And I cleared up a few things, namely, when I said the girl was expected to survive, I meant that her chance of survival was about 40%, miraculously high compared to earlier. 

Unfortunately, like so many others like her, that little girl joined the majority of that statistic.

First up, I just want to say that we tried to save her, all of us. The paramedics raced to the scene, and even before the police came there, they picked up the little girl, breaking the rules and pushing the parents aside. In the ambulance, they performed CPR, intubated her, and started an IV line. In the ER, we did our best. We brought her back from an asystolic state to VF. We shocked her back to a sinus rhythm. We staunched as much blood flow as we could.

The surgeons operated on this little girl right there in the ER. They took her to the ICU, where she received round-the-clock care and assistance. She was given morphine in order for everything to be as painless as possible.

Sadly, that wasn't enough. The damage her bastard parents did to her was too great, and late last night, she succumbed to her injuries. In the moments before she died, she was minimally conscious. One of the nurses in the ICU held her hand as she became unconscious.

I'm typing this at 3am just because this is how I vent out my frustrations. This is how I hold myself together. This is how I stay in my job, striving through each day. Writing is how I do these things.

I'm going to her funeral on Thursday. I'll pay my respects, along with other members of the hospital staff, EMS crew, police officers, total strangers to this girl, and CPS workers. Nobody else will be there, not even an auntie, or a grandma. This just shows you how much this little girl was neglected. Not many people cared for her. And it was only in her last moments that anyone showed some sympathy towards her.

But I shouldn't be going to her funeral. I shouldn't be lighting a candle in her memory, or keeping vigil around her coffin. I should not even know her at all. If someone told authorities what was going on in this little girl's home, her life would have been saved. And people noticed, but they didn't tell. And none of them are or should be going to her funeral.

That's what makes me mad about society.

I've seen too many patients sent to the ED for treatment of their asymptomatic hypertension.  I don't mind seeing your patients on an urgent basis, assuming that you are truly concerned that may have an emergency condition or if you believe they need inpatient treatment.  However, I don't like it when you force patients to come to the ED with scare tactics.

Recently, I've been presented with many patients sent to the ED simply for an elevated blood pressure reading in the absence of any worrisome symptoms or signs.  To make matters worse, these patients have been told a variety of alarmist proclamations, such as: ""you're going to have a stroke,"" ""that's heart attack level blood pressure,"" or ""you're going to have an aneurysm.""  One such patient was actually told that she was having a stroke, based on her blood pressure reading alone in the absence of any focal neurological deficit.  One such patient was actually ""stroke alerted"" by my triage nurse (despite not having any true neurological complaints), which caused a tremendous waste of time and resources, not to mention the potential for harm to the patient.

Naturally, these patients are terrified.  They trust their outpatient physician and are skeptical when I tell them that hypertension is just a number.  It takes a lot of time and effort to talk these patients down and help them recognize the actual importance of long term control of their blood pressure.  Many are slow to understand the idea that a rapid drop in their blood pressure is more likely to cause an actual stroke and that a high blood pressure alone is not going to cause a stroke in the short term.

If you are actually concerned that your patient is suffering from a ""hypertensive emergency"", please send them directly to the ED.  (There is no such entity as ""hypertensive urgency."")  That's why we exist.  However, please don't use the ED as an ""easy button"" to avoid actual assessment of your patient or to avoid a conversation with your patient.  It's easy enough to find out if the patient is suffering from any symptoms that might be attributable to a hypertensive emergency; if they are not, and there are no focal neurological deficits, then it is safe for you to refer that patient to their primary care physician for sane and rational treatment of their essential hypertension.  If you are a primary care physician yourself, it's pretty simple to ascertain whether or not it is safe to manage that patient's hypertension in clinic with a few minutes of interview on the phone.  Hypertensive emergencies are not subtle; their manifestations are dramatic.

If you are in doubt, feel free to send these patients to the ED for evaluation.  However, please do not dramatize the risks.  No one is going to have a stroke because they delayed treatment of their hypertension by a few days, weeks, or months.  No one will have a heart attack if they delay starting HCTZ by a fortnight.  Your patient is not going to have a brain aneurysm in the next hour, even if their systolic is 200.  (Coincidentally, most of the asymptomatic hypertension patients I see are sent to the ED because their systolic is greater than 200 or their diastolic is greater than 100; funny how 190 seems so much less threatening than 202.)  When you terrify your patient, you make my job much harder because I have to talk them back down from the cliff while also trying to encourage them into taking their chronic asymptomatic hypertension seriously.

In case you're thinking it--no, a headache is not a sign of ""end-organ damage.""  A headache with focal neurological deficits or decreased level of consciousness may be, but a simple tension or migraine headache is not.  Please dig a little deeper in the history before you tell a patient that they are going to die from their headache and that they need immediate emergency department care.  

Patients ought to be sent to the ED based on their symptoms, not isolated numbers.  Someone with a BP of 88/40 who is afebrile, alert, oriented, and well appearing is probably not in shock but rather has a small upper arm.  An otherwise asymptomatic and healthy adult with cold fingers and an SpO2 of 88% is probably not dying.  An athlete with a resting pulse of 40 BPM is not in symptomatic bradycardia.  The otherwise healthy young man with a partial RBBB observed on his ECG is not in heart failure.  The patient who was incidentally found to have a 13K WBC on routine labs is not in sepsis.  The guy with an oral temperature of 94.4F that was obtained after drinking cold water does not have hypothermia.  In each case, we keep the clinical scenario in mind when interpreting the data.  Blood pressure is no different.

I understand when a patient themselves freaks out at a high blood pressure reading or when a ""nurse line"" instructs a patient to come to the ED for their asymptomatic hypertension.  In those cases, no one who knows better is present to weigh the evidence and offer medical advice.  However, when I see a patient referred by an actual physician for asymptomatic hypertension, it disheartens me.  As doctors, regardless of our specialty, we should know better and we should take the time to actually assess our patients.  This is something that everyone who went to medical school ought to know, regardless of your specialty.  You don't need to keep up to date on the latest in blood pressure management or other primary care topics, but you ought to understand the difference between a true ""hypertensive emergency"" and asymptomatic hypertension.  

In conclusion, please take the time to actually assess your patients and be honest with them.  A few minutes of additional history, even over the phone, can save countless hours of a patient's otherwise wasted time, the efforts of emergency department staff, thousands of wasted dollars in resources, and, most importantly, your patient's mental anguish.  If you just want me to start your patient on HCTZ for their essential hypertension because your clinic is booked out three months in advance, go ahead and send them to me, but please don't terrify your patient with the idea that they are going to stroke out unless they are treated immediately.  (I want to add that the worst offenders are not primary care doctors, but rather specialists and proceduralists who don't know what to do with hypertensive patients.) 
 Don't do this for me or my nurses--do it for the sake of your patients and their trust in you (you're going to look silly after they learn from me that their brain isn't going to explode due to their asymptomatic hypertension, regardless of the number).  

Thank you for humoring my long winded rant.

(As an aside, I hate the term ""hypertensive emergency"" just as much as ""hypertensive urgency.""  It makes it seem like the blood pressure is the primary problem, when it is not.  ""Hypertensive emergency"" just means a medical condition in which blood pressure management is an important consideration.  You cannot have an ""hypertensive emergency"" without the underlying emergency condition, such as an aortic dissection, aneurysmal SAH, acute heart failure, renal failure, eclampsia, brain herniation, or stroke.  The disease that gets closest to an actual ""hypertensive emergency"" is malignant hypertension, which is a rare presentation seemingly driven by the elevation in blood pressure.  In all others, the hypertension is driven by the underlying pathology.)

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to speak out to the community in order to get something off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen too many patients sent to the ED for treatment of their asymptomatic hypertension.  I don&amp;#39;t mind seeing your patients on an urgent basis, assuming that you are truly concerned that may have an emergency condition or if you believe they need inpatient treatment.  However, I don&amp;#39;t like it when you force patients to come to the ED with scare tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been presented with many patients sent to the ED simply for an elevated blood pressure reading in the absence of any worrisome symptoms or signs.  To make matters worse, these patients have been told a variety of alarmist proclamations, such as: &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re going to have a stroke,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s heart attack level blood pressure,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re going to have an aneurysm.&amp;quot;  One such patient was actually told that she was having a stroke, based on her blood pressure reading alone in the absence of any focal neurological deficit.  One such patient was actually &amp;quot;stroke alerted&amp;quot; by my triage nurse (despite not having any true neurological complaints), which caused a tremendous waste of time and resources, not to mention the potential for harm to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, these patients are terrified.  They trust their outpatient physician and are skeptical when I tell them that hypertension is just a number.  It takes a lot of time and effort to talk these patients down and help them recognize the actual importance of long term control of their blood pressure.  Many are slow to understand the idea that a rapid drop in their blood pressure is more likely to cause an actual stroke and that a high blood pressure alone is not going to cause a stroke in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are actually concerned that your patient is suffering from a &amp;quot;hypertensive emergency&amp;quot;, please send them directly to the ED.  (There is no such entity as &amp;quot;hypertensive urgency.&amp;quot;)  That&amp;#39;s why we exist.  However, please don&amp;#39;t use the ED as an &amp;quot;easy button&amp;quot; to avoid actual assessment of your patient or to avoid a conversation with your patient.  It&amp;#39;s easy enough to find out if the patient is suffering from any symptoms that might be attributable to a hypertensive emergency; if they are not, and there are no focal neurological deficits, then it is safe for you to refer that patient to their primary care physician for sane and rational treatment of their essential hypertension.  If you are a primary care physician yourself, it&amp;#39;s pretty simple to ascertain whether or not it is safe to manage that patient&amp;#39;s hypertension in clinic with a few minutes of interview on the phone.  Hypertensive emergencies are not subtle; their manifestations are dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in doubt, feel free to send these patients to the ED for evaluation.  However, please do not dramatize the risks.  No one is going to have a stroke because they delayed treatment of their hypertension by a few days, weeks, or months.  No one will have a heart attack if they delay starting HCTZ by a fortnight.  Your patient is not going to have a brain aneurysm in the next hour, even if their systolic is 200.  (Coincidentally, most of the asymptomatic hypertension patients I see are sent to the ED because their systolic is greater than 200 or their diastolic is greater than 100; funny how 190 seems so much less threatening than 202.)  When you terrify your patient, you make my job much harder because I have to talk them back down from the cliff while also trying to encourage them into taking their chronic asymptomatic hypertension seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#39;re thinking it--no, a headache is not a sign of &amp;quot;end-organ damage.&amp;quot;  A headache with focal neurological deficits or decreased level of consciousness may be, but a simple tension or migraine headache is not.  Please dig a little deeper in the history before you tell a patient that they are going to die from their headache and that they need immediate emergency department care.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients ought to be sent to the ED based on their symptoms, not isolated numbers.  Someone with a BP of 88/40 who is afebrile, alert, oriented, and well appearing is probably not in shock but rather has a small upper arm.  An otherwise asymptomatic and healthy adult with cold fingers and an SpO2 of 88% is probably not dying.  An athlete with a resting pulse of 40 BPM is not in symptomatic bradycardia.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, something new happened that made me totally forget how bad my saturday was. 

There was a troublesome patient that was  assigned to me today. Met him for the first time. I went to see him and  he immediately demanded pain medications. I said without properly  assessing you, it will not be the best practice to give you pain  medication as it might negatively impact your health. At this point, he  became verbally abusive, including calling me a ""Mother F-word B-word  Ass N-word P-word"" and a combination of those words repeatedly, after  accusing all doctors to be greedy.

I  insisted him to be polite, and asked him to cooperate, at which point he  threatened me that I would pay for this and to suck his D , among other  abuses. Till this time, its pretty much another day at the hospital, so  I wasnt too bothered by it.

When i asked him to cooperate again, he upped his rhetoric and this is what he said in exact words -

**""I  am gonna do my homework, find out where you live and send 40 Mother  F-word N-word to your home to kill your family in the night""**

At  which point, I just left the room, called security and escorted the pt  out. I wrote a detailed note in the chart, emailed my supervisors.

I  later called city police and asked to file a report. The cop took my  statement and asked his detective, who said, its not a felony yet, but  you can go to the DA office and file a Private Criminal Complaint and  gave me a report number and state crime victim compensation form.

I  am usually not too concerned about these threats, but because he laid  out his threat so specifically and detailed manner, it does make me a  little concerned. He is almost 45 year old, and large built, so it will  not be unusual if he jumps in a parking lot or has me followed to my  home. I am also surprised that the detective thought it was not  significant enough to do something about it. One of my friend told me to  get a restraining order but it would entail me giving out my exact home  address to him , which frankly is stupid because he wont come himself  but can send anyone else to hurt me.

In a mysterious out of session period, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill that would legitimize naturopathy in the state. The bill is now sitting on the governors desk. He could do nothing and let the bill expire on Jan. 13, or he could codify the pseudoscientific health fraud that is naturopathy into state law.

You can reach Gov. Charlie Baker at 617-725-4005.

Key points to explain to the governor's aides:

* Naturopaths do not attend medical school, but are trained in medical pseudoscience, such as homeopathy.
* Naturopaths consistently misrepresent their medical abilities.
* Naturopaths do not have effective or safe methods for treating chronic pain.
* Naturopaths seek licensure to fight for mandatory insurance reimbursement for their services, which would inflate wasteful healthcare spending
* Naturopaths seeking licensure claim they are safer practitioners than other kinds of naturopaths, but there is no discernible difference. All naturopaths practice using pseudoscientific methods that have been disproven and shunned by medical professions for causing patient harm.

“I'd like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.

She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.

/1
She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.

Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.

Sepsis. Fixable enough.

/2
But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.

Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.

/3
A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.

(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)

She underwent stenting and returned home.

/4

Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.

It was now infected, and that was a big problem.

/5

We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.

But then came the big question: “Now what?”

/6
She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that. 

But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.

The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.

/7
We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.
 
Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.

/8
Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.

Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.

/9
She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.

No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.

She wasn’t interested in living like that.

/10
We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.

She wasn’t interested in dying like that.

/11
She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).

/12
We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.

They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.

So that became the plan.

/13
I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.

Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.

/14
After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.

I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.

(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)

/15
A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.

There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.

They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.

/16
I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.

“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.

“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”

/17
She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.

Next came propofol, an anaesthetic.
Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant.
Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.

Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.

/18
There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.

/19
I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.

This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.

/20
We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I'll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.

And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.

Like many here, I’ve seen peaceful and gruesome passings. But, having the ability and control to choose your time and place at the end of life and leave this world with grace should be a right of everyone. Also, the allergies are really bad today...

EDIT:

Here are a few resources and information regarding MAiD/VAD/Death with Dignity:

USA: https://www.deathwithdignity.org
Canada:https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/medical-assistance-dying.html
Australia: https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/voluntary-assisted-dying
Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg allow for MAiD

If you have other resources, please share!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posted from @DavidJuurlink (&lt;a href=""https://twitter.com/davidjuurlink/status/1129811903776198659?s=21""&gt;https://twitter.com/davidjuurlink/status/1129811903776198659?s=21&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;#39;d like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/1
She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sepsis. Fixable enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/2
But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/3
A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She underwent stenting and returned home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now infected, and that was a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then came the big question: “Now what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/6
She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/7
We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/8
Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/9
She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t interested in living like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/10
We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t interested in dying like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/11
She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/12
We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that became the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/13
I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/14
After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/15
A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/16
I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/17
She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next came propofol, an anaesthetic.
Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant.
Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/18
There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/19
I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/20
We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I&amp;#39;ll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/ end”&lt;/p&gt;

I know many pediatric subspecialties go underfilled, and some research suggests that many fellowships are financially net negative decisions (&lt;a href=""https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/2/254""&gt;https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/2/254&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them are celebrities, some of them billionaires. What I have noticed about this patient population is the ""care"" can be VERY wrong to the point where sometimes I have pity for them. I know it seems hard to believe but let me explain.

1) Polypharmacy:
The high end, big donor patient has trouble sleeping... Here's a sleeping pill. They have anxiety... Here's Xanax. They have pain... Here's Vicodin. The threshold for being aggressive about symptoms is very low because if that important person feels like they aren't getting service, they go somewhere else. That's why I see so many young, well to do people with long lists of meds and along with that diagnoses like fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome to justify them and higher opiate and benzo tolerance.

2) Overly Aggressive Care:
The combination of wanting to show off expensive toys to your wealthy patients, look more prestigious, bill them generously and reduce liability by overscreening in a population with big pockets for lawyers leads to a lot of questionable behavior.  I've seen knee jerk bronchoscopies for bronchitis, laryngoscopy for a sore throat, coronary CT scans for young people with no risk factors and mild costochondritis, annual whole body CT scans and the finding of the inevitable incidentalomas that then require follow-up biopsy which then have their own host of complications.  If a doctor wants to cover their butt on a high end client, they will order a ton of labs and inevitably some come back false positive and the doctor freaks out about a borderline ANA and gives steroids or borderline elevated TSH in a patient who has fatigue and prescribes Synthroid. If the patient has a small nodule on CT and the guidelines say follow-up imaging in 6 months, the doctor calls up his CT surgeon friend to proceed directly to VATs. The doctor says to their patient ""don't worry. I got this. We'll use a fiberoptic camera, small incisions and you'll be cured before it has a chance of becoming something serious."" The doctor then becomes the hero.

3) No Deescalation of Care:
It goes without saying that if your high end client is on a treatment or given a diagnosis, you will be very reluctant to stop or reclassify a diagnosis as a misdiagnosis. More sad and much more devastating to see is the reluctance for deescalation from the ICU; so many prolonged admits in patients with end stage diagnoses and I was forbidden from consulting Palliative Care. Their high end MDs treated giving a bad prognosis to a high end patient and their family like giving bad news to Saddam Hussein. At the same time, these doctors overexaggerated the seriousness of conditions, the challenges of management, to look amazing when things turned around for the good.

4) Can't Say No:
When the doctor of a celebrity is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to be their private doc and that celebrity says ""I have the worst insomnia and the last time I think I slept well was after that cosmetic surgery when they gave me propofol. Why don't we just use that?"" ""Uh... sure Michael, I'll place an IV and I guess I'll monitor it myself. No problem."" The wealthy like to Google things and then demand that and the doctor doesn't want to say no. People forget that Steve Jobs had the fortunately CURABLE form of pancreatic cancer but decided there was a holistic herbal regimen he wanted to try instead of chemo and though I can't say his Oncologist didn't try to say ""no, that's a bad idea,"" but I'm just saying I've seen how hard it is for doctors to say no to their high end clients and fall out of their favor.

5) All Roads Lead to Doctor:
If you have pain, soreness, I have the remedy in the form of a pill. You don't need to suck it up.  If you're overweight, I'll get the lap band for you and you won't need to diet.  We don't need to figure out why you're tired all the time. Won't screen for depression. Take some growth hormone and testosterone and you'll feel great. Instead of the patient being self reliant, the doctor slowly creates a situation where their wealthy client DEPENDS on them to solve their problems. It's like when a wealthy patient says ""I have the greatest doctor! He is the absolute greatest"" I'm always thinking in the back of my head ""is that because he completely suckered you into his facade of being the high end, beautiful officed, Armani suite wearing guy who solves all your problems for you?""

Why am I talking about this? Maybe you don't feel sorry for the massive list of celebrities and wealthy people who die of prescription overdoses, and ridiculous care... well maybe we should because as medical professionals we need to have sympathy for ALL PEOPLE.  But, more to the point, the ideas here probably resonate with all doctors practicing in all demographics in the US.  It is what we see in ourselves that we hate the most but amplified as the stakes go up. It's what we hate the most about operating in a high liability environment, overly defensive medicine and the perils of for profit care that caters to money and sacrifices our medical training to the false god of prestige.  The problem is never the fresh eyed, new medical graduate full of idealism who then understands in the first years of medicine the major limitations of the job of being a physician, what can realistically be medically achieved, but the physician who then becomes cynical and uses his/her position to cultivate an unrealistic persona to charm clients, to endear themselves to them and depend on them, the doctor who makes a living selling themselves rather than their quality of medical care.  It is a major dilemma of our profession and one that is amplified in the highest reaches of money and power.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the facilities I trained at caters to the elites of this world.

The doctor says to their patient &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry. I got this. We&amp;#39;ll use a fiberoptic camera, small incisions and you&amp;#39;ll be cured before it has a chance of becoming something serious.&amp;quot; The doctor then becomes the hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) No Deescalation of Care:
It goes without saying that if your high end client is on a treatment or given a diagnosis, you will be very reluctant to stop or reclassify a diagnosis as a misdiagnosis. More sad and much more devastating to see is the reluctance for deescalation from the ICU; so many prolonged admits in patients with end stage diagnoses and I was forbidden from consulting Palliative Care. Their high end MDs treated giving a bad prognosis to a high end patient and their family like giving bad news to Saddam Hussein. At the same time, these doctors overexaggerated the seriousness of conditions, the challenges of management, to look amazing when things turned around for the good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Can&amp;#39;t Say No:
When the doctor of a celebrity is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to be their private doc and that celebrity says &amp;quot;I have the worst insomnia and the last time I think I slept well was after that cosmetic surgery when they gave me propofol. Why don&amp;#39;t we just use that?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Uh... sure Michael, I&amp;#39;ll place an IV and I guess I&amp;#39;ll monitor it myself. No problem.&amp;quot; The wealthy like to Google things and then demand that and the doctor doesn&amp;#39;t want to say no. People forget that Steve Jobs had the fortunately CURABLE form of pancreatic cancer but decided there was a holistic herbal regimen he wanted to try instead of chemo and though I can&amp;#39;t say his Oncologist didn&amp;#39;t try to say &amp;quot;no, that&amp;#39;s a bad idea,&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;m just saying I&amp;#39;ve seen how hard it is for doctors to say no to their high end clients and fall out of their favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) All Roads Lead to Doctor:
If you have pain, soreness, I have the remedy in the form of a pill. You don&amp;#39;t need to suck it up.  If you&amp;#39;re overweight, I&amp;#39;ll get the lap band for you and you won&amp;#39;t need to diet.  We don&amp;#39;t need to figure out why you&amp;#39;re tired all the time. Won&amp;#39;t screen for depression. Take some growth hormone and testosterone and you&amp;#39;ll feel great. Instead of the patient being self reliant, the doctor slowly creates a situation where their wealthy client DEPENDS on them to solve their problems. It&amp;#39;s like when a wealthy patient says &amp;quot;I have the greatest doctor! He is the absolute greatest&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m always thinking in the back of my head &amp;quot;is that because he completely suckered you into his facade of being the high end, beautiful officed, Armani suite wearing guy who solves all your problems for you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I talking about this? Maybe you don&amp;#39;t feel sorry for the massive list of celebrities and wealthy people who die of prescription overdoses, and ridiculous care... well maybe we should because as medical professionals we need to have sympathy for ALL PEOPLE.  But, more to the point, the ideas here probably resonate with all doctors practicing in all demographics in the US.  It is what we see in ourselves that we hate the most but amplified as the stakes go up. It&amp;#39;s what we hate the most about operating in a high liability environment, overly defensive medicine and the perils of for profit care that caters to money and sacrifices our medical training to the false god of prestige.  The problem is never the fresh eyed, new medical graduate full of idealism who then understands in the first years of medicine the major limitations of the job of being a physician, what can realistically be medically achieved, but the physician who then becomes cynical and uses his/her position to cultivate an unrealistic persona to charm clients, to endear themselves to them and depend on them, the doctor who makes a living selling themselves rather than their quality of medical care.  It is a major dilemma of our profession and one that is amplified in the highest reaches of money and power.&lt;/p&gt;

I initially went into family because of the breadth and challenge of seeing undifferentiated patients and working them up as well as having that longitudinal relationship.

Now into my residency, I feel like I either lied to myself or was grossly misled about the specialty. Most patients come in, anxious with non specific complaints that I'm forced to go through the mental exercise of coming up with a differential for, that end up being nothing. Cannot tell you all the useless bloodwork/tests that are done just to ease their anxiety.

My preceptors are not overly knowledgeable either. Most of the time if I don't know what it is, they don't know and end up referring so I never make that mental connection with a presentation and end diagnosis even if it theoretically should be pretty simple. Some of the referrals that I've been forced to make are almost laughable. I am not learning any medicine or pathophysiology.

At least once a day, I am met with a patient who presents with a list of bloodwork that some herbalist/naturopath/chiropractor wants them to do. I know fully well that these ""professionals"" are unable to interpret the results or do anything with them other than make up a treatment. Yet my role as a family doctor in those instances just gets devalued down to  being a puppet for people who don't even have ordering rights.

The worst part is no matter how rude patients are to me, I am always expected to maintain professionalism or bend over backwards to ""maintain rapport"".

What am I doing here? I did not go to med school to not know medicine, to constantly reassure anxious people, or to work FOR pseudoscientists.

I arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.

A nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open.

He’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.

My shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.

A life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile.

An older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.

“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”

The nurse starts circulating, instructing people she doesn’t recognize to leave. I’m fully gowned with a mask, but I know this won't protect me. As she nears, I turn to the trauma cart and pretend that I’m seeking some device which will be useful in the near future. She passes and I turn back, an escapee.

The patient is rolled in and movement starts. Intubation, CPR - but within minutes it is determined that yes, this is most certainly futile, and the patient's time of death is called.

I walk back to my ED section to receive sign-outs. The attending looks up warmly:

“Welcome to the Emergency Department, Dr. Wtffng.”

There are three Interns, one PA, and one Attending. The attending looks around and wonders aloud “Do we have no senior here? No? Looks like a busy day.”

We’ve been informed that as interns our expectation for these first shifts are simply this: Do an HPI. Learn the system. Be honest.

I haven’t done an EM shift in 2 years now, and my excitement is tempered by the growing realization that after 8+ years of education, I might know nothing.

I push back against this thinking and set to work as the clock strikes 07:00. I look up at the patient board and see red rapidly disappearing as the team logins to the EHR. I scan the list and pick up the first one I see- a seizure.

The patient’s from out of town, no history available. No worries, I’ve done seizure work-ups plenty of times in the past, right?

As I walk towards the room the nurse pulls back the curtain and exits.

“Hi! I’m WTF, the intern working with you today for the first time here.” We exchange formalities and he is kind. He’s patient. I ask him to let me know if he needs anything and what he thinks about the patient.

So here it goes. The first patient seen with an MD straggling along behind my name.

“Hello, I’m WTF FNG, call me WTF. I’m the resident doctor taking care of you this morning.”

The patient is younger. Engaged. Smart. Here for work and he certainly knows more about seizures than I do. He informs me he’s got important things to do, and he hasn’t slept well the last couple nights and had a couple drinks the previous- likely the cause.

I do an HPI and order labs. I’m trying to contact an outpatient neurologist in some far away state who I soon realize doesn’t want to respond to pages sent from East Coast Time.

I pick up another patient, dizziness. I whisk into the room to find a pleasant older woman who is here only because her son was concerned. She’s got important things to do, and wants to escape this place to her cabin for the weekend.

I tidy up things for my first patient and discharge him. He looks at me says “Hey- Thank you, that was really quick and thorough.”

I laugh and respond “Hey I appreciate that. Don’t tell anyone on your way out- but it’s my first day as a doctor.”

I smile, shake his hand and leave before I can see if his face drops into disappointment. I exit the room to find the nurse standing there, obviously overhearing this statement, with an expression somewhere between amusement and scorn.

I am admitting the woman with dizziness and break the news that she likely won’t be making it to her cabin this weekend. There’s soft pushback. I explain that if she were my mother I’d want her to stay in the hospital for further evaluation, and I would.

There’s a small pause and I blurt out “if you want, you can call me Dr. WTF FNG, RUINER OF WEEKENDS. I propose a weekend of awful hospital food and cable TV rather than a relaxing weekend at the cabin.”
She stares at me for a moment, and begins to laugh. She agrees to stay. I exit the room again to find the nurse holding onto an expression somewhere between concern and breaking laughter.

These damn curtains. I speak loudly and everyone can hear my weak passes at wit.

I step backwards onto a small neurologist who has somehow snuck behind me. He does not feel that another patient of mine warrants a neurological consult but he’s already here in the ED and he’s trapped. Success. A tap on my shoulder saves me from the debate and I set to fix one of the many problems I’ve created from bumbling through the EHR.

I don’t know how to document properly for billing, admit correctly for admissions, and discharge sufficiently to get the patient out. The PA is a saint. Seriously. Every question is answered patiently, from phone numbers to drug dosing. My attending, also up for canonization- is juggling every patient in the section while teaching three interns. The nurses are supportive, and graceful as they inform me of each small misstep and how to fix it. I can tell I'm slowing them down, but they're as understanding as over-worked nurses can afford to be, and I'm damn appreciative of this.

I sit and try to catch up on non-existent notes and again my shoulder is tapped as I’m halfway through a sent-

“That’s you.” The nurse informs me.

“What?” I respond confusedly.

“Trauma to Bay 4.”

“What?”

“You. That’s you. Go to Trauma Bay 4.”

It clicks. Those overhead pages now address me at this time.

The rest of my shift blows by, fueled by pretzels and coffee. I see the sick and ill alongside the worried well. I witness the aftermath of tragedy that will surface darkly in the newspaper days later.

Each time I sit to chart, my phone rings or my shoulder is tapped. I incorrectly place and fix orders. I am slow. I feel I know nothing. Things that went so fast as a medical student take longer now, and are so much more complex. There was no magic click or growth following the MD that was placed behind my name a month ago. I am still just me, with the same knowledge base. As I work I realize the auditioning medical students likely, or perhaps certainly- know more than me.

I can feel hard in my gut that I don’t have a flow, nor method to manage the tasks constantly flooding me. My shift ends and I melt into a chair in the resident workroom to catch up on my mangled notes.

Two senior residents slide into the room and flop down on the couch. They are on an off-service rotation and enjoying the periodic downtime and freedom.

“So how’d it go?”

I explain my concerns about flow and knowledge, pace and expectations.
They laugh.

“It comes with time. You guys are doing great, seriously. It’s a whole new approach and we all do it a little differently. In a couple months you’ll be managing all of this and more with ease.”

They pause and one asks “So what did you think?”

I sit for a second and scan my hazy memory of the past 9 hours. For a moment my gut relaxes.

“It was awesome. I made the right choice.”

They laugh.

“wtf, Welcome to Emergency Medicine.”","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preface: I shared this with &lt;a href=""/r/medicalschool""&gt;/r/medicalschool&lt;/a&gt; and I wanted to share it here with &lt;a href=""/r/medicine""&gt;/r/medicine&lt;/a&gt; as well. I have changed certain presentations and details to maintain relative anonymity. I wanted to share this narrative to let people see my perspective as a new EM intern. It is long, so please- feel free to ignore it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-wtffng&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba

 had just returned from maternity leave and on her first day was put on call. She was a registrar, who by all accounts was competent safe and hardworking but had been off clinical work for a year. There were supposed to be 2 doctors of her seniority working that shift, in fact it was just her. During that shift a young patient came into hospital unwell. That child deteriorated and subsequently arrested. There was a brief moment of confusion when Dr Bawa-Garba halted the cardiac arrest team, having mistaken the patient for another child who was DNR, however the mistake was realised and resuscitation attempts were re-commenced (although the court recognised that this did not have a bearing on the death).


During the court case for manslaughter it was revealed that the ward was understaffed with both nurses and doctors, that the IT system was down, meaning that results were delivered in an unusual way, and that during handover, the consultant on call had been made aware of the patient's extremely abnormal ABG, showing marked acidaemia. He later stated that because the result was not emphasised to him, he had missed its importance.

Aftre the death, as is usual in the UK, Dr Bawa-Garba met with her supervisor and composed a reflection on events - these are intended to guide one's education and personal/professional development. This reflection was placed into the doctor's electronic training portfolio. The court subsequently ordered release of this reflection, which was used against her in court, in violation of the intended use.

Dr Bawa-Garba was given a suspended jail sentence, and was also subject to discipline by the GMC (the body that issues licences to practice to UK doctors). She appeared before the MPTS - Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service- and was suspended for 12 months. The GMC appealed in court against this decision, asking for a stronger sanction.

This incident appears to have been the sole blemish on an otherwise exemplary career and training - Dr Bawa-Garba continued to work for several years after the patient death until the court case with no concerns raised.

The court allowed this appeal, thus opening Dr Bawa-Garba to more severe sanctions, and more worryingly, while acknowledging the system safety failures that occured, said that these had no bearing or relevance to the fact that a mistake was made.


This case is groundbreaking in the UK. read the article, and research the details of the case and if you are a doctor in the UK, be very afraid...

I’ve been practicing as a pharmacist for about a year and a half at this point and wanted to hear from prescribers their perspective on continual monthly prescribing of narcotics/benzos. I see these as two different but linked issues, but will address them differently.

Benzos: When I see a patient on straight Xanax 1-2 mg TID, with no other supportive psych meds, a huge red flag shoots up. My understanding is for the vast majority of situations, benzos should not be the backbone of therapy for anxiety. SSRI/SNRI and/or buspirone should be the backbone (I know there are other pharmacological classes like bupropion that can be tried as well). However time after time I see benzos dished out like candy. I spent about 30 mins talking to a patient yesterday about her therapy and she said her appointments consist of her coming in, her doc asking if she takes her meds and if things are ok, and then writing a script for more Xanax. Why isn’t there an active attempt to deescalate to a safer agent? Is there a fear the patient won’t come back? Is there just too much hassle?

Opioids: Dear god the amount of issues revolved around opioids are enough to make a sane man crazy. I have multiple patients that will call starting about a week out for their next fill of hydrocodone and ask daily “When can I get it? When did I get it last? Can I get it early (I fill 2 days early already), did the doctor send it in?” This will repeat monthly. I’m just curious if they call y’all the same amount. Anyways, I have some patient with obvious pain issues or cancer patients, this is not about them. This about the able bodied 40 year old dudes that have been unemployed for a decade and have nothing better than to try to score narcs. Why continue writing for them 1 q 4h prn QD? Why is there no plan to deescalate? I’ve seen some theorize that this type of prescribing is an easy guaranteed pay check every month because these patients will come back for their “appointments”. I’m hoping this isn’t true.

To summarize my questions:

Why are benzos used so commonly as monotherapy for anxiety?

Why do I never see any attempt (besides 1 patient who underwent successful surgery), to deescalate opioids?

The patients with obvious drug seeking behavior. What do you do to put a stop to it?

I hope none of this came out accusatory. I honestly want to hear your side. I have a corresponding responsibility as a pharmacist, and believe me I have refused to fill and dismissed patients who refuse to follow pain management/psych plans. But ultimately they can just walk down the street and fill elsewhere.

But what's more fun is when memaw is a COPD exacerbation and you're trying to wean her off the nasal cannula. You work all day and get her satting at 94% at 1L. Come back the next day to find the oxygen fairy came through last night and cranked it to 6L to get her satting 100%...and sho' 'nuff the chart says RR 18.

So, please, count or don't chart. Also, don't mess with oxygen unless the pt is symptomatic. Memaw thanks you. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excuse me, nurse...&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to thank you folks for doing what you do, especially under the the current environment. A physician that spent too much time on me, has terrible patient review for idiotic reasons, and tells me at least one attorney joke per visit, completely changed my life years ago. He sure as hell didn't need someone telling him how to do his job. I would be devastated if he burned out. I definitely didn't want this post to in any way deter someone from medicine as a career.

I don't think non-medical professionals, including myself, have any business dictating the way you practice medicine. I'd be happy to share some insights from my evil litigator perspective about how you might fight back, none of which involve litigation if anyone is interested. I definitely think there's hope if there's collective will to do something about it.

I was never worried about him.  I don't think anyone did.

And that's what makes all of this so hard for me.  Yesterday he returned to the hospital.  He never made it back to us because he died of a medication overdose in the micu, on the medication I sent him home with.  A medication he wouldn't have if not for me.

  If I didn't notice with him, how am I going to notice with the next patient, with any of my patients?  What the hell am I even doing?

Excuse me for my poor intern sleep deprived stream of consciousness. 

It's starting to hit me that the roughest part is that you can't really walk away cause that means someone could die. 
In other jobs, when you're fed up, you can just say screw it, I'll get back to it when I feel more up to it. And in some other jobs, even if you don't, it'll eventually be okay cause at least it's not the end of the world for someone. Not the case for medicine. Knowing the buck stops at you can be overwhelming sometimes. I'm glad I'm still training and I have backup, but man, does it sometimes hit hard. And it's harder when you know maybe the best thing to do is to stop - that you've hit the limits of what medicine can provide - but you're still obligated to do so because we as a society haven't really come to terms with dying gracefully. And even rougher still is wanting to mourn the loss of a life with the family and your coworkers, but work pulls you in a thousand other different directions because you still have to make sure you give it your all for all the others you are responsible for.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the family of my patient who died today - I&amp;#39;m sorry what we had to give wasn&amp;#39;t enough.

So instead I cried while writing my notes and finishing up work I had been unable to do the rest of the day because I spent most of the day trying to keep your loved one alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead I&amp;#39;ll say it here: to the family of my patient who died today - I&amp;#39;m sorry, and know that I cried for your loved one too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excuse me for my poor intern sleep deprived stream of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s starting to hit me that the roughest part is that you can&amp;#39;t really walk away cause that means someone could die. 
In other jobs, when you&amp;#39;re fed up, you can just say screw it, I&amp;#39;ll get back to it when I feel more up to it. And in some other jobs, even if you don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;ll eventually be okay cause at least it&amp;#39;s not the end of the world for someone. Not the case for medicine. Knowing the buck stops at you can be overwhelming sometimes. I&amp;#39;m glad I&amp;#39;m still training and I have backup, but man, does it sometimes hit hard. And it&amp;#39;s harder when you know maybe the best thing to do is to stop - that you&amp;#39;ve hit the limits of what medicine can provide - but you&amp;#39;re still obligated to do so because we as a society haven&amp;#39;t really come to terms with dying gracefully. And even rougher still is wanting to mourn the loss of a life with the family and your coworkers, but work pulls you in a thousand other different directions because you still have to make sure you give it your all for all the others you are responsible for.&lt;/p&gt;

A mum brought her 3 year old boy to our family clinic the other day. I had never met either of them before. As they walked in I could see that the child appeared well (good color, no shortness of breath, walked in normally and sat down, said 'hi' and was smiling). Because of how well he seemed I relaxed.

Mum opens by saying that the kid has ""croup"" and needs prednisolone.

Ok I thought. What does the ""cough sound like?""

""It's a seal-like barking cough"", she states.

I thought that was a bit odd and that she must have heard it from a doctor at some point. I got the rest of the history from them. In summary he had a runny nose for a few days and then starting with a dry ""seal-like barking cough"" had started infrequently over the last 24 hours. No stridor or shortness of breath. No fevers and was eating and drinking well.

I then examined the child and apart from a runny nose everything was normal: Appears well, no stridor, good hydration, vitals normal including temperature, no meningism, ears and throat looked normal, chest clear. The only thing was a bit of a runny nose. I did not witness a single cough during the 20 minutes they were there.

I then spent about 15 minutes discussing about how I thought there was a *possibility* that this wasn't croup and that maybe she was interpreting a regular cough as a croupy cough. My plan was to treat this conservatively with rest, fluids and acetaminophen and have them return or go to emergency if he was starting to get worse - particularly if he developed shortness of breath/stridor. She didn't take this too well and in the end we agreed on a backpocket script for pred that she could take home and give him if he started to get worse.

The next day I received a formal complaint from her about me with all kinds of accusations like I was putting her child in harm's way by not giving the pred, not knowing what croup was, by seeming that I made her feel unwelcome that she was even there (in reality I was stunned at how she yelled at this kid to sit down when they arrived). During the consult she also punched the kid in the arm hard with a closed fist because he wriggled in his chair a bit (ADHD) - but that is not the topic of this post.

During my time writing a response to the complaint, I went back through all of the notes that we had on this child. In his 3 years of life he had been brought to our clinic almost 50 times with some variation of viral illnesses - runny noses, AOM, viral induced wheeze etc and had received approximately 20 courses of antibiotics. Looking through the notes I also found that the child has also been given **12** courses of prednisolone for croup. Every single instance was the same: mum brought in child saying he has a ""seal-like barking cough"", he looks completely well to the doctors, sometimes a mild non-croupy cough was heard but never any stridor and vitals and examination always normal except for sometimes a mild fever.

For the next three months I looked down several hundred (adult) throats and did not find a single intact uvula. This tradition is pervasive throughout rural North Africa.

I filmed [the man removing uvulas](https://youtu.be/EztSR1a_2PA) as part of a PBS series. The footage is unusual because foreigners are not allowed inside the refugee camps before 8AM and all of these surgeries happened at around 6AM while it was still cool out. 

I have found almost nothing in the literature about this procedure. I’d be very interested in your comments.

N.B: I filmed a whole series of stories on traditional medicine in Africa – including the local bleeder, burner, butcher-surgeon, etc. I would love to post some of them here – in every case there were aspects that I could not explain – but I don’t want to overstep.

Way back when, I was a 3rd year doing a clinical in a rural Family Practice. At some point, the GP (general practitioner) and I were chatting about liver disease or something, and I mentioned that I  thought I had Gilbert's, given that at times the skin on my fingers turn yellow. He looked at my hands thoughtfully for a moment or two and asked, 

""I don't think this is Gilbert's. I've seen this once before - hyperbetacaroteninemia. How many carrots do you eat a day?""

""Well my dad has Gilbert's and I think that's probably all it is... I've had this for a long time...""

""How many carrots??""

""Um, a usually eat 1 carrot a day, rarely 2? But-""

""Yep, it must be it! Let's check for it!"" he exclaimed, as he scribbled an order for serum beta-carotene, as well as bilirbuin.

The next day I walked to my local generic commercial lab place and handed them the script. The quizzical look on the worker's face showed that she clearly had never checked someone's beta-carotene level and after some consternation and aggressive typing, she told me that the bilirubin is included in my insurance but the beta-carotene would be $850 (and remember, this is NOT the USA). I clearly deferred. 

Some time passes and the GP asks me eventually about the results. I relayed to him the above story and he paused and said, ""well, we can just check it here."" See, the preceding patient had been in the military and had some insurance where he never saw a bill, so the GP just asked his nurse to draw my blood and then ordered the lab tests under this vet's ID. 

A week later I'm back in clinic and I idly ask, ""so...did the results come back?""

""Yes. You have Gilbert's""

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yep, it must be it! Let&amp;#39;s check for it!&amp;quot; he exclaimed, as he scribbled an order for serum beta-carotene, as well as bilirbuin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day I walked to my local generic commercial lab place and handed them the script. The quizzical look on the worker&amp;#39;s face showed that she clearly had never checked someone&amp;#39;s beta-carotene level and after some consternation and aggressive typing, she told me that the bilirubin is included in my insurance but the beta-carotene would be $850 (and remember, this is NOT the USA). I clearly deferred. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time passes and the GP asks me eventually about the results. I relayed to him the above story and he paused and said, &amp;quot;well, we can just check it here.&amp;quot; See, the preceding patient had been in the military and had some insurance where he never saw a bill, so the GP just asked his nurse to draw my blood and then ordered the lab tests under this vet&amp;#39;s ID. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later I&amp;#39;m back in clinic and I idly ask, &amp;quot;so...did the results come back?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. You have Gilbert&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the whole story, still makes me chuckle 10 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

My experience with medicine so far has left me with a lot of consternation about the future, and it has made it downright painful for me to emotionally and intellectually commit to the career of a physician. I'm hoping to gather some personal perspectives here to help me come to terms with things, if possible. I've realized that I have a lot of thoughts that I don't feel free to express to academic mentors, residency programs (potential employers), etc, since it seems that the moment you betray a lack of motivation or an unwillingness to back the status quo, you are seen as a potential problem. So I will air these thoughts here and see what comes back to me. 

In trying to drill down into why so many docs are unhappy and burnt out, I've gathered a lot of opinions, examined a lot of specialties and practice environments, and read probably too many op-eds and books. What I've surmised is this: many caring and hard-working docs feel trapped bearing the emotional and professional responsibility of a system increasingly dictated by a combination of corporate profit motive and a brutally hierarchical work environment in which the least scrupulous physician leaders are rewarded by the system and rise to the top. I recognize that our society is capitalistic and everything is a ""business"" to a large extent, but the problem is that in medicine you spend all day making decisions that have life-and-death consequences for people, and it feels like at every turn the mandate we are taught to ""do what's best for the patient"" is challenged by an unending series of perverse incentives and entrenched practices. 

I know none of this is news to practicing attendings. What I have been amazed by though, is how often I have come up against situations that have caused me and some others around me a profound sense of moral distress, and the lack of any outward discussion by senior physicians. The term [""moral distress""](http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Fulltext/2015/03000/Moral_Distress_in_Nursing.17.aspx) is something I picked up when trying to put a name to the feeling I had in some situations. It's widespread in the nursing literature but interestingly very rare in articles by physicians. Basically it's when you feel compelled to take action that is counter to what you feel is the more moral/ethical choice. For me this is an extremely painful feeling and has felt like a gradual chipping at my soul. I've always lived my life striving to treat others how I would want to be treated and have my own family treated. This has proven to be absolutely impossible in modern medicine. It seems to me that there are too many factors working against your ability to apply your own personal ethical framework to any given clinical scenario, amounting to a surrender of your [""freedom of conscience""](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfm/2013/587541/). Where I have ethically felt at odds with decisions/practices that many attendings and trainees seem to take for granted have ranged from individual unique situations to guidelines set forth by professional societies. I also recently read the book *Doctored: The Disillusionment of an American Physician* by Sandeep Jauhar. He is a NYC academic cardiologist and NYT columnist who was driven to depression and cynicism because he felt he sacrificed his moral compass to make a living and fit into the cardiology community.

Some examples from my own experience to bring things into focus:

* Obvious and tired examples: short, rapid-fire PCP and psych visits, resulting in rampant overprescription of side-effect-laden statins, psych meds, etc when alternative strategies should be explored. This is often to satisfy tracked metrics or patient/administrative expectations.
* A senior attending surgeon at a major academic center with a pattern of careless behavior resulting in multiple poor outcomes. In private residents confided about feeling forced to be involved in his cases despite deep discomfort with his methods and decisions of whom to operate on. It was clear that other department leaders are aware of his conduct but his practices continue unchecked. 
* Corners cut in surgical cases to save time.
* Overly aggressive use of multiple lines of chemotherapy, without appropriate discussions of goals of care (especially bad in kids)
* Treating strep throat with antibiotics- the USA appears to be the only developed nation where this is still routine, and I'm convinced it does more harm than good for our patients and society. Yet I would probably be laughed out of most training programs and attending practices if I refused to swab and prescribe. See this interesting summary: http://rebelem.com/patients-strep-throat-need-treated-antibiotics/ 
* Defensive medicine. Examples abound, but here's the most salient: I essentially ruled out EM simply because I didn't want to subject countless patients to unnecessary radiation and hospital admission because of the fear of lawsuits. But I have learned that no specialty is safe from this.
* Many NICU and PICU cases- I have yet to hear a convincing argument as to why the compassionate choice is to continue invasive care for countless babies and disabled children who will know little but suffering in their lifetimes.
* The opioid crisis. How many docs have gotten their patients hooked on opioids because they followed the herd the last 15-20 years? What happened to those who refused to buy in to the hype?
* The ORBITA trial. The consensus seems to be that interventionalists will largely continue their stenting practices, continuing to cause many complications that could be avoided.
* So many unnecessary surgeries. It took 11 years of negative RCTs for professional orthopedic societies to recommend against knee scopes for osteoarthritis, and further examples are coming down the pipeline. Other examples include the mounting evidence against the efficacy of ear tubes and tonsillectomies, the bread and butter of ENT.
* Surgeries with potential harms out of proportion to supposed benefit (harms which are minimized in counseling or patients are not routinely informed of). I invite you to read about empty nose syndrome, the FDA LASIK controversy involving chronic dry eye/corneal pain, post-vasectomy pain syndrome, as a start. Think about whether you would subject yourself or a family member to the risk of such outcomes, and if these procedures should be performed as routinely as they are. And sure, you don't need to become the specialist that performs these too cavalierly, but you might be referring your patients to them.

Obviously many of the above points can be debated and come down to a personal weighing of risk and benefit or interpretation of the literature; that isn't the point. The problem is, what happens when my personal perception of the ethics of one of these runs counter to the prevailing dogma, or the expectations of your supervisors and administrators? The answer, it seems to me, is that you have a choice: suck it up and act against your beliefs of what is best for the patients, or be labeled a troublemaker and watch your career prospects dwindle. For those who have ever struggled with these issues, I ask: how have you coped? What I am looking for is strategies for coping with a dysfunctional and distressing environment that seems to rob ethical physicians of their personal and professional agency, from those who can empathize with the way I perceive things.

**TL;DR** I feel like a career in medicine involves a state of near-constant moral distress and an erosion over time of your ability to act upon your personal sense of right and wrong and what is best for each individual patient, if it goes against the prevailing dogma or the interests of your corporate employers and third-party payers. How do you cope with this and keep from going insane with guilt, despite the other good that you do?

I'm a nurse on med surg unit. Just hit the floor on Friday, starting my morning med pass/assessments when I get a page saying, ""From Dr. X: Foley is out for patient John Doe, 500cc emptied."" Strange, didn't realize this patient's foley was supposed to be removed. Turns out Dr. X, the attending, decided he wanted the foley out early, and rather than notifying the front desk to notify me, he went to the supply room, grabbed a syringe, and dc'd the foley himself, and knew to let us know the output emptied so we could record it.

The patient and his roommate were absolutely floored, blown away that the top doctor had no qualms with performing a task usually delegated to RNs and CNAs, they couldn't stop talking about it through the morning. I was also shocked and so impressed by Dr. X's willingness to ""humble"" himself to just pull the foley himself.

Then yesterday, same patient, Dr. X is rounding with his Jr's. Patient Doe hasn't passed gas, no bowel sounds, having lots of gas (burping), not tolerating POs, so we're concerned about post op ileus. Dr. X tells the patient that the primary goal for today is to get up and do a lot of walking to help return bowel function. This is very early in the morning so patient Doe is still in bed. Dr. X says, ""Alright let's go, we're getting you up,"" and proceeds to help get the patient up in his recliner, sets up his IV pole, positions his bedside table, and grabs him some ice chips and swabs for comfort.

When I finally get in to see the patient, he again can't stop beaming about how Dr. X helped get him up, and again I'm left in utter shock. Patient ended up walking like 3 times before noon. To his credit, Dr. X is known on the floor as one of the more down to earth attending surgeons, he's got a track record of doing these things. Still, can't help but be pleasantly surprised whenever physicians, especially the top doc's, demonstrate such humility.

No matter your area of practice/specialty, just wanted to let you all know that patients appreciate these seemingly small acts of compassion (getting the patient a cup of water, grabbing them an extra blanket and tucking them in, helping them put on their socks, tidying up their room a bit before you leave, etc etc etc). I know you guys are often overwhelmed and are often rushed during rounds, but these smalls gestures stick with patients, as well as floor staff. Especially when it's coming from the doctor.

We constantly ask ourselves &amp;quot;do I eat lunch or do I grief counsel this family?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;do I cut this patient off so that I can go to the bathroom sooner or do I allow this patient to finish his story?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Do I address the psychological factors making my patient non-compliant, alleviate their anxieties or do I plow through so that I can see all my patients in a timely manner and also so I can keep from standing up my date for the evening?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time crunch issue really scares me because I don&amp;#39;t know how I can practice humanistic medicine and see a new patient every 15 minutes or round on 40+ inpatients in a day.  I&amp;#39;m applying for positions in Pulm/Critical Care/Sleep and I&amp;#39;m concerned about having the breathing room of time to provide adequate care and not violating my core beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have any advice for a physician looking for his first job and how to not sacrifice quality of patient care and personal lifestyle?  Any questions you suggest I should ask during the interview process to get a better idea of what the work environment is like?  Am I naive to think that a physician can see patients in a timely manner, effectively, still have time for him/herself and be profitable? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I think this is both very surprising from a legal standpoint and very interesting in light of this sub's recent discussions on euthanasia.  I am just paraphrasing, but I think I read some comments here about how euthanasia is not practiced but high doses of opioids are given to terminally ill patients that inevitably have the effect of a slow fade.  How is this case charging a doctor with 25 counts of murder going to affect that?

Not a most useful, or most evidence-based, but the one that you just love for some inexplicable reason.


My favorite has to be [Beau’s lines](http://amjmed.org/optimal-systolic-blood-pressure-target-after-sprint-insights-from-a-network-meta-analysis-of-randomized-trials/) -- these are transverse ridges on the fingernails that are associated with MI, sepsis, chemotherapy -- really any major stressor to the body.  They were first described by [Joseph Honoré Simon Beau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Honor%C3%A9_Simon_Beau) in 1846 from his work on patients with cardiac disease (fun fact -- apparently Beau’s syndrome is also named after him, and I’d know more if I could read French, but Beau’s syndrome appears to be what we’d today call “asystole”). It’s related to Mee’s lines (white lines in the nails with NO indentation, classically seen in arsenic poisoning, but these days seen commonly in chemotherapy) and Muehrcke's nails (discoloration in the vascular bed of the nail, so they disappear with pressure and don’t grow with the nail; classically associated with nephrotic syndrome and severe hypoalbuminemia -- but of course, also chemotherapy).


I love Beau’s lines not because they’re incredibly clinically useful. I couldn’t find any data on them, but even in my own experience they’re not terribly sensitive, and they never tell you anything that the patient wouldn’t just tell you. The reason I love them is because nails grow at a pretty predictable rate -- about a millimeter a week. So when you ask your patient what happened four weeks ago, they think you’re some kind of wizard.


The best example that I ever saw was on a friend of mine who did wilderness trips -- two weeks in the high desert, followed by a week in civilization. They asked me what was going on with their fingernails -- and had the finest set of Beau’s lines I had ever seen. Naturally I didn’t take a picture.


Final reason I love them: Otzi the Iceman, the oldest mummy ever discovered, [also had Beau’s lines on exam](http://bedside-rounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/otzi-beaus.jpg), which has led researchers to assume he suffered repeated bouts of trauma 8, 13, and 16 weeks before death. [I even did a podcast about it](http://bedside-rounds.org/episode-17-the-iceman/).

They were first described by &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Honor%C3%A9_Simon_Beau""&gt;Joseph Honoré Simon Beau&lt;/a&gt; in 1846 from his work on patients with cardiac disease (fun fact -- apparently Beau’s syndrome is also named after him, and I’d know more if I could read French, but Beau’s syndrome appears to be what we’d today call “asystole”). It’s related to Mee’s lines (white lines in the nails with NO indentation, classically seen in arsenic poisoning, but these days seen commonly in chemotherapy) and Muehrcke&amp;#39;s nails (discoloration in the vascular bed of the nail, so they disappear with pressure and don’t grow with the nail; classically associated with nephrotic syndrome and severe hypoalbuminemia -- but of course, also chemotherapy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Beau’s lines not because they’re incredibly clinically useful. I couldn’t find any data on them, but even in my own experience they’re not terribly sensitive, and they never tell you anything that the patient wouldn’t just tell you. The reason I love them is because nails grow at a pretty predictable rate -- about a millimeter a week. So when you ask your patient what happened four weeks ago, they think you’re some kind of wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example that I ever saw was on a friend of mine who did wilderness trips -- two weeks in the high desert, followed by a week in civilization. They asked me what was going on with their fingernails -- and had the finest set of Beau’s lines I had ever seen. Naturally I didn’t take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final reason I love them: Otzi the Iceman, the oldest mummy ever discovered, &lt;a href=""http://bedside-rounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/otzi-beaus.jpg""&gt;also had Beau’s lines on exam&lt;/a&gt;, which has led researchers to assume he suffered repeated bouts of trauma 8, 13, and 16 weeks before death. &lt;a href=""http://bedside-rounds.org/episode-17-the-iceman/""&gt;I even did a podcast about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We asked you some questions about breastfeeding. My wife was concerned about getting a proper latch, how often the baby should be eating, is it supposed to hurt, and was there anything we could do about baby's fingernails, since we hadn't brought a file or clippers with us.

You were calm, reassuring, and kind. You looked to see how the baby was feeding, and you assured my wife that she was latched right. You pointed out how baby's lips were flanged out, how she had a good mouthful, and how she was taking deep and slow sucks. You reassured us that we were doing it right, and told us how to know if a latch was bad.

You came in again before your shift was over to make sure the rest of the feedings had gone well, and to let us know that you had gone ahead and called a lactation consultant to come and look things over in case we had any more questions.

What you didn't know was that we hadn't had as good fortune with baby one. She never latched right, wasn't getting enough to eat, was already underweight, and so we had to switch to formula. Through the whole ordeal, anyone we asked for help would watch her latch, say ""it looks good, and you'll know if it's a bad latch"", and then leave. It was so frustrating to not know what was wrong, and that no one would explain the situation well enough to help us. I know you guys are so very busy, but we felt so confused and over our heads.

But not you. You helped. You explained WHY it was right. You told us how to know if it was wrong. You have us to on different holds to try, how to trick baby into eating from her not-favorite breast, and you told us that pain is normal, but shouldn't be constant, and that we could expect some pain for the first couple weeks.

All of these things helped us feel WAY more informed and confident. Things weren't vague or nebulous anymore. You took the book knowledge and explained it in a practical and simple way. 

Thank you. From the bottom of our hearts (and our baby's belly), thank you. You took something that felt overwhelming and helped us find the confidence to tackle it, so far with great success. You fine folks in the medical community work ceaseless hours with hardly a word of thanks, and there's precious little I can do to change that. But thank you, each and every one of you, for the immense difference you make in the lives of others. You really are angels among humanity.

Of course there is no good research on this and the best I could find was a small study of 60 patients in china but they did not study anything to do with stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.  

So what is their thought process?  Do they have a secret set of studies that I dont have access too?  Is it just a matter of picking anything as long as it is not a traditional medication?  If they have full prescribing access to Factor Xa inhibitors what about their training says to stop that treatment and start up an earthworm pill?

Mandatory wellness sessions that are not protected mean we have to stay at work another hour or more to catch up on the things we were supposed to be doing. You make it worse.

Yoga and dogs are not going to reverse physician burnout. Being proud of yourselves for offering these things does not mean you're doing something meaningful. 

Physician burnout will be helped by addressing the main causes of burnout, which include disempowerment, too much paperwork, too much work, not enough administrative support, etc. 

PowerPoints about how we should build resilience and admonishments not to kill ourselves are demoralizing and insulting. Telling us we need to try to get sleep and exercise when you're deliberately working us 80 hours or more is just plain mean. 

Every single hospital administration led wellness program is created and enacted by people who work about 40 hours a week. Until the administrator shadows a doctor for an entire week straight, their opinion is not worth a tenth of the money spent on fancy banners and pamphlets.  

Dissuade us from the notion that physician suicides are just the cost of doing business. Every business makes a cost-benefit analysis, ie the cost of implementing a safety measure versus the cost of paying out for wrongful death often does not balance in the favor of preventing harm. Quite frankly, the cost of replacing and retraining a few dozen physicians year is a lot less than the system-wide changes required to reduce burnout.

1. US permanent residents/green card holders are now banned.

2. People visiting the US on a valid visa (work, education, going to a conference, tourism, etc.) are also now banned.

3. More relevant to the people I know, if you were in a position where you have joint Canadian citizenship and citizenship from an affected country, you are also apparently banned from the US.

Affected people have either been denied entry to flights returning to the US, or detained upon arriving in the US and denied access to legal counsel. 

In the short-term, if this affects you or anyone you know and you are currently in the US, the current recommendation is to avoid leaving the US at any point. If you are outside of the US, and planning on entering to start a fellowship/residency position/going to a conference/go on vacation/etc. you should ensure ASAP that you will not blocked from flying to the US, or detained upon arrival. In either situation, you should probably seek some combination of legal counsel or more information from relevant organizations before making any travel plans. 

I hope this doesn't negatively impact patient care, but I'll admit my most immediate concern is physicians being indefinitely detained without access to a lawyer.

In the long-term, I hope that this executive order is revised somewhat.

**Edit:**

It sounds as if a lot of this is still dynamic/in process as there is confusion about the implications and how it should be implemented:

[Lawyers at DHS are scrambling to understand the order and parse out what it means for procedures at airport checkpoints and ports of entry around the country. Most senior DHS officials were not aware of the coming changes before they were released Friday. Immigration and customs officers are struggling to figure out which incoming travelers to let in while at the same time keep up with the normal flow of travel, the senior US immigration official said.](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-unknown-number-of-u-s-permanent-1485627539-htmlstory.html).

[She and fellow lawyers worked all night fielding calls from travelers with student and worker visas who were being denied entry into the United States and ordered on flights back to the Muslim-majority countries. Enforcement of the order was spotty and disorganized. Travelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers were advising clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Yegani, who works with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.](http://globalnews.ca/news/3211433/trump-refugee-ban-causes-chaos-panic-anger-worldwide/)

**Edit:**

[Thomas Michel, a senior cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School, also reported one of his fellows couldn't travel to Boston Saturday. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Sarava was accepted to Michel's research laboratory to pursue his postdoctoral research fellowship, but his visa was suspended Friday as a result of Trump's executive order.](http://www.wcvb.com/article/several-people-prevented-from-entering-boston-due-to-trumps-executive-order/8650320)

**Edit:**

[Some institutions were already taking action before Trump signed the order. At a major teaching hospital in Ohio, one official said he had sent instructions to administrators telling them to cancel offers of residency to medical students from some countries. “We are literally going to look at ‘Country of origin’ and remove the applicant based on [that],” said the official, who did not want to be named criticizing the policy. “Can’t get more racist than that.” ](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-refugees-order-reaction-20170127-story.html)

**Edit:**

A federal court has halted deportations. However people affected by the order with valid greencards and visas who were not in transit at the time are still likely stuck abroad. In addition, if you leave the US, it sounds as if you will still be denied re-entry at this point. - http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14427086/federal-court-halts-trumps-immigration-ban","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#39;ve been following closely since it was signed as it has the potential to affect a few friends/people I trained with.

&lt;p&gt;Affected people have either been denied entry to flights returning to the US, or detained upon arriving in the US and denied access to legal counsel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, if this affects you or anyone you know and you are currently in the US, the current recommendation is to avoid leaving the US at any point. If you are outside of the US, and planning on entering to start a fellowship/residency position/going to a conference/go on vacation/etc. you should ensure ASAP that you will not blocked from flying to the US, or detained upon arrival. In either situation, you should probably seek some combination of legal counsel or more information from relevant organizations before making any travel plans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this doesn&amp;#39;t negatively impact patient care, but I&amp;#39;ll admit my most immediate concern is physicians being indefinitely detained without access to a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long-term, I hope that this executive order is revised somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some recent links with some information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds as if a lot of this is still dynamic/in process as there is confusion about the implications and how it should be implemented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-unknown-number-of-u-s-permanent-1485627539-htmlstory.html""&gt;Lawyers at DHS are scrambling to understand the order and parse out what it means for procedures at airport checkpoints and ports of entry around the country. Most senior DHS officials were not aware of the coming changes before they were released Friday. Immigration and customs officers are struggling to figure out which incoming travelers to let in while at the same time keep up with the normal flow of travel, the senior US immigration official said.&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://globalnews.ca/news/3211433/trump-refugee-ban-causes-chaos-panic-anger-worldwide/""&gt;She and fellow lawyers worked all night fielding calls from travelers with student and worker visas who were being denied entry into the United States and ordered on flights back to the Muslim-majority countries. Enforcement of the order was spotty and disorganized. Travelers were handled differently at different points of entry and immigration lawyers were advising clients to change their destination to the more lenient airports, said Yegani, who works with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.wcvb.com/article/several-people-prevented-from-entering-boston-due-to-trumps-executive-order/8650320""&gt;Thomas Michel, a senior cardiologist at Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School, also reported one of his fellows couldn&amp;#39;t travel to Boston Saturday. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Sarava was accepted to Michel&amp;#39;s research laboratory to pursue his postdoctoral research fellowship, but his visa was suspended Friday as a result of Trump&amp;#39;s executive order.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-refugees-order-reaction-20170127-story.html""&gt;Some institutions were already taking action before Trump signed the order. At a major teaching hospital in Ohio, one official said he had sent instructions to administrators telling them to cancel offers of residency to medical students from some countries. “We are literally going to look at ‘Country of origin’ and remove the applicant based on [that],” said the official, who did not want to be named criticizing the policy. “Can’t get more racist than that.” &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal court has halted deportations. However people affected by the order with valid greencards and visas who were not in transit at the time are still likely stuck abroad. In addition, if you leave the US, it sounds as if you will still be denied re-entry at this point. - &lt;a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14427086/federal-court-halts-trumps-immigration-ban""&gt;http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14427086/federal-court-halts-trumps-immigration-ban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to add something about my experience to the discussion. 

I am a 43 yo general internist and have been in practice for 15 years in a large multispecialty group practice. I work and live in a metropolitan area with a population of half a million, with another million in the surrounding metro area.  

For the first 10 years of my career I worked on call to the ER a few nights a month and rounded in the hospital a week every 6-8 weeks in addition to running a clinic practice.  I gave this call schedule up voluntarily 5 years ago when I got married and we started to plan kids, as I found sleeping in my bed every night to be increasingly compelling.  Now my work is all clinic based.

My salary, plus bonuses, at this point is 240k, and I do not pay my own malpractice out of this (just taxes, which is enough).  I take every Wed afternoon off (and take a 10% pay cut to do so, this is reflected in my salary above already), but to be honest I spend half of that time catching up on work.  My typical work day is between 10-11 hours, and I do not take lunch.  I also work a few hours every weekend from home to keep caught up. 

Because I work in a large group practice, I do NO insurance paperwork.  Yes, you did read that correctly.  That does not mean I do not have all kinds of BS to put up with, just not that particularly irritating kind.  The BS I do put up with includes all sort of Dilbert-esque level large corporate nonsense, but none that has interfered with what I do inside the exam room. 

My visits with patients are typically 20 minutes.  I carry a panel of about 1900 patients, who vary from homeless people with drug habits to a serving congressman.  Over 85% of the patients I see daily are on my own panel, and many of them I have known for over 10 years.  
As this is a diverse area, I see people with a very wide variety of ethnic backgrounds (including recent Hmong, Russian, Nigerian, and Brittish expats) and use language line phone translation not infrequently during exams. 

In addition to visits, I spend about 2-3 hours a day managing lab results, replying to patient emails, establishing followup plans from hospitalizations, etc.  I also serve on our quality assurance committee (I highly suggest getting involved in this if you can; it is an education in and of itself). 

Since I work in a large group practice where there are no barriers to communication with specialists, I find that the medicine part of my job can be as complex as I want it to be.  I send patients out to see specialists when either I need their expertise or to do a procedure I do not perform.   Often times I collaborate with them via the phone or email,  often times in real time while the patient is in the exam room (video derm consults included here).   

I manage my own heart failure, CAD, asthma, COPD, etc.  I treat a lot of common ailments, but also spend a lot of time working up new complaints. Because my nurses are great, we can handle some things that might go to the ED otherwise (put fluid into the potentially septic patient while waiting on their lactic acid level, for example, or get same day cat scans done with stat labs on a RLQ abdominal pain). 

When word got out my wife was expecting, I received from my patients something like a dozen home made receiving blankets, including ones that (from watching my wife do similar projects) I know must have taken twenty or thirty hours of work to create.  Jokes, inquiries about my family's well being, and other small gifts are common occurrences (and things I greatly appreciate).  The vast majority of my patient interactions are pleasant or downright fun. 

Because I get up early every morning (well, I'm at work at 7:30, so that will not sound early to you poor slobs still in training, sorry!), I am home in time every night to eat dinner with my family, do bath time and story time with my daughter, and spend time with my wife before going to sleep.  If you do not have a family now, believe me, this will be VERY important to you later. 

My undergraduate degree was from an ivy-league school in molecular biology, and I finished in the top 1/3 of my graduating class in medical school.  I initially thought about going into gastroenterology (endoscopy is cool) but lost interest along the way, and did not like the idea of being a trainee for another two or three years after residency.  I have found in no way that my interactions with specialists have left me feeling like a second class citizen; many of them are not just my colleagues, but my patients as well!

Personally, I like my doctoring to be a 50/50 mix of biomedicine and personal interaction, which is why I think primary care works well for me as a career.  Of course I do see tons of colds, and also have repeated the information about colorectal cancer screening so many times it is a loop tape in my head now that I probably mutter in my sleep.  But last week in clinic I also had a new spontaneous pneumothorax (my diagnosis, pulmonary clinic put in the catheter), a new dx of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain in a 42 yo (missed by the ER two days previously, due to her near complete lack of focal neurological findings despite her significant midline shift, a real tragedy for her family), and a follow up appointment with my gent with a thoracic stromal cell tumor (good news, surgeon felt likely to be nonaggressive, we await final immunohistology to find out).  And also saw the patient who has lost 80 lbs in two years without gastric bypass because she listened to me that she needed to get more exercise and stop eating so damn much.  :)

I have no idea how typical or not my personal experience is among primary care doctors nationwide.  Personally I am quite happy to be practicing as a general internist and have no regrets about my decision to not pursue a subspecialty.  

To the medical students and residents reading this forum - I wish you all the best of luck making this choice.  Finding out you picked the wrong specialty after the fact is a hard pill to swallow, but there are certainly worse mistakes you can make in life.  Go investigate your options on your own as vigorously as you can (including getting outside of the academic world) and do not take anyone's word over your own judgement on something this important.

&lt;p&gt;My visits with patients are typically 20 minutes.  I carry a panel of about 1900 patients, who vary from homeless people with drug habits to a serving congressman.  Over 85% of the patients I see daily are on my own panel, and many of them I have known for over 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;
As this is a diverse area, I see people with a very wide variety of ethnic backgrounds (including recent Hmong, Russian, Nigerian, and Brittish expats) and use language line phone translation not infrequently during exams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to visits, I spend about 2-3 hours a day managing lab results, replying to patient emails, establishing followup plans from hospitalizations, etc.  I also serve on our quality assurance committee (I highly suggest getting involved in this if you can; it is an education in and of itself). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I work in a large group practice where there are no barriers to communication with specialists, I find that the medicine part of my job can be as complex as I want it to be.  I send patients out to see specialists when either I need their expertise or to do a procedure I do not perform.   Often times I collaborate with them via the phone or email,  often times in real time while the patient is in the exam room (video derm consults included here).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I manage my own heart failure, CAD, asthma, COPD, etc.  I treat a lot of common ailments, but also spend a lot of time working up new complaints. Because my nurses are great, we can handle some things that might go to the ED otherwise (put fluid into the potentially septic patient while waiting on their lactic acid level, for example, or get same day cat scans done with stat labs on a RLQ abdominal pain). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When word got out my wife was expecting, I received from my patients something like a dozen home made receiving blankets, including ones that (from watching my wife do similar projects) I know must have taken twenty or thirty hours of work to create.  Jokes, inquiries about my family&amp;#39;s well being, and other small gifts are common occurrences (and things I greatly appreciate).  The vast majority of my patient interactions are pleasant or downright fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I get up early every morning (well, I&amp;#39;m at work at 7:30, so that will not sound early to you poor slobs still in training, sorry!), I am home in time every night to eat dinner with my family, do bath time and story time with my daughter, and spend time with my wife before going to sleep.  If you do not have a family now, believe me, this will be VERY important to you later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My undergraduate degree was from an ivy-league school in molecular biology, and I finished in the top 1/3 of my graduating class in medical school.  I initially thought about going into gastroenterology (endoscopy is cool) but lost interest along the way, and did not like the idea of being a trainee for another two or three years after residency.  I have found in no way that my interactions with specialists have left me feeling like a second class citizen; many of them are not just my colleagues, but my patients as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like my doctoring to be a 50/50 mix of biomedicine and personal interaction, which is why I think primary care works well for me as a career.  Of course I do see tons of colds, and also have repeated the information about colorectal cancer screening so many times it is a loop tape in my head now that I probably mutter in my sleep.  But last week in clinic I also had a new spontaneous pneumothorax (my diagnosis, pulmonary clinic put in the catheter), a new dx of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain in a 42 yo (missed by the ER two days previously, due to her near complete lack of focal neurological findings despite her significant midline shift, a real tragedy for her family), and a follow up appointment with my gent with a thoracic stromal cell tumor (good news, surgeon felt likely to be nonaggressive, we await final immunohistology to find out).  And also saw the patient who has lost 80 lbs in two years without gastric bypass because she listened to me that she needed to get more exercise and stop eating so damn much.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how typical or not my personal experience is among primary care doctors nationwide.  Personally I am quite happy to be practicing as a general internist and have no regrets about my decision to not pursue a subspecialty.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the medical students and residents reading this forum - I wish you all the best of luck making this choice.  Finding out you picked the wrong specialty after the fact is a hard pill to swallow, but there are certainly worse mistakes you can make in life.  Go investigate your options on your own as vigorously as you can (including getting outside of the academic world) and do not take anyone&amp;#39;s word over your own judgement on something this important. &lt;/p&gt;

Finished my intern year 2 months ago.

I had the evening/night shift (3.30 pm to 9 am) sunday-monday. I had 83 patient in my care between 4 different wards. Only doctor in my department at work.

It was a busy night. I was dealing with an obstructive ileus in a patient initially commited with a uti and a few with respiratory problems that were fairly easily managed.

I was called to the patient in question around 11.30 pm (don't really want to go into the specific case details - went over those with two different senior doctors). I examined him, asked for a consult from the appropriate specialty, made a plan and thought nothing more of it. He seemed well enough when speaking to him and his vitals was nothing out of the ordinary for him. 

The nurses called me at 6 am telling me he was found dead in his bed. I had to show up and declare him dead.

I did not see this coming at all. I was totally shocked. I have had people die in my care before, but those times we had either stopped active care or it was not-so-surprising.

He was 77. He had several comorbidities. Still, I was in shock. I wasn't able to keep it together. I called my attending on call, my mother and a friend I knew was on shift at a different hospital, who luckily was having a quiet morning. I made it through the morning conference without crying, even while presenting this patient. But I couldn't hold back the tears afterwards. Talked to another senior colleague for 30 minutes after. Everyone was really nice.

I went to eat and have two beers with some intern colleagues yesterday. Talked it out again. Managed to have a nice evening. But I couldn't get myself to work today. I feel awful. I keep questioning myself - if I could have prevented it somehow - even though my seniors have assured me I did a good job. This was my first truly unexpected death, but surely it wont be my last. I knew it would happen some day, as all of us do.

I am going to go to work tomorrow. And I have an appointment with my psychologist on thursday, but any advice would be appreciated.

EDIT: I want to sincerely thank every single one of you - also the few of you I didn't get around to answer directly. I read and appreciated all of your comments. This has been way more therapeutic than expected. This is such a great community. And it's funny to see how relatable this job is across borders and cultures.

We wanted to invite you to join the recent r/medicalschool post series that's been user-initiated and is getting a really great reception. Essentially, residents and attendings have been creating posts titled ""why you should go into X specialty- a residents perspective"" and then interacting with med students and answering questions in the comments. **If you're interested in sharing the ins and outs of your experience, please consider joining us!**

**Create a new post in the r/medicalschool sub** so that students can interact with you in the comments, and be sure to tag it with the \[residency\] tag. We have a recommended format (see the end of this post) that you can use to structure your thoughts. **All posts will be saved as links in our wiki for posterity** so that future students can learn from you as well!

We have a request thread that can [**be found here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sk6wr/request_for_residents_who_are_about_to_finish/),  please check out what people have been interested in learning more about! Even if someone has already done a post, feel free to create your own if you feel that you have additional thoughts- the more the merrier! Here are a few examples of posts by other residents:

[Diagnostic Radiology](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8scqtt/residencywhy_you_should_do_diagnostic_radiology/)

[Neurology](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8so23r/why_you_should_do_neurology_a_residents/)

[PM&amp;amp;R](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8sn90g/residency_why_you_should_do_pmr_a_residents/)

**Recommended Format** (feel free to pick and choose/add whatever you like!)

**Background**: a little bit about yourself

**Residency years**: description of PGY-1, -2, etc.

**Fellowships:** available fellowships

**Typical day**: your hourly schedule (e.g. 8:00-12:00 clinic seeing X amount of Y patients)

**Call**: description of call schedule/frequency, types of consults etc.

**Inpatient vs Outpatient**: what are the settings you practice in?

**Procedures:** what do you do with your hands?

**Lifestyle**: how's the work/life balance?

**Income**: are you appropriately compensated?

**Reasons why to do X specialty**: what's attractive about your field? what's your favorite part? What's a little-known perk?

**How do you know if X specialty is right for you?**: what sort of personality types really excel? Conversely, what type of people aren't a great fit?

**Dismissing some misconceptions**: bust some myths pertinent to your field

**Downsides**: what are the cons of your field? long hours? paperwork? What's your least favorite part of the day?

Thanks in advance for participating, and have a great weekend!

Something I've been thinking of after watching the news recently. It seems that pseudoscientific professions like ~~chiromancers~~ chiropractors and naturopaths are getting more and more rights and impact in government, usually through lobbying politicians that don't know any better.

However, aside from some meek attempts from some colleges/associations, there's not a lot of push-back against this sort of BS.

&lt;p&gt;Any insight would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I was talking with some fellow students about this today. Obviously, not being obese and being a nonsmoker is *healthier*, but they seemed to virtually take it for granted that a doctor who looks fit/doesn't smoke etc. is *better for patients* when dealing with problems like obesity or smoking cessation, because they ""lead by example"" -- sort of an extension of the classic parenting problem, ""do what I say, not what I do"". Skin in the game, I suppose.


They spoke of their own experiences in whose advice they tended to take seriously, and generally agreed that they listened more to people who practiced what they preached. Which is fair enough, I guess you'd want e.g. your personal trainer to look like they work out a lot, but do patients really look to their doctors as inspirational models in the same way? I couldn't help but notice that this was coming from a bunch of very fit mid-20s people. Obesity carries a great deal of stigma, overweight people are often very ashamed of their bodies. It seems to me that perhaps it also makes it more difficult for a sixty year old cab driver to take advice if their physician looks like they run marathons for fun -- because of the stigma, or a perceived lack of ability to sympathise with how hard losing weight is, or because they simply feel less kinship/shared hardship. I imagine having some ubermensch list all the ways in which you need to improve to be healthy might actually be pretty demoralising and demotivating.


I'm not suggesting doctors should be unhealthy for the sake of their patients (or healthy), or that patients should only be treated by physicians that look like them, or anything ridiculous like that. I'm just curious whether the physician's appearance has an impact on patient compliance/motivation/emotional well-being, what it's like for the patient to meet a doctor who has some personal experience with their troubles vs. someone who seems to have their shit together perfectly.

&gt;55.000 doctors working in over 500 publically owned hospitals, &gt;represented by their union ""Marburger Bund"", refused an offer &gt;made by the employers negotiators in the ongoing negotiations &gt;about working contracts and conditions (""Tarifverhandlungen"").

&gt;Employers offered a 5,4 % raise in 2 steps over 2.5 years.
&gt;Marburger Bund demanded a 5% raise and new negotiations new &gt;conditions after 1 year, additionally they demanded exact &gt;registration of working time and a time limit on call-, overnight &gt;-and weekend-hours.

&gt;The Marburger Bund called the offer proposed by the employers &gt;""not acceptable"", and ""an attempt to take our self-estem"".

&gt;To force issues, doctors will begin voting whether to go on strike &gt;soon. An emergency service will always be availiable.

&gt;Strikes, while common in other sectors, are rare for doctors.
&gt;It would be the second doctors strike, the first being in 2006.

Almost all doctors up to young attendings in Germany are employed through union-negotiated contracts. 
The doctors union boasts 118.00 members and is Europe´s biggest, recruiting members already in University through cheap or free insurance for its members, workshops and help in law or empoyment issues.

I'm quite thankful for representation and someone who is willing to deal with empoyers, as i dont feel confident negotiating pay andworking condition as a mere resident. 
Also transparency regarding pay of my peers feels nice and hopefully prevents any discrimination.

You can view the current pay grades [in this table](
https://www.marburger-bund.de/sites/default/files/tarifvertraege/2018-08/entgelttabelle-zum-tv-aerztevka.pdf)

The groups represent
I : resident physicians

II: physicians who finished residency and are ""Fachärzte"", specialty doctors

III: ""Oberärzte"", attending physicians

IV: ""leitende Oberärzte"", chief attendings, second to the chief.


The ""Entwicklungsstufen"" are raises after a certain amount of time you practiced in the pay group (I-IV)



How are employment conflics handled in your country?

Is there a big difference in pay?


**EDIT:**
As many comments pointed out, the tables provided only show base compensation (42h work week, paid vacation) **before** taxes, but without the compensation for taking call, which can boost your monthly income significantly 

Also, the tables are only for hospital-employed doctors. independent physicians are earning a lot more, depending on specialty, location and patient census.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;
As many comments pointed out, the tables provided only show base compensation (42h work week, paid vacation) &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; taxes, but without the compensation for taking call, which can boost your monthly income significantly &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the tables are only for hospital-employed doctors. independent physicians are earning a lot more, depending on specialty, location and patient census. 
For example, Ophto makes mad bank with cataract surgery and intravitreal injections. I dont have any numbers for that though&lt;/p&gt;

My main concern wasn't about the ratio - it was mostly around the rule going live in 3 months and that non-abiding hospitals are charged $25k/day as a penalty  (not sure where that $ is going, I'm guessing to the state fund?). I  want to leave that issue aside though, since it's not why I'm posting.

I  didn't realize how many providers truly HATED non-clinicians. They say  when you've worked in one hospital, you've worked in one hospital.  That's true for me (I've only been at one institution), but I feel like  my organization does generally a good job in supporting clinical staff  based on my conversations with them, and I guess I don't know what it's  like in other hospitals where your management team really just is about  nothing but money.

Anyway, after being  told that I'm a parasite, a leech, etc. it seems clear to me that  administrators as a whole have to do better.

I  don't know where these admins come from that make you treat patients  differently based on ability to pay (we blind our docs to that  information) and I'm truly sorry any time that you've had someone tell  you how to do your job, disrespected you, or took the joy out of caring  for patients. I've only been in this industry for one year, and I find reading through comments about burnout, ratios, even just random  clinical issues to be really interesting and reflects a great community.

I'm  assuming this might be downvoted to oblivion, since I'm just an admin.  But the conversation has to start somewhere, and I hope that I can take  lessons from here on what NOT to be and we can work together to help  patients. Thank you.

EDIT: I appreciate all of the feedback. I know many of you have been in the trenches for years (dozens of years?), and I'm a desk jockey with literally a year of work experience under my belt in healthcare finance. I plan on going through the comments a bit more in detail, reaching out to some of our doctors and nurses I know to shadow them in the early mornings, and advocating more strongly when I hear anything about requiring further metric measurement (not that I have any real power, but better than just sitting there silently)...I hope that my curiosity in these issues comes across as genuine.

I do think good administrators add value (though no doubt there is bloat, and it is probably worse in some depts than others). There are regulatory requirements, payer nonsense, HR, IT, etc. that all organizations need, one way or another. But it seems many of us have strayed further than others from the core mission of taking care of our people, so they can take care of patients. 

Above all, thank you for healing patients amidst all the hurdles you face.

The patient in question was a middle-aged man with ESRD on HD (MWF) who had missed a week of dialysis.  He was enroute to an urgent session on Saturday when he became pulseless in the back of the BLS transport.

He arrived in PEA arrest with compressions in progress but nothing else.  As soon as a PIV was established in his AV fistula, the R3 running the resuscitation asked for the RN to administer epinephrine and calcium chloride.  

At this point, the RN asks ""are you sure about the calcium?""  When the R3 confirmed the order, the RN said ""that's not in the ACLS guidelines and we don't know what the patient's electrolytes are.""  The RN pushed epinephrine but wouldn't push the calcium.

Ultimately, the resident administered the calcium themselves and an iStat chem8 came back with a K of 8.8 (shocker).  Ultimately, the code went on for 25 minutes before the patient achieved ROSC and was transferred to the neuro ICU for post-resus care and emergent dialysis.

Afterwards, the R3 tried to educate the RN in question about the importance of treating the cause of arrest, but this RN was adamant that they weren't going to push the calcium without a lab value for potassium.  They said that doing so would expose them to legal liability and could result in the loss of their license for not following established guidelines.  They even suggested that the R3 was opening themselves to liability by acting ""like a cowboy.""

To me, the case seems pretty clear.  Even the AHA guidelines state that you need to identify and treat the causes of PEA arrest in addition to providing quality CPR and using the indicated ACLS drugs.  The obvious reason for this patient's arrest was hyperkalemia; the clinical suspicion for which was so strong that it would be reasonable to make the diagnosis on history and ECG alone.

What this really illustrates to me is the difference in thinking between physicians and nurses/support staff.  When a doctor makes a clinical decision, they can back it up by stating it is their ""medical opinion.""  When a nurse wants to make a clinical decision, they defer to guidelines and back it up with the threat of legal liability.

I'm curious what meddit has to say about the above and perhaps how they would have handled the situation.

I know it sounds too good/bad to be anything but a troll, but rest assured I'm not making this up. My GF is a CNA (nurse's assistant) and about to start on her BSN. At her hospital, there's a NP that's apparently quite rude to the RNs, CNAs, and everyone else she deems beneath her. That alone is shitty and unprofessional coming from a physician, and even worse coming from a practitioner than didn't go to medical school and used to a nurse.

The icing on the cake is that she walks into patients' rooms wearing a white coat and introduces herself as a medical doctor. My GF's actual example was ""Hi, I'm Dr. X, I'm the medical doctor this morning doing rounds."" This particular state's only laws regarding how an ""advanced practice nurse"" may introduce themselves is that they may refer to themselves as ""certified nurse midwife"", ""clinical nurse specialist"", ""certified registered nurse anesthetist"", or ""nurse practitioner"". Given the lack of legislation around calling herself ""Dr. X"", that is likely technically legal since she has a DNP degree (doctoral level), even if it's pretty unsavory. Actually referring to oneself as a medical doctor without an MD/DO degree is a different story. Presumably, this would be classified as criminal impersonation (though I'm obviously not a lawyer), because I don't believe the state has specific statutes concerning the impersonation of a physician.

Anyone care to comment, particularly on what she ought to do? My only thought is to report her to the hospital and/or licensing board (apparently the nurses there can't stand her). One issue there is a lack of proof; the only time she says this nonsense is in patients' rooms, and recording under such circumstances is likely to be out of the question due to patient privacy concerns. Is she just SOL and has to deal with a rude superior that introduces herself as a physician to patients? I'd love to hear y'all's take.

And not only how wrong we are, but how confident we are in our wrong-ness. Our hubris knows no bounds. 

My examples:

1. Tobacco smoke enemas of the 1700's. This is so ridiculous that it's almost hard to believe. Medical professionals of the time thought that blowing tobacco smoke into the rectum could resuscitate drowning victims.  They actually lined The River Thames in England with tobacco enema kits in the same way we line society with AEDs today. 

2. A more modern example - blood sugar control in the ICU. I vividly remember rotating through the surgical ICU as a medical student. It was terrifying. Malignant attendings and overworked, miserable residents gave me a sad glimpse into my immediate future. One memory that is burned into my brain is the daily tongue lashing the residents received because of the 'poor glucose control' of their patients. 

""Glucose needs to be below 110!!!""
""Increased mortality!!!""
""This is evidence based!!!""
(Van den Berghe Neurology 2005;64(8):1348)

Fast forward two years later. I, a young resident in the SICU, am fully prepared to be aggressive with my insulin. Only to find out....""oh yeah, we don't do that any more"".

""You mean... all that yelling during rounds two years ago was for nothing?""
""....pretty much""
(NICE SUGAR NEJM 360: 1283, 2009)

I often wonder what practices I currently have that will look absolutely incompetent 5, 10, or 100 years from now.

In the meantime.... Does anyone have any good examples of modern medicine getting in completely wrong? How have you seen medicine evolve throughout your careers?

PS
Miasma theory is also amazing.

[SMART Trial- Balanced Fluids versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711584?query=featured_home)

[SALT-ED Trial- Balanced Fluids versus Saline in Noncritically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711586?query=featured_home)

These are sister studies performed at Vanderbilt over a 16 month period. Patients were randomized based on the month they arrived to the ER. The SMART trial had a primary outcome of a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥200% of baseline). This composite outcome will undoubtedly be a point of contention from detractors, and I have to agree that I really do not like composite outcomes, especially when each individual component of the composite fails to meet statistical significance. Interestingly, however, the statistical significance of the SMART trials composite outcome seemed to primarily be driven by mortality. 

The SALT-ED trial strangely chose hospital free days as their primary outcome with major adverse kidney events being a secondary outcome. The trial failed at demonstrating a difference in primary outcome, but there was a significant difference in major adverse kidney events. 

Although I despise composite outcomes, I have to say that, for me, this is the final straw in the debate of saline vs balanced fluids. While some might argue that an NNT of something like 96, may not be clinically significant, the amount of fluids that are given in our ERs on a daily basis is enough for that NNT to be significant IMO.

Rales, Rhonchi, Crepitations, Crackles, Wheeze, Fine and Coarse, Sonourous Rhonchi etc- many of which are understood very differently between clinicians.

To put this to rest - René Laennec, the inventor of the first crude stethoscope at the Necker Hospital for Sick Kids in the early 1800's, first began to describe his auscultatory findings of this new device in his patient population. TB was rampant at the time in Paris, and as word of Dr. Laennec's stethoscope spread, patients began to fear his bedside findings of the ""Râle"" (the French term for rattle - known colloquially as the ""death rattle of TB"" amongst terrified patients). After realising the fear he would instill into those with new diagnoses of TB using the word 'rattle' to describe his findings (coarse crackles by today's standards) Laennec simply switched to using the Latin word for rattle - Rhoncus/Rhonci - to build that intellectually verbal barrier between patients, something still done very much so to this day. 

In 1821 Laennec's​ work on the steth (including individual lung sounds) was translated into English by John Forbes. Forbes incorrectly translated some aspects of his work - particularly identifying râle and rhoncus as separate terms, one identifying a coarse crackles and the other meaning a type of wheeze. 

Fast forward to the 1980's and the International Lung Sounds association attempted to consolidate the aforementioned confusing terms. Essentially, there are only 2 types of sounds heard on the vast majority of lung exams - crackles and wheezes. Crackles are discontinuous, wheezes are continuous. Sounds can be inspiratory, expiratory or both. Crackles can be fine or coarse - nothing else.

Lung sounds should be recorded in 3 steps in notes.


1. Air entry: Good air entry or Poor air entry


2. Breath Sounds: Vesicular, Bronchovesicular or Bronchial


3. Adventitious sounds: Crackle (Coarse or Fine); Wheeze; Stridor and their relation to INSP/EXP

Crepitations are the British English term for crackles. Rales and Rhonci do not exist anymore as appropriate clinical terms (although not quite true for Rhonci - which is still used in some experimental settings for auscultatory recordings - but for the most part forget they exist).

Are there any interesting examples of similar nuanced aspects of medicine in your clinical practice?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example: In lung auscultation I feel that there is a significant misunderstanding of many of the terms used to describe various breath sounds heard during bedside auscultation. Rales, Rhonchi, Crepitations, Crackles, Wheeze, Fine and Coarse, Sonourous Rhonchi etc- many of which are understood very differently between clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this to rest - René Laennec, the inventor of the first crude stethoscope at the Necker Hospital for Sick Kids in the early 1800&amp;#39;s, first began to describe his auscultatory findings of this new device in his patient population. TB was rampant at the time in Paris, and as word of Dr. Laennec&amp;#39;s stethoscope spread, patients began to fear his bedside findings of the &amp;quot;Râle&amp;quot; (the French term for rattle - known colloquially as the &amp;quot;death rattle of TB&amp;quot; amongst terrified patients). After realising the fear he would instill into those with new diagnoses of TB using the word &amp;#39;rattle&amp;#39; to describe his findings (coarse crackles by today&amp;#39;s standards) Laennec simply switched to using the Latin word for rattle - Rhoncus/Rhonci - to build that intellectually verbal barrier between patients, something still done very much so to this day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1821 Laennec&amp;#39;s​ work on the steth (including individual lung sounds) was translated into English by John Forbes. Forbes incorrectly translated some aspects of his work - particularly identifying râle and rhoncus as separate terms, one identifying a coarse crackles and the other meaning a type of wheeze. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to the 1980&amp;#39;s and the International Lung Sounds association attempted to consolidate the aforementioned confusing terms. Essentially, there are only 2 types of sounds heard on the vast majority of lung exams - crackles and wheezes. Crackles are discontinuous, wheezes are continuous. Sounds can be inspiratory, expiratory or both. Crackles can be fine or coarse - nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lung sounds should be recorded in 3 steps in notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air entry: Good air entry or Poor air entry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breath Sounds: Vesicular, Bronchovesicular or Bronchial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adventitious sounds: Crackle (Coarse or Fine); Wheeze; Stridor and their relation to INSP/EXP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crepitations are the British English term for crackles. Rales and Rhonci do not exist anymore as appropriate clinical terms (although not quite true for Rhonci - which is still used in some experimental settings for auscultatory recordings - but for the most part forget they exist).&lt;/p&gt;

\- they are super comfortable

\- its a hassle to make sure clothes are clean, ironed and ready, every morning, especially with a 7 am - 7 pm schedule, not to mention the pain to mix and match styles and colors

\- they are super professional for the type of work I do , FFS, I am not wearing a bikini thong while seeing a patient

\- they are issued by the hospital, if it was so wrong, the hospital would just stop issuing scrubs to me

\- I dont see a point walking into an infection with my $100-200 worth of professional clothes

\- almost ALL other countries, anyone who works in a hospital, is MANDATED to wear scrubs (aka hospital supplied clothes), I dont understand the American obsession of dressing up like a car salesman

\- my job is 100% clinical ( well 20% clinical and 80% computer typing), I dont have ANY managerial or administrative duties and its 100 % inpatient. I am dressing for the job

\- I tried to look up my hospital official policies, but so far, no luck. I guess we are just expected to dress up professionally.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know how to deal with the situation. I have expressed my desire to wear scrubs multiple times, but she just doesnt get it. In the back of my mind, I want to say that unless you tell me I will be fired or disciplined for wearing scrubs, I will continue to wear them, But honestly I would never want it to escalate it to this level.

Should i talk to the director ?

Should I just give up and start dressing up like a car salesman ?

Is there a middle ground ?

[SB 538 text](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB538)

The bill recently passed the Senate Committee on Business, Professions, and Economic Development with a vote of 7-2.

The bill was scheduled to be heard by the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 11, but was postponed until May 18. This is a good chance to kill this bill.

Please contact the following Senators who sit on the Appropriations Committee:

* [Senator Ricardo Lara (Chair)](http://senate.ca.gov/sd33)
* [Senator Patricia Bates (Vice Chair)](http://senate.ca.gov/sd36)
* [Senator Jim Beall](http://senate.ca.gov/sd15)
* [Senator Jerry Hill](http://senate.ca.gov/sd13)
* [Senator Connie Leyva](http://senate.ca.gov/sd20)
* [Senator Tony Mendoza](http://senate.ca.gov/sd32)
* [Senator Jim Nielsen](http://senate.ca.gov/sd04)

SB538 is sponsored by [Senator Marty Block](http://sd39.senate.ca.gov/), so you should also urge him to withdraw his support.

SB538 is also supported by the [California AARP](http://states.aarp.org/contact-aarp-california/), so you may want to let them know that naturopathic medicine can seriously harm senior citizens.

Please take action! 

Failure of this bill would be a huge success for the medical community, as naturopaths use legislative successes in big states to promote their pseudoscience in other states and at the federal level.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

****UPDATE: SB538 appearance in the Senate Appropriations Committee was cancelled by its author! I am not sure if this means he is withdrawing the bill, but it seems like a good sign that this bill is on the out.

So I have a colleague in the ICU (fellow intensivist) who is new out of fellowship and is quite young for his profession (early college or something). He is, by all accounts, following all guidelines. He also moved to a conservative town in Alabama for his wife’s work and is a tatted up native Hawaiian. 


One middle aged nurse in particular is a cause of issues around the unit, and she has been called on about her issues at least once in the past. She was on vacation when my colleague started and when she came back immediately filed a report about my colleague because he called her bro and she found it unprofessional (he says these things in nearly every sentence when addressing people). Since then, she has seemingly taken interest in tarnishing his reputation. 



What happened next is quite a misfortune.  He had a patient who was intermediate risk for CAD with a trop leak. He was going off service the next day. He 2-PC’d the patient for a stress test (they were intubated) and the nurse in question happened to be taking care of the patient. She ran to the ICU director and told him that they thought my colleague was high and forgot intubated patients can’t get stress tests (when I questioned him he told me it was ordered because he was going off service and the patient would need it when they were inevatably extubated). I have been told by other nursing staff in private that this nurse chose to also encourage her friends to go to administration and at least one did with a phony story stating that my colleague was erratic on a consistent basis and made patients uncomfortable. It’s sad; most of the people liked my colleague. 


Administration called him in and told him that there were complaints about his erratic behavior from numerous nurses. As he just started, this was obviously jarring to all, and they threatened to restrict his privelages and submit him for random drug testing (he, by all accounts, has had no negative disciplinary issues ever). He was floored by this, alongside some racist comments, and walked out of the practice on the spot. He wasn’t too happy to begin with at the practice, and it admittedly is crumbling so this was the straw that broke the camels back. He’s currently working per diem coverage and his wife (thankfully) realized that they likely will be relocating. Happy ending, yay. 



My question is this-this nurse clearly had some issues, Be they racially motivated or just on a personal beef (with him being young she actually told him to page his resident and he informed her he was the attending, for example). I think someone who is viciously trying to impact the livelihood of others in the profession should answer for her actions.



I have considered talking to the ICU/nursing director, but other colleagues suggested calling the nursing board or even complaining to the hospital system (part of a large one). I’m erring on a larger scale, as her baseless accusations could have easily ruined a career.

I suppose what I’m getting at is this: MD/DO is a title that’s (to one degree or another) equated with a lot of things: being smart, being accomplished, being useful to society, being a good person, etc. That may be diminishingly true as time goes on, but I think it’s still the general perception as of right now.

Like you, I didn’t go into all of this for the sake of my own ego. But I can’t say that ego had *nothing* to do with it either. I didn’t just love the idea of medicine, after all. I’ve loved the idea of being a doctor – of being the one who figured out the diagnosis, or who did the thing that mattered – since I was 8 years old. It's not just job satisfaction, I'm almost sure.

I think we all dance around the idea of ego a little in medicine. Certainly the few times I’ve tried to bring it up with colleagues, there’s been a lot of hesitation and non-answering. And I get it; we’re supposed to be altruists, and nobody wants to rock that particular boat. 

Still, I’m awfully curious. Maybe this is just navel-gazing, and maybe it isn’t. How much of a role did ego play in your career choices?

Dear Members of the Graduate Medical Education Community,
 
Since the Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” was issued on Friday, January 27, the ACGME leadership has been working with the leadership of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and other organizations to understand the details of the policies announced, and the implications for our current and future residents and fellows.

There are over 10,000 licensed physicians in the US who graduated from medical schools in one of the seven countries named in the Executive Order (EO). Some of these physicians practice in underserved communities through the Conrad 30 Waiver Program that permits International Medical Graduates (IMGs) to remain in the United States after graduation in order to provide care to medically underserved communities. They are a valued and welcomed group of colleagues.

There are currently approximately 1800 physicians enrolled in ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs who graduated from medical schools in the seven named countries. These physicians are providing much-needed medical care to a conservatively estimated 900,000 patients in urban, suburban, and rural communities across the country annually. They too are a valued and welcomed group of colleagues.

The ACGME, through its requirements and eligibility standards, articulates the values of our profession. Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or other factors is a violation of our personal and professional values. To this end, we have worked with the AAMC and others to co-author a letter to President Trump representing the values of the profession, and concerns over these actions.

The ACGME is committed to programs in support of their residents, fellows, designated institutional officials, program directors, and the entire GME community through the disruption and uncertainty created by the EO. Our function on behalf of the medical community is to create an optimal clinical learning environment for residents and fellows in order to ensure that patients receive the highest quality of care. We will provide, as soon as we have it, authoritative information to you, through our combined efforts with the AAMC, ECFMG, and others, through our website and links to other authoritative sources.

Most importantly, we will continue to point out to the public and the profession the profound moral distress this EO has provoked within the health care community. We all know or know of individuals who have been directly affected by this event. What is not often as obvious is the anxiety and frustration it provokes in others indirectly impacted by the event. We might have concern for a colleague or friend, concern for family members, concern for contagion, or merely anger and frustration over the affront to personal and professional values. We encourage programs to spend time discussing these events, respecting all viewpoints, and deciding on actions where indicated to reaffirm our values, and support those in distress. This is a “teachable moment” for all of us. Let's use it to make ourselves more committed to our values, less tolerant of discrimination and disparities, more supportive of inclusion, and more courageous in our pursuit of equity and excellence, kindness, compassion, and quality medical care for the American public.

We will continue to work with the ECFMG, which serves as the “IMGs' Dean's Office,” while residents apply to US residency and fellowship programs, as well as with the AAMC, which operates the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS®) program for applicants, to provide the best available information. A set of FAQs is in the process of being finalized. We will post those as soon as they are ready, and continue to update them as information becomes available. We greatly appreciate the work of our colleagues at the AAMC and ECFMG in crafting responses to these questions with us.

We also greatly appreciate the response we have received from individuals and groups who are concerned about the physicians impacted by the EO, and the ultimate impact on patient care in the United States. We will continue to monitor the situation, assess the implications, and provide updates on behalf of our residents and fellows, GME programs and institutions, and the broad GME community. Updates can be found at on our website and on our Twitter feed.

In closing, please use this opportunity to reaffirm and articulate our values. This should include “not giving up” on our international graduate applicants this year. Our colleagues from other countries have cared for America and Americans for generations. We must not abandon them now, as they search for the American Dream we often have taken for granted. 
 
Sincerely,

I am now going to make a new post were I collect approaches and resources for the ""Memorizable list of tasks/knowledge"" list. Let's keep the momentum going! New post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3ynr6o/resources_for_the_list_of_most_bangforbuck_things/)**

**Memorizable list of tasks/knowledge:**

1) Fluids. Know why, when, how much and what to look out for.
 
2) Nausea. When to treat, how to treat and what dose.

3) Standard pn orders: pain killers, sleep aids and antiemetics aka how to reduce nighttime calls from nurses by 25%

4) ""Reflex"" antibiotic choice for routine inpatient infections. 

5) Initial work-up and treatment of heart-failure. 

6) Initial work-up and treatment of  kidney failure. 

7) A sensible initial approach to ileus. 

8) Blood. When, how, why to replace. (added by me)

9) Pain. When, how, why to manage. (added by me)

10) Potassium. When, why and how to shift or replace. Credit: /u/findmyownway

10) i) Electrolyte management in general (wide net, but valid?) /u/propofalling

10) ii) Hyponatremia. Most common electrolyte disturbance, commonly mismanaged. /u/nicholus_h2

11) Commit the ACLS algorithms to memory /u/manya_died 

12) Differentiate pulmonary edema vs. COPD exacerbation
: workup and treatment /u/Imaterribledoctor 

13) Basic EKG interpretation /u/propofalling

14) Know when to order ABGs and how to interpret them /u/crazyshadowdog


**Pearls of wisdom/general advice:**

1) Appropriate follow up. When in doubt, follow up. Credit: /u/Gawd1 

2) Respect the history. History is king. /u/fivo7 

3) Respect yourself. You are a doctor. Your patients are YOUR patients. Approach their workup accordingly. /u/LolYourAnIdiot 

4) Spend more time with patients, less time with notes. /u/Imaterribledoctor

5) Don't understimate the importance of a good social history /u/Imaterribledoctor

5) i) Always ask and document code status. You may avoid prolonging the suffering of someone who does not want it /u/metalaco

6) Build a routine, stick with it. This will help you be systematic. /u/ImClearlyAmazing 

7) If you are multitasking you are not prioritizing. Splitting your attention reduces your attention. You are not an exception to this rule. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt

8) Be brief and on-point during rounds. /u/telim

9) ""Remember there are things you know that you know, things you know that you don't know, and the largest category of all is things you don't know that you don't know."" - /u/General_Garrus

9) i) Know when to ask for help. Think about the worst case scenario that could happen for a patient in the next couple of days. If you don't feel like you can handle that, ask for help ahead of time. /u/General_Garrus

9) ii) Call consults as early as possible - it will save you some unpleasant phone conversations. /u/Obisean00

10) Keep a pen and pad handy. Write down tasks and check them off when completed. Actively prioritize /u/irish37 /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt

10) i) Write stuff down because you are a stressed out, over-worked, under-slept, under-fed human - you are going to forget unless you write it down. /u/ irish57

11) When in doubt, ask a senior. No one expects you to know everything. No one likes a know-it-all. /u/5shade

12) Prophylacticly check if everyone that needs to be on DVT prophylaxis has it. /u/dabeamer

13) Creative questioning lets you get the answers you need without ""embarrassing"" yourself: ""What do we normally do for this (general)/what have we been doing for this (patient specific)?"" is a nice way to ask support staff to remind you of usual med choice/dosing at your hospital when you forget. /u/OmNomDoubleDouble

14) Listen to and respect all of your nurses. Most of them will know more than you about your pts at this point. /u/brentonbond

15) Appropriate communication with nurses and other hospital staff. Know when to heed advice, know when to disagree with advice. Most importantly know HOW to disagree. /u/propofalling

16) Communicate with your patients (and relatives) - most of the complaints placed against doctors are because the patient wasn't kept informed on what was happening. /u/mr-mobius

16) i) If you make a mistake own up to it. A mistake is a mistake, hiding a mistake is malpractice /u/mr-mobius

17) (but probably nr. 1) Don't lie. (see comment) /u/ikkeutelukkes

18) Always ask why. This is how you learn. /u/transientz

19) Don't treat anxiety over the phone. Find out what's going on, might be nothing, could be something. /u/fisherpr

20) Go just a tiny bit beyond being polite. Small talk with other staff may seem insignificant but a reputation as a nice person will go a long way in making your life a whole lot easier /u/nooj

 
Any tips, suggestions, comments? Is there a standardized short list or reference you feel is relevant. 

EDIT: If it helps, imagine you're the attending/resident on a night-shift. List the 5 things which are so common that it would make your life a whole lot easier if all interns would initiate work-up and treatment without disturbing you.

EDITEDIT: If it helps, imagine your nephew/niece is 3 weeks away from starting their internship. They are stressed but have some down-time and ask you what is the most relevant thing to review and really understand prior to starting. You advise them to . . .

&lt;p&gt;5) i) Always ask and document code status. You may avoid prolonging the suffering of someone who does not want it &lt;a href=""/u/metalaco""&gt;/u/metalaco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Build a routine, stick with it. This will help you be systematic. &lt;a href=""/u/ImClearlyAmazing""&gt;/u/ImClearlyAmazing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) If you are multitasking you are not prioritizing. Splitting your attention reduces your attention. You are not an exception to this rule. &lt;a href=""/u/hashtag_ThisIsIt""&gt;/u/hashtag_ThisIsIt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8) Be brief and on-point during rounds. &lt;a href=""/u/telim""&gt;/u/telim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) &amp;quot;Remember there are things you know that you know, things you know that you don&amp;#39;t know, and the largest category of all is things you don&amp;#39;t know that you don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; - &lt;a href=""/u/General_Garrus""&gt;/u/General_Garrus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) i) Know when to ask for help. Think about the worst case scenario that could happen for a patient in the next couple of days. If you don&amp;#39;t feel like you can handle that, ask for help ahead of time. &lt;a href=""/u/General_Garrus""&gt;/u/General_Garrus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9) ii) Call consults as early as possible - it will save you some unpleasant phone conversations. &lt;a href=""/u/Obisean00""&gt;/u/Obisean00&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) Keep a pen and pad handy. Write down tasks and check them off when completed. Actively prioritize &lt;a href=""/u/irish37""&gt;/u/irish37&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/hashtag_ThisIsIt""&gt;/u/hashtag_ThisIsIt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10) i) Write stuff down because you are a stressed out, over-worked, under-slept, under-fed human - you are going to forget unless you write it down. /u/ irish57&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11) When in doubt, ask a senior. No one expects you to know everything. No one likes a know-it-all. &lt;a href=""/u/5shade""&gt;/u/5shade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12) Prophylacticly check if everyone that needs to be on DVT prophylaxis has it. &lt;a href=""/u/dabeamer""&gt;/u/dabeamer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13) Creative questioning lets you get the answers you need without &amp;quot;embarrassing&amp;quot; yourself: &amp;quot;What do we normally do for this (general)/what have we been doing for this (patient specific)?&amp;quot; is a nice way to ask support staff to remind you of usual med choice/dosing at your hospital when you forget. &lt;a href=""/u/OmNomDoubleDouble""&gt;/u/OmNomDoubleDouble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14) Listen to and respect all of your nurses. Most of them will know more than you about your pts at this point. &lt;a href=""/u/brentonbond""&gt;/u/brentonbond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15) Appropriate communication with nurses and other hospital staff. Know when to heed advice, know when to disagree with advice. Most importantly know HOW to disagree. &lt;a href=""/u/propofalling""&gt;/u/propofalling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) Communicate with your patients (and relatives) - most of the complaints placed against doctors are because the patient wasn&amp;#39;t kept informed on what was happening. &lt;a href=""/u/mr-mobius""&gt;/u/mr-mobius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16) i) If you make a mistake own up to it. A mistake is a mistake, hiding a mistake is malpractice &lt;a href=""/u/mr-mobius""&gt;/u/mr-mobius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17) (but probably nr. 1) Don&amp;#39;t lie. (see comment) &lt;a href=""/u/ikkeutelukkes""&gt;/u/ikkeutelukkes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18) Always ask why. This is how you learn. &lt;a href=""/u/transientz""&gt;/u/transientz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19) Don&amp;#39;t treat anxiety over the phone. Find out what&amp;#39;s going on, might be nothing, could be something. &lt;a href=""/u/fisherpr""&gt;/u/fisherpr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20) Go just a tiny bit beyond being polite. Small talk with other staff may seem insignificant but a reputation as a nice person will go a long way in making your life a whole lot easier &lt;a href=""/u/nooj""&gt;/u/nooj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips, suggestions, comments? Is there a standardized short list or reference you feel is relevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: If it helps, imagine you&amp;#39;re the attending/resident on a night-shift. List the 5 things which are so common that it would make your life a whole lot easier if all interns would initiate work-up and treatment without disturbing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDITEDIT: If it helps, imagine your nephew/niece is 3 weeks away from starting their internship. They are stressed but have some down-time and ask you what is the most relevant thing to review and really understand prior to starting. You advise them to . . . &lt;/p&gt;

Long post ahead, but I just wanted to talk about what I have been working on: 

Perhaps the most important aspect of a physician’s role is our diagnostic capabilities.  Truly, if we cannot identify and diagnose a patient’s pathology, with reasonable accuracy, we cannot effectively treat them and may even cause greater harm.  On this topic let’s look back…. The year is 1816 and you are a physician evaluating a patient with shortness of breath.  The common practice of the time was direct auscultation by placement of the practitioner’s ear on the patient’s chest.  At the time, many criticized this technique as providing little insight in the patient’s condition as well being out of normal social standards.  Secondary to these pressures, that year, French physician, Dr. Rene Laennec, invented the stethoscope, which dramatically improved the clarity of the auscultation exam.  He spent the remainder of his career correlating how the stethoscope could detect various chest pathologies, and educating the utility of this technology on improving bedside assessment.  The accumulation of his works resides in his text *De l'Auscultation Médiate,* which is one of the most widely translated medical texts in history.

Now, just over two-hundred years later, it is incredible to think that this technology has not been *disrupted*, especially when you compare the advances mankind has made in other areas.  We have gone from the horse and carriage to cars that can practically drive themselves; from the notepad to the iPad, and can now communicate anywhere on the globe irrespective of language or distance.  In healthcare as well, we have drastically altered our ability to monitor as well as treat our patients.  

Yet despite all of our technologic advances, the stethoscope remains the primary tool used at the bedside for the physical exam.  This is in spite of the widely known inaccuracies produced by the stethoscope guided physical exam.  For example, studies have demonstrated dismal results regarding the ability of the stethoscope to detect common cardiac events with a reported accuracy of 20 to 40 percent.(1,2) Even amongst cardiologists the accuracy of the stethoscope is poor.(3) 

Acceptance of this concept is key for us to innovate. One simply needs to ask themselves: how do you tell the difference between rhonchi or rales? What section of the lung did you hear diminished breath sounds? Or, where is that heart murmur emitted from and what pathology does it represent to realize the severe limitations of the stethoscope?  Moreover, when you compare the scrutiny that we require all modern medical monitors to achieve for their accuracy (no one would use a pulse oximeter that had only a 40&amp;#37; percent accuracy rate), why do we not seek a similar level of accuracy when we discuss the tools we use for our physical exam?  Fortunately, technologic advances have recently allowed for a new technology to be evaluated as **an adjunct**for our physical ex**am, point of care ultrasound (POC**US).

Similar to the evolution of computers, ultrasound machines have become much more portable (some are even pocket size) with functionality similar to “high-end” units used in imaging laboratories.  New technologies even allow one’s smartphone to become an ultrasound device.  This innovation allows the physician to have access to ultrasound imaging during their physical exam at the point of care. 

The utility of POCUS has been demonstrated for nearly every type of physical exam including: cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, pulmonary, and abdominal.  How often have you wondered: what is the ventricular function, how severe is that aortic stenosis, how bad is the COPD, is there a pneumothorax, what is the amount gastric volume, or what is the patient’s volume status?  These are all questions that have proven to be answered “real-time” by POCUS.  

Sadly, the utility for POCUS to facilitate acute care management has mostly been shown in emergency medicine and critical care specialties.(4) This has been viewed with some criticism given the fact that patients have the same comorbidities and acute care events in the perioperative setting.(5) Truly, from a patient care standpoint, why should the skillset for bedside evaluation of the patient change simply because they transition from the emergency room or intensive care unit to the perioperative setting?  

Fortunately, the utility of POCUS to improve patient care in the hospital and ambulatory perioperative settings is starting to rapidly emerge.(6,7) Interest in perioperative point of care ultrasound (P-POCUS) has been reported by anesthesiology trainees along with integration of P-POCUS curriculums into residency training.(8) Moreover, implementation of a perioperative POCUS service has also demonstrated a positive clinical impact.(8) 

While it is encouraging to see the growth of P-POCUS there is much more that can be developed.  Other specialties have developed formalized educational and certification pathways.(5)  Emergency medicine has adopted POCUS training as a “core competency” for residency training. Currently, the certification and educational processes for the perioperative setting are limited, but the concept is growing.

A collaboration of academic programs including Loma Linda University Medical Center, UCI Medical Center, and UCLA Medical Center are working together to help address the need for education and training on this topic.  Every year, more academic programs are developing training curriculums on P-POCUS. 

One such curriculum, termed F.O.R.E.S.I.G.H.T. (Focused periOperative Risk Evaluation Sonography Involving Gastroabdominal Hemodynamic and Transthoracic ultrasound ) has been published as an effective strategy for education. This curriculum incorporates the topics of: 1) Cardiac, 2) Pulmonary, 3) Hemodynamic, 4) Gastro-Abdominal 5) Airway, 6) Vascular access, and 7) Intracranial pressure assessment and highlights their relevance for the perioperative setting.  To further P-POCUS education this curriculum is now online and is open access, under a Creative Commons license ([www.foresightultrasound.com](http://www.foresightultrasound.com/)).  Additionally, training workshops on this curriculum are now available as well at [www.pocuseducation.com](http://www.pocuseducation.com/).

Other specialties have developed formalized educational and certification pathways.(5)  Emergency medicine has adopted POCUS training as a “core competency” for residency training. Currently, the certification and educational processes for the perioperative setting are limited, but the concept is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collaboration of academic programs including Loma Linda University Medical Center, UCI Medical Center, and UCLA Medical Center are working together to help address the need for education and training on this topic.  Every year, more academic programs are developing training curriculums on P-POCUS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such curriculum, termed F.O.R.E.S.I.G.H.T. (Focused periOperative Risk Evaluation Sonography Involving Gastroabdominal Hemodynamic and Transthoracic ultrasound ) has been published as an effective strategy for education. This curriculum incorporates the topics of: 1) Cardiac, 2) Pulmonary, 3) Hemodynamic, 4) Gastro-Abdominal 5) Airway, 6) Vascular access, and 7) Intracranial pressure assessment and highlights their relevance for the perioperative setting.  To further P-POCUS education this curriculum is now online and is open access, under a Creative Commons license (&lt;a href=""http://www.foresightultrasound.com/""&gt;www.foresightultrasound.com&lt;/a&gt;).  Additionally, training workshops on this curriculum are now available as well at &lt;a href=""http://www.pocuseducation.com/""&gt;www.pocuseducation.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. Please if you have any questions or want to start a discussion on this topic I welcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes because someone didn't follow them, sometimes because someone claimed they were followed the wrong way.

We rarely discuss why we have the guidelines we have, and never if this constitutes the standard of care, if it is evidence based guidelines or if it is a list of what some people think you should do.

The latter is true, and it is actually based on animal studies during the 60ies, namely [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from asphyxia.* JAMA. 1962 Oct 20;182:283-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13973494/) and [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. Drug therapy.* JAMA. 1968 Jan 22;203(4):255-60.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5694097/) where the second one found

&gt; Resuscitation [of dogs] was more successful when epinephrine was used than when no drug therapy or sodium bicarbonate were used. 

**Vasopressors**

The ACLS algorithm since at least 2009 have included adrenaline/epinephrine 1mg every 3-5 minutes. This is based on a single randomized study ([Jacobs IG, Finn JC, Jelinek GA, Oxer HF, Thompson PL. *Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.* Resuscitation. 2011 Sep;82(9):1138-43. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21745533) which is best summarized by their own conclusion

&gt; Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.

ROSC isn't the end result of CPR, survivability is. The same conclusion is shown in other retrospective studies as well, e.g. [Hagihara A, Hasegawa M, Abe T, Nagata T, Wakata Y, Miyazaki S. *Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2012 Mar 21;307(11):1161-8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22436956) which concludes that while more patient in the epinephrine/adrenaline group achieved ROSC they were equally likely (actually slightly less likely) to be discharged.

Another study found that among patients who are at a hospital when they fall into cardiac arrest early ephinehrine/adrenaline push (as within 2 min of the first defibrillation which is against the guidelines that says after defibrillation nr 2) is associated with a worse outcome, per [Andersen LW, Kurth T, Chase M, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Callaway C, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Investigators. *Early administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) in patients with cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm in hospital: propensity score matched analysis.* BMJ. 2016 Apr 6;353:i1577.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27053638)  
It is a short article, well worth a read (and it is open access), but here is an excerpt
&gt; In conclusion, we found that early administration of epinephrine after the first defibrillation (that is, contrary to guidelines) was common (&gt;50%) in patients who experience cardiac arrest in hospital with a shockable rhythm. Moreover, the provision of epinephrine at this time point was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome, including decreased in hospital survival.

**The AHA guidelines**

The ACLS guidelines are heavily based on the [AHA guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956224/).  They say
&gt; It is **reasonable to consider** administering a 1 mg dose of IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest.

Reasonable to consider is the wording used. Think about that for a minute. 

I would also like to add that high doses of epinephrine/adrenaline is associated with a worse outcome. If that is because the patient is in cardiac arrest for longer, or because the people doing it are less experienced and doesn't follow protocol is hard for me to say. 

**Amiodarone**

There are 2 studies (ALIVE and ARREST). Neither was powered to really detect what we are interested in (survivability). 

The first of these two, [Dorian P, Cass D, Schwartz B, Cooper R, Gelaznikas R, Barr A. *Amiodarone as compared with lidocaine for shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 2002 Mar 21;346(12):884-90.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11907287) found that more patients who got amiodarone was admitted to the hospital, but failed to show (due to how it was constructed) that they were discharged more often. The second trial ([Kudenchuk PJ, Cobb LA, Copass MK, Cummins RO, Doherty AM, Fahrenbruch CE, Hallstrom AP, Murray WA, Olsufka M, Walsh T. *Amiodarone for resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 1999 Sep 16;341(12):871-8.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10486418) showed the same, but didn't focus on survival to hospital discharge.

Therefor the evidence is lacking. And again from the AHA  
&gt; Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO.

**Edit 1.** /u/transmogrification pointed me towards another study, more recent then the above, [Kudenchuk PJ et al. *Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest*. N Engl J Med. 2016 May 5;374(18):1711-22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27043165). This study concludes that

&gt; neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.

but also

&gt; Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered.

So there still may be a difference, but you would need 9000 study participants to find it with a 90% certainty. If it did have an effect of ca 3% that would be 1800 lives per year it could save, but the data as is doesn't support an effect larger than 3%.

**Fibrinolysis**

A lot of cardiac arrests are due to PE or AMI, and it would there go to reason that treating the clots would have an effect on survival. The problem is that when you give tPA you don't actually know why the patient went into cardiac arrest, and there hasn't been shown any benefit (a bit better effect on survival to ICU admission has been found), see [Böttiger BW, Arntz HR, Chamberlain DA, Bluhmki E, Belmans A, Danays T, Carli PA, Adgey JA, Bode C, Wenzel V; TROICA Trial Investigators; European Resuscitation Council Study Group. *Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.* N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 18;359(25):2651-62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19092151) and [Böttiger BW, Bode C, Kern S, Gries A, Gust R, Glätzer R, Bauer H, Motsch J, Martin E. *Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial.* Lancet. 2001 May 19;357(9268):1583-5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377646).

If we could select the right patients that may change, and with an increased amount of ultrasound used by ICU docs and even used during CPR we may be at a point where it is worth redoing such a study at a hospital (my own point of view).

**Edit 2** As pointed out by the PEAPETT study [Sharifi M, Berger J, Beeston P, Bay C, Vajo Z, Javadpoor S; “PEAPETT” investigators. *Pulseless electrical activity in pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis (from the ""PEAPETT"" study).* Am J Emerg Med. 2016 Oct;34(10):1963-1967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422214) and /u/macreadyrj there have been newer studies then the ones cited above. However PEAPETT included 23 patients where 16 had a previous diagnosis of PE by CT pulmonary angiography, which isn't the case for a random cardiac arrest and 3 were diagnosed with PE by ultrasound criteria. I would thus interpret the study more as a safety study than anything else, since it also didn't show any significant bleedings. 

**Sodium bicarb**

The AHA states
&gt; There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance.

And the study this is based at least partly on [Vukmir RB, Katz L; Sodium Bicarbonate Study Group. *Sodium bicarbonate improves outcome in prolonged prehospital cardiac arrest*. Am J Emerg Med. 2006 Mar;24(2):156-61.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16490643) which despite the name states
&gt; **The empirical early administration of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) has no effect on the overall outcome in prehospital cardiac arrest.** However, a trend toward improvement in prolonged (&gt;15 minutes) arrest outcome was noted.

It should be said that there are specific circumstances were bicarb has it's use, but routinely using it simply hasn't been shown effective as stated by the AHA
&gt; In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial

**Edit 3. Endotracheal Intubation** 

Per the AHA
&gt; However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.

There aren't any high quality studies and only a few retrospective studies, one of them saying that early intubation has a trend toward better survival at 24hrs; [Wong ML, Carey S, Mader TJ, Wang HE; American Heart Association National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Investigators. *Time to invasive airway placement and resuscitation outcomes after inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest*. Resuscitation. 2010 Feb;81(2):182-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022157) and one study of poorly trained EMS on intubation of children failed to find an effect (and remember we think that ventilation is more important in children than in adults) [Gausche M, Lewis RJ. *Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation of children*. JAMA. 2000 Jun 7;283(21):2790-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10838643).

A more recent study in Japan [Hasegawa K, Hiraide A, Chang Y, Brown DF. *Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2013 Jan 16;309(3):257-66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321764) found that
&gt; Among adult patients with OHCA [out of hospital cardiac arrest], any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.

You also have another study, [Kajino K, Iwami T, Kitamura T, Daya M, Ong ME, Nishiuchi T, Hayashi Y, Sakai T, Shimazu T, Hiraide A, Kishi M, Yamayoshi S. *Comparison of supraglottic airway versus endotracheal intubation for the pre-hospital treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. Crit Care. 2011;15(5):R236.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985431) which found two things. A supraglottic airway is equally effective to endotracheal intubation, but having a person certified to do endotracheal intubation was associated with a better outcome regardless of wether they did or didn't. Early placement of an advanced airway was associated with a better outcome.

**Edit 4**
Thanks to dr /u/CytokineShitStorm for pointing me to this study, [Andersen LW, Granfeldt A, Callaway CW, Bradley SM, Soar J, Nolan JP, Kurth T, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators. *Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival*. JAMA. 2017 Feb 7;317(5):494-506.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118660) which is a 2017 observational study on cardiac arrest in the hospital setting which found
&gt;Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with improved outcomes in any subgroup. [...] Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.

and thus it doesn't support intubating patients even at a hospital setting. As the guidelines stand intubation may still be the way to go, and by intubating the patient you may free up valuable resources. I always have an ICU/OR/anesthesia nurse present who can maintain any advanced airway or ventilate the patient if necessary so for me it wouldn't tie up any more hands to not intubate the patient. 

**Summary**
High quality CPR and defibrillate as soon as possible. The rest is mostly guesses.

&lt;p&gt;The latter is true, and it is actually based on animal studies during the 60ies, namely &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13973494/""&gt;Redding JS, Pearson JW. &lt;em&gt;Resuscitation from asphyxia.&lt;/em&gt; JAMA. 1962 Oct 20;182:283-6.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5694097/""&gt;Redding JS, Pearson JW. &lt;em&gt;Resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. Drug therapy.&lt;/em&gt; JAMA. 1968 Jan 22;203(4):255-60.&lt;/a&gt; where the second one found&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resuscitation [of dogs] was more successful when epinephrine was used than when no drug therapy or sodium bicarbonate were used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vasopressors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLS algorithm since at least 2009 have included adrenaline/epinephrine 1mg every 3-5 minutes. This is based on a single randomized study (&lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21745533""&gt;Jacobs IG, Finn JC, Jelinek GA, Oxer HF, Thompson PL. &lt;em&gt;Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.&lt;/em&gt; Resuscitation. 2011 Sep;82(9):1138-43. &lt;/a&gt; which is best summarized by their own conclusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROSC isn&amp;#39;t the end result of CPR, survivability is. The same conclusion is shown in other retrospective studies as well, e.g. &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22436956""&gt;Hagihara A, Hasegawa M, Abe T, Nagata T, Wakata Y, Miyazaki S. &lt;em&gt;Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest&lt;/em&gt;. JAMA. 2012 Mar 21;307(11):1161-8&lt;/a&gt; which concludes that while more patient in the epinephrine/adrenaline group achieved ROSC they were equally likely (actually slightly less likely) to be discharged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another study found that among patients who are at a hospital when they fall into cardiac arrest early ephinehrine/adrenaline push (as within 2 min of the first defibrillation which is against the guidelines that says after defibrillation nr 2) is associated with a worse outcome, per &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27053638""&gt;Andersen LW, Kurth T, Chase M, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Callaway C, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Investigators. &lt;em&gt;Early administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) in patients with cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm in hospital: propensity score matched analysis.&lt;/em&gt; BMJ. 2016 Apr 6;353:i1577.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It is a short article, well worth a read (and it is open access), but here is an excerpt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we found that early administration of epinephrine after the first defibrillation (that is, contrary to guidelines) was common (&amp;gt;50%) in patients who experience cardiac arrest in hospital with a shockable rhythm. Moreover, the provision of epinephrine at this time point was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome, including decreased in hospital survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AHA guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ACLS guidelines are heavily based on the &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956224/""&gt;AHA guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.  They say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;reasonable to consider&lt;/strong&gt; administering a 1 mg dose of IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasonable to consider is the wording used. Think about that for a minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to add that high doses of epinephrine/adrenaline is associated with a worse outcome. If that is because the patient is in cardiac arrest for longer, or because the people doing it are less experienced and doesn&amp;#39;t follow protocol is hard for me to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amiodarone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 studies (ALIVE and ARREST). Neither was powered to really detect what we are interested in (survivability). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these two, &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11907287""&gt;Dorian P, Cass D, Schwartz B, Cooper R, Gelaznikas R, Barr A. &lt;em&gt;Amiodarone as compared with lidocaine for shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/em&gt; N Engl J Med. 2002 Mar 21;346(12):884-90.&lt;/a&gt; found that more patients who got amiodarone was admitted to the hospital, but failed to show (due to how it was constructed) that they were discharged more often. The second trial (&lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10486418""&gt;Kudenchuk PJ, Cobb LA, Copass MK, Cummins RO, Doherty AM, Fahrenbruch CE, Hallstrom AP, Murray WA, Olsufka M, Walsh T. &lt;em&gt;Amiodarone for resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/em&gt; N Engl J Med. 1999 Sep 16;341(12):871-8.&lt;/a&gt; showed the same, but didn&amp;#39;t focus on survival to hospital discharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefor the evidence is lacking. And again from the AHA  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""/u/transmogrification""&gt;/u/transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; pointed me towards another study, more recent then the above, &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27043165""&gt;Kudenchuk PJ et al. &lt;em&gt;Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest&lt;/em&gt;. N Engl J Med. 2016 May 5;374(18):1711-22.&lt;/a&gt;. This study concludes that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but also&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there still may be a difference, but you would need 9000 study participants to find it with a 90% certainty. If it did have an effect of ca 3% that would be 1800 lives per year it could save, but the data as is doesn&amp;#39;t support an effect larger than 3%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibrinolysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of cardiac arrests are due to PE or AMI, and it would there go to reason that treating the clots would have an effect on survival. The problem is that when you give tPA you don&amp;#39;t actually know why the patient went into cardiac arrest, and there hasn&amp;#39;t been shown any benefit (a bit better effect on survival to ICU admission has been found), see &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19092151""&gt;Böttiger BW, Arntz HR, Chamberlain DA, Bluhmki E, Belmans A, Danays T, Carli PA, Adgey JA, Bode C, Wenzel V; TROICA Trial Investigators; European Resuscitation Council Study Group. &lt;em&gt;Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&lt;/em&gt; N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 18;359(25):2651-62&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377646""&gt;Böttiger BW, Bode C, Kern S, Gries A, Gust R, Glätzer R, Bauer H, Motsch J, Martin E. &lt;em&gt;Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial.&lt;/em&gt; Lancet. 2001 May 19;357(9268):1583-5.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we could select the right patients that may change, and with an increased amount of ultrasound used by ICU docs and even used during CPR we may be at a point where it is worth redoing such a study at a hospital (my own point of view).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2&lt;/strong&gt; As pointed out by the PEAPETT study &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422214""&gt;Sharifi M, Berger J, Beeston P, Bay C, Vajo Z, Javadpoor S; “PEAPETT” investigators. &lt;em&gt;Pulseless electrical activity in pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis (from the &amp;quot;PEAPETT&amp;quot; study).&lt;/em&gt; Am J Emerg Med. 2016 Oct;34(10):1963-1967&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""/u/macreadyrj""&gt;/u/macreadyrj&lt;/a&gt; there have been newer studies then the ones cited above. However PEAPETT included 23 patients where 16 had a previous diagnosis of PE by CT pulmonary angiography, which isn&amp;#39;t the case for a random cardiac arrest and 3 were diagnosed with PE by ultrasound criteria. I would thus interpret the study more as a safety study than anything else, since it also didn&amp;#39;t show any significant bleedings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium bicarb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AHA states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the study this is based at least partly on &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16490643""&gt;Vukmir RB, Katz L; Sodium Bicarbonate Study Group. &lt;em&gt;Sodium bicarbonate improves outcome in prolonged prehospital cardiac arrest&lt;/em&gt;. Am J Emerg Med. 2006 Mar;24(2):156-61.&lt;/a&gt; which despite the name states&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The empirical early administration of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) has no effect on the overall outcome in prehospital cardiac arrest.&lt;/strong&gt; However, a trend toward improvement in prolonged (&amp;gt;15 minutes) arrest outcome was noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be said that there are specific circumstances were bicarb has it&amp;#39;s use, but routinely using it simply hasn&amp;#39;t been shown effective as stated by the AHA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3. Endotracheal Intubation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the AHA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t any high quality studies and only a few retrospective studies, one of them saying that early intubation has a trend toward better survival at 24hrs; &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022157""&gt;Wong ML, Carey S, Mader TJ, Wang HE; American Heart Association National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Investigators. &lt;em&gt;Time to invasive airway placement and resuscitation outcomes after inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest&lt;/em&gt;. Resuscitation. 2010 Feb;81(2):182-6.&lt;/a&gt; and one study of poorly trained EMS on intubation of children failed to find an effect (and remember we think that ventilation is more important in children than in adults) &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10838643""&gt;Gausche M, Lewis RJ. &lt;em&gt;Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation of children&lt;/em&gt;. JAMA. 2000 Jun 7;283(21):2790-2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more recent study in Japan &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321764""&gt;Hasegawa K, Hiraide A, Chang Y, Brown DF. &lt;em&gt;Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest&lt;/em&gt;. JAMA. 2013 Jan 16;309(3):257-66&lt;/a&gt; found that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among adult patients with OHCA [out of hospital cardiac arrest], any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have another study, &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985431""&gt;Kajino K, Iwami T, Kitamura T, Daya M, Ong ME, Nishiuchi T, Hayashi Y, Sakai T, Shimazu T, Hiraide A, Kishi M, Yamayoshi S. &lt;em&gt;Comparison of supraglottic airway versus endotracheal intubation for the pre-hospital treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest&lt;/em&gt;. Crit Care. 2011;15(5):R236.&lt;/a&gt; which found two things. A supraglottic airway is equally effective to endotracheal intubation, but having a person certified to do endotracheal intubation was associated with a better outcome regardless of wether they did or didn&amp;#39;t. Early placement of an advanced airway was associated with a better outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4&lt;/strong&gt;
Thanks to dr &lt;a href=""/u/CytokineShitStorm""&gt;/u/CytokineShitStorm&lt;/a&gt; for pointing me to this study, &lt;a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118660""&gt;Andersen LW, Granfeldt A, Callaway CW, Bradley SM, Soar J, Nolan JP, Kurth T, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators. &lt;em&gt;Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival&lt;/em&gt;. JAMA. 2017 Feb 7;317(5):494-506.&lt;/a&gt; which is a 2017 observational study on cardiac arrest in the hospital setting which found&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with improved outcomes in any subgroup. [...] Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and thus it doesn&amp;#39;t support intubating patients even at a hospital setting. As the guidelines stand intubation may still be the way to go, and by intubating the patient you may free up valuable resources. I always have an ICU/OR/anesthesia nurse present who can maintain any advanced airway or ventilate the patient if necessary so for me it wouldn&amp;#39;t tie up any more hands to not intubate the patient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;
High quality CPR and defibrillate as soon as possible. The rest is mostly guesses. &lt;/p&gt;

I do not look at the chart before I go into a room. I walk in cold. I enter with no idea who is going to be in there or why. In that very first second, before anyone speaks, I try to guess what the story is, who the people in the room are, and why they are in my emergency room.

Here—maybe it would make more sense if I showed you.

I draw back the curtain and step into Trauma Room Two. My eyes scan quickly about, gathering as much information as they can.

There are three people in the room.

For a brief second, I intentionally do not look at the patient lying on the hospital bed, not yet. Two people accompany the patient, a man and a woman. The man sits on a hard plastic chair pushed back against the room’s wall, staring quietly ahead. I start with him. I know if I can just look closely enough, the story is there.

I study him. He is in his late forties. He wears a jet-black business suit. The fine fabric lies starkly against a bright, white, collared dress shirt. The dress shirt is pressed and starched and clean. He shifts slightly in the chair, and the red silk tie around his neck catches the light just so, drawing my eye to it. Small square gold icons fill the tie in an exact and set pattern. The knot at the top is tied with perfect precision and symmetry. This means something. I look more closely.

On his left wrist, he wears a Rolex. The bands are polished silver and cradle an oyster-white face on which three hands mark the time, the smallest of which ticks along, second by second by second. The outside of the watch face is meticulously trimmed in gold and clearly asserts to all who see it that this man’s time is expensive.

As I observe, he moves his wrist a fraction of an inch, and the whole thing explodes into shimmers, sparkling magnificently from just the weak fluorescent lights overhead. It dawns on me that his watch alone costs more than the car I drove to work this morning. I cannot help but think, “This man is nothing like me.”

I have learned I have to be careful with people like him. A single misstep in our interaction can easily result in a long string of complaint letters. But it is OK. I have done this enough that it does not frighten me or anger me or even annoy me. It is just a dance I have to be conscious of in this room. I make a mental note to be careful, and then continue my study.

Atop his head sits black hair with just a dusting of silver—executive hair, I believe it is called. It is thick and full and glowing with virility. Every strand is carefully combed into place. His hair shines nearly as brightly as his watch.

He lifts his head just slightly to look at me, and I notice a tiny cluster of hair is out of place. Just above and behind his left ear, the small bunch breaks from the linear strands around it, twisting up in disarray. It is not much, but it is there. On a man like him, it is nothing and everything at the same time. 

Something is wrong.

His face is clean-shaven, the skin healthy and bright. Two black, sharp, crisp Italian eyebrows sit above pale blue, intelligent eyes that read me in a glance, as quickly as I read him. A strong jaw cuts the angle of his face into the space of the room around it. He does not need to smile for me to know his teeth will be perfect and symmetrical and white.

Under each eye hangs a faint dark circle. He has not been sleeping well. I am guessing, of course, but it looks to be more than just work fatigue. Perhaps a struggle outside of work has started to spill over into what must be an all-consuming drive for achievement. Or perhaps it is nothing other than the tracks left on him from another successful merger. I cannot tell—not yet.

It is strange to see someone like him here, even if he is just accompanying the patient. I am an ER doctor in a small emergency room, in a small hospital, in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. I can’t help but wonder how a man like him ends up in an ER out here so far from the city. He does not have the look of someone who has come to hunt or fish, and he is definitely no wheat farmer. But something has pulled him here from far away, something that could not wait. I look closer.

The lines, curves, and circles of his face come together into an expression that is hard, at first, for me to read. I can sense he is a master at controlling what his face reveals. But my job is to read faces and bodies as well as he reads the stock market. In the curve of his mouth, I read frustration. In the angle of his brow, I read anger. In the tilt of his head, I read even a trace of fear.

But there is something else—something he does not want anyone to see. He hides it so well, after so much practice and time, I almost miss it. In fact, I am sure I would have missed it when I first started out, 41,422 patients ago. But that was then.

There, like a single, delicate, fleeting strand woven through a cloth of steel, is a tenderness and a sadness. What it is doing inside a man like him—I cannot comprehend. I can see why he wants to—no, why he has to—hide it in his world. He works to obscure it in the glint of his eyes and the shine of what must be a string of brutal successes. But still it is there.

Now that I see it, I see it clearly. It has blindsided him like a flash flood in the spring, sweeping him off his feet and tossing him down a canyon from which he cannot escape. He is drowning in this maelstrom of sadness, and no amount of money, power, or rage against the universe can make it abate. 

An empty chair sits next to him.

One chair over is a woman.

She is slightly younger than the man.

I cannot see her face; her body is turned partially away from me.

She is resting her elbows on her knees, looking at the screen of her phone. She cradles it lovingly like a newborn. Marvelous red nails stand out against a white-and-gold iPhone. Her fingers are long and elegant like those of a famous pianist or a brain surgeon. She taps and slides the icons on the screen with elegance, as if they are servants being sent to do her bidding.

Her forearms are bare and hairless, but it is her biceps that stand out. They are small, solid, and precise, like an exclamation point stamped onto each upper arm. Biceps like that shout yoga, Pilates, personal trainers, green smoothies, and a lock on the bathroom door after big holiday meals.

Long brown hair is pulled back into a ponytail that falls gracefully to the middle of her back. A small silver clasp studded with diamonds traps the hair behind her head, holding it in place. It out-shimmers even the man’s Rolex.

She wears a light gold, silk shirt. There is a cutout in the top back of it. I can just barely see her upper spine under the skin. Each vertebra makes a small bump in the arch of her lower neck, and each one is the exact same distance from the one above and below it. There are no outliers, no overly large or overly small bones. Each rise in her skin is exactly the same size and distance from the other. Before this moment, I did not realize bones in a back could be so flawless.

The skin over the bones is a rich, deep tan. It glows from her vegan diet and vitamin regimen. As she taps her finger on the phone, little ripples appear in the muscles of her back. I cannot help but stare in awe of such royalty stopping in our humble town.

She, too, is obviously nothing like me.

On the floor by her feet sits a purse. Its handle is a bent half circle of bamboo attached with gold and silver clasps to the bag below. The bamboo is polished and smooth. The wood is a blend of browns. A creamy white winds through the handle, somehow offsetting the dark tones and grains of the wood.

The purse itself looks to my unsophisticated eye not unlike the color of a wet pack horse after it has crossed a deep stream. It is a different shade of brown from the bamboo. It is like no brown I have ever seen before. As I look more closely, I see it is a bright, full, radiant brown that I can only compare to the soil on the edge of town in the spring. Soil that is freshly turned and waiting for seeds to spring up from it with life. Silver clasps and bamboo buttons adorn the purse in a perfect harmony of style. But there is something else—something that strikes me as oddly awful, something that should never be.

The purse has fallen over. The perfect brown of its side rests against our faded linoleum floor. Its contents spill out under the chair, untouched.
 
My second is almost up.

Now, at last, I turn to the patient.

A man lies on the bed. The pointed toes of scuffed cowboy boots stick up like two sharp rocks in a field. Straw and dirt pepper them and have shaken off onto the sheets. A pair of old blue jeans covers the top of the boots. They, too, have brought pieces of the farm and fields into the ER.

The man is supposed to be in a hospital gown. All our patients are. But more often than not, men around here will refuse to take off their boots and jeans. Sometimes I walk into rooms, and cowboy hats still sit perched atop heads. It is just part of living in this corner of the world.

The thighs of his jeans are faded where he must wipe his hands when in the fields. He must be right-handed, as the right thigh is faded much more than the left. A thick, worn leather belt with a buckle the size of two fists holds up jeans on a waist that is much too skinny. 

The belt buckle is a flat grayish silver with an image stamped onto the front. A bronco bucks wildly, and a cowboy on top holds on with one hand strapped snug to the horse and the other in the air for balance. His hat is spiraling off his head into the air above him. “Pendleton Round-Up Champion 1942” is etched across the top, and the words “Let ’Er Buck” are below. In an odd way, I realize he, too, is nothing like me.

The man lies shirtless on the bed. The hairs of his chest are gray. A tattoo of marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima is inked just above his heart. The whole tattoo moves up and down with his gasping.

I look to his face.

It is tired and worn and ready to stop fighting. I see that multiple rounds of chemotherapy have taken all his hair, leaving behind nothing but eyebrows. His skin sags, and there is no light remaining in his eyes. They stare blankly ahead. Drops of sweat gather and cluster on his brow as I watch. The end is near.

The man and the woman stand up to join me at the bedside. The woman stands on one side, her diamond-clad hand gently resting on the old man’s shoulder. The man who came with her stands on the other, his strong fingers lovingly resting on the thick skin of the old man’s sunburnt neck. 

I look from face to face to face, and I am surprised to see tears falling on every single one. The tears roll past similar noses, shared chins, and pale blue eyes. The pieces fall into place before me.

A daughter and a son have come home to say good-bye to their father.

I watch as the brother and sister sit down on either side of the bed. The old man, still gasping for air, suddenly sees them. With a struggle, he lifts his arms. The brother and sister lean in against their father. He lowers his arms across their shoulders as if they are still children. They rest their heads against his, curling up against his bony frame while he pants and waits for the end.

Standing before them, it suddenly hits me.

I have made a terrible mistake.

They are all just like me.

&lt;p&gt;His face is clean-shaven, the skin healthy and bright. Two black, sharp, crisp Italian eyebrows sit above pale blue, intelligent eyes that read me in a glance, as quickly as I read him. A strong jaw cuts the angle of his face into the space of the room around it. He does not need to smile for me to know his teeth will be perfect and symmetrical and white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under each eye hangs a faint dark circle. He has not been sleeping well. I am guessing, of course, but it looks to be more than just work fatigue. Perhaps a struggle outside of work has started to spill over into what must be an all-consuming drive for achievement. Or perhaps it is nothing other than the tracks left on him from another successful merger. I cannot tell—not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is strange to see someone like him here, even if he is just accompanying the patient. I am an ER doctor in a small emergency room, in a small hospital, in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. I can’t help but wonder how a man like him ends up in an ER out here so far from the city. He does not have the look of someone who has come to hunt or fish, and he is definitely no wheat farmer. But something has pulled him here from far away, something that could not wait. I look closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines, curves, and circles of his face come together into an expression that is hard, at first, for me to read. I can sense he is a master at controlling what his face reveals. But my job is to read faces and bodies as well as he reads the stock market. In the curve of his mouth, I read frustration. In the angle of his brow, I read anger. In the tilt of his head, I read even a trace of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is something else—something he does not want anyone to see. He hides it so well, after so much practice and time, I almost miss it. In fact, I am sure I would have missed it when I first started out, 41,422 patients ago. But that was then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, like a single, delicate, fleeting strand woven through a cloth of steel, is a tenderness and a sadness. What it is doing inside a man like him—I cannot comprehend. I can see why he wants to—no, why he has to—hide it in his world. He works to obscure it in the glint of his eyes and the shine of what must be a string of brutal successes. But still it is there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I see it, I see it clearly. It has blindsided him like a flash flood in the spring, sweeping him off his feet and tossing him down a canyon from which he cannot escape. He is drowning in this maelstrom of sadness, and no amount of money, power, or rage against the universe can make it abate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An empty chair sits next to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One chair over is a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is slightly younger than the man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot see her face; her body is turned partially away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is resting her elbows on her knees, looking at the screen of her phone. She cradles it lovingly like a newborn. Marvelous red nails stand out against a white-and-gold iPhone. Her fingers are long and elegant like those of a famous pianist or a brain surgeon. She taps and slides the icons on the screen with elegance, as if they are servants being sent to do her bidding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her forearms are bare and hairless, but it is her biceps that stand out. They are small, solid, and precise, like an exclamation point stamped onto each upper arm. Biceps like that shout yoga, Pilates, personal trainers, green smoothies, and a lock on the bathroom door after big holiday meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long brown hair is pulled back into a ponytail that falls gracefully to the middle of her back. A small silver clasp studded with diamonds traps the hair behind her head, holding it in place. It out-shimmers even the man’s Rolex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wears a light gold, silk shirt. There is a cutout in the top back of it. I can just barely see her upper spine under the skin. Each vertebra makes a small bump in the arch of her lower neck, and each one is the exact same distance from the one above and below it. There are no outliers, no overly large or overly small bones. Each rise in her skin is exactly the same size and distance from the other. Before this moment, I did not realize bones in a back could be so flawless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skin over the bones is a rich, deep tan. It glows from her vegan diet and vitamin regimen. As she taps her finger on the phone, little ripples appear in the muscles of her back. I cannot help but stare in awe of such royalty stopping in our humble town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She, too, is obviously nothing like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the floor by her feet sits a purse. Its handle is a bent half circle of bamboo attached with gold and silver clasps to the bag below. The bamboo is polished and smooth. The wood is a blend of browns. A creamy white winds through the handle, somehow offsetting the dark tones and grains of the wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purse itself looks to my unsophisticated eye not unlike the color of a wet pack horse after it has crossed a deep stream. It is a different shade of brown from the bamboo. It is like no brown I have ever seen before. As I look more closely, I see it is a bright, full, radiant brown that I can only compare to the soil on the edge of town in the spring. Soil that is freshly turned and waiting for seeds to spring up from it with life. Silver clasps and bamboo buttons adorn the purse in a perfect harmony of style. But there is something else—something that strikes me as oddly awful, something that should never be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purse has fallen over. The perfect brown of its side rests against our faded linoleum floor. Its contents spill out under the chair, untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second is almost up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at last, I turn to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man lies on the bed. The pointed toes of scuffed cowboy boots stick up like two sharp rocks in a field. Straw and dirt pepper them and have shaken off onto the sheets. A pair of old blue jeans covers the top of the boots. They, too, have brought pieces of the farm and fields into the ER.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man is supposed to be in a hospital gown. All our patients are. But more often than not, men around here will refuse to take off their boots and jeans. Sometimes I walk into rooms, and cowboy hats still sit perched atop heads. It is just part of living in this corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thighs of his jeans are faded where he must wipe his hands when in the fields. He must be right-handed, as the right thigh is faded much more than the left. A thick, worn leather belt with a buckle the size of two fists holds up jeans on a waist that is much too skinny. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belt buckle is a flat grayish silver with an image stamped onto the front. A bronco bucks wildly, and a cowboy on top holds on with one hand strapped snug to the horse and the other in the air for balance. His hat is spiraling off his head into the air above him. “Pendleton Round-Up Champion 1942” is etched across the top, and the words “Let ’Er Buck” are below. In an odd way, I realize he, too, is nothing like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man lies shirtless on the bed. The hairs of his chest are gray. A tattoo of marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima is inked just above his heart. The whole tattoo moves up and down with his gasping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look to his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tired and worn and ready to stop fighting. I see that multiple rounds of chemotherapy have taken all his hair, leaving behind nothing but eyebrows. His skin sags, and there is no light remaining in his eyes. They stare blankly ahead. Drops of sweat gather and cluster on his brow as I watch. The end is near.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man and the woman stand up to join me at the bedside. The woman stands on one side, her diamond-clad hand gently resting on the old man’s shoulder. The man who came with her stands on the other, his strong fingers lovingly resting on the thick skin of the old man’s sunburnt neck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look from face to face to face, and I am surprised to see tears falling on every single one. The tears roll past similar noses, shared chins, and pale blue eyes. The pieces fall into place before me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A daughter and a son have come home to say good-bye to their father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watch as the brother and sister sit down on either side of the bed. The old man, still gasping for air, suddenly sees them. With a struggle, he lifts his arms. The brother and sister lean in against their father. He lowers his arms across their shoulders as if they are still children. They rest their heads against his, curling up against his bony frame while he pants and waits for the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standing before them, it suddenly hits me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a terrible mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are all just like me.&lt;/p&gt;

During my first and only office visit, my surgeon did not take any history nor do an exam and did not take any notes. He dictated my history from memory a day after my OV, and thus confused me with another patient. He dictated the wrong surgery, wrong condition, wrong procedure, wrong symptoms into a separate admit note he created. My consent form, however, was correct, so on the day of surgery,  I  signed it, not knowing he had created a separate admit form he used during surgery. He then altered my consent form without my knowledge or signature. Ultimately, I ended up with two different dictations  with two different diagnosis and surgeries detailed, in my chart but no one read or compared the two. There are many other errors in my chart, but I have highlighted the most significant. 

The surgery went ahead according to his mistaken dictation. Instead of my tiny microsurgical procedure, he performed a three-level, broad decompressive laminectomy for a patient with spinal stenosis, and removed three levels of the bones of my spine. He also left the herniated discs I was there to have treated.  I woke up in hell. The pain was unbearable.  Since  the consent form said I had had a micro-discectomy, PACU nurses had no idea a completely different and much more invasive surgery had taken place. I was sent home 1 1/2 hours after having my spine cut out on three levels with a bone saw.

Ultimately, there were many other factors that led to this horrific situation for me. The details  would be clear to an informed reader, but are incomprehensible to non-medical people. The surgeon lied relentlessly during the trial and won, due largely to the inability of the jury to wade through all the technical information. Which I understand, because a typical cross-section of American citizens cannot learn the legal system, surgical techniques, neurosurgery, or how to read an MRI in the four days allotted to a malpractice trial. This inability is what he and his legal team relied upon, as this technique has evidently worked for him during innumerable other malpractice lawsuits, none of which were allowed into evidence during my trial.

The system seems virtually impossible to navigate. Trying to demonstrate truth in a sea of technicalities and deliberate obfuscations by defense attorneys made it nearly impossible to isolate the actual facts in my case. So I'm wondering if professional jurors might help. Another   thing that could change this nightmare for patients would be a law insisting upon surgeries being filmed and recorded. If my surgery had been filmed, there would be absolutely no question he performed the wrong procedure and that no meaningful time-out took place. Anyone who understands medical record keeping can see what happened to me. Every single document in the case supported my claim, but all he had to say was that he knew he changed the surgery, but that he had discovered something additional that required this change of procedure. Of course, he did not get any consent to change the procedure, nor did he tell me or my husband that he found something different. Nor was there any evidence at all that such a different condition existed anywhere. Additionally, the operative report discusses no such change, but starts out: ""the laminectomy was begun..."". At no point was any mention made of a change in procedure or findings, and the post OR report says the procedure went ""as scheduled, no changes made.""   In fact, he never once mentioned any change in procedure to anyone.  I only discovered it myself months later only after obtaining my own MRI reports.

Airline pilots have every move and word documented, but surgeons, who are plunging scalpels into our bodies while we lie naked and vulnerable on their tables, are allowed to operate behind a veil of secrecy.  if a mistake is made, they use obfuscation to confuse the facts so that ordinary citizens cannot understand what really happened and thus, give the surgeon an advantage  we cannot battle. 

I am now permanently disabled.

Help me generate a practical list of actionable tips on ""**How to communicate with a really busy person**"".

Examples on from my own experience are

* **never reply ""thank you"" to an email** - if you are genuinely thankful, send a card. Otherwise, the most sincere thanks is letting their inbox stay empty for an extra 15 minutes
* **send anything that can be answered by the secretary to the secretary** - the administrative assistant knows exactly what the doctor needs to see, and can respond to many questions directly. You will get a faster answer, and the physician won't have to pay your attention tax
* **one issue per email** - since the inbox functions as a defacto ""to do"" list, don't put a long email with four different things you need in a single message ; make each one a message, and make them all succinct
* **make the subject meaningful** - the best email is the one you don't even need to open, because the subject says it all
* **use (NNTR) in the subject** - when you *have* to say something, but also don't need a reply back, put (NNTR) as the very first item in the subject. This tells the recipient that there is **N**o **N**eed **T**o **R**espond, which is an emotional gift when the inbox is full.

Surgical nurse here. I've been nursing for 5 years, and I deal with multiple staff docs and residents on a daily basis. I hear a lot from nurses about how doctors could make our jobs easier, but I haven't heard from you on how we can make your jobs easier.

You're busy. You have way more patients than I do. How can a nurse ensure that she or he is utilizing you appropriately? What do we do that helps you do your job? What do we do that hinders your ability to provide appropriate patient care?

What do you wish nurses knew?
